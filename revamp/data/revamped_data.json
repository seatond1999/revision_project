All sugars can be classified as reducing or non-reducing. The Benedict's test tests for sugars \u2014 it differs depending on the type of sugar you are testing for.1)2)3)Reducing sugars include all monosaccharides (e.g. glucose) and some disaccharides (e.g. maltose and lactose).You add Benedict's reagent (which is blue) to a sample and heat it in a water bath that's been brought to the boil.If the test's positive it will form a coloured precipitate (solid particles suspended in the solution).The colour of the precipitate changes from:blue-\u00a3> green>=>-yellowH>orange=4> brick redr Alwars us\u00ab an excess of r Z Benedict's solution \u2014 ;Z thls mak\u00ab sure that all ~ Z the sugar reacts. z1 1 1 \" I I I I I I M M | | | V\\N4)The higher the concentration of reducing sugar, the further the colour change goes \u2014 you can use this to compare the amount of reducing sugar in different solutions. A more accurate way of doing this is to filter the solution and weigh the precipitate.C\/1d\u00a3<UD1X1UZuDOLUIzO1) If the result of the reducing sugars test is negative, there could still be a non-reducing sugar present. To test for non-reducing sugars, like sucrose, first you have to break them down into monosaccharides.2) You do this by getting a new sample of the test solution, adding dilute hydrochloric acid and carefully heating it in a water bath that's been brought to the boil. You then neutralise it with sodium hydrogencarbonate. Then just carry out the Benedict's test as you would for a reducing sugar.3) If the test's positive it will form a coloured precipitate (as for the reducing sugars test). If the test's negative the solution will stay blue, which means it doesn't contain any sugar (either reducing or non-reducing).Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","2":"72Factors Affecting Enzyme ActivityNow you know what enzymes are and how they work, let's take a look at what makes them tick. Humans need things like money and the newest mobile phone, but enzymes are quite content with the right temperature and pH.Temperature has a Big Influence on Enzyme ActivityLike any chemical reaction, the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction increases when the temperature's increased. More heat means more kinetic energy, so molecules move faster. This makes the enzymes more likely to collide with the substrate molecules. The energy of these collisions also increases, which means each collision is more likely to result in a reaction. But, if the temperature gets too high, the reaction stops.1) The rise in temperature makes the enzyme's molecules vibrate more.2) If the temperature goes above a certain level, this vibration breaks some of the bonds that hold the enzyme in shape.3) The active site changes shape and the enzyme and substrate no longer fit together.4) At this point, the enzyme is denatured\u2014 it no longer functions as a catalyst.optimum temperature11 nn 11,TemperaturepH Also Affects Enzyme ActivityO\u2019\" \" I M I | | | ,, , ,~ Every enzyme has an enzyme is r optimum temperature = denatured r For most human enzymes - r ,t,saro^37\u00b0C but some r _ enzymes, like those used in ~- biological washing powders, ~ ~ can work well at 60 \u00b0C ~All enzymes have an optimum pH value. Most human enzymes work best at pH 7 (neutral), but there are exceptions. Pepsin, for example, works best at acidic pH 2, which is useful because it's found in the stomach. Above and below the optimum pH, the H+ and OH ions found in acids and alkalis can mess up the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds that hold the enzyme's tertiary structure in place. This makes the active site change shape, so the enzyme is denatured.Enzyme Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction1) The more enzyme molecules there are in a solution,the more likely a substrate molecule is to collide with one and form an enzyme-substrate complex. So increasing the concentration of the enzyme increases the rate of reaction.2) But, if the amount of substrate is limited, there comes a point when there's more than enough enzyme molecules to deal with all the available substrate, so adding more enzyme has no further effect.steady increase as more active sites are available \\if substrate amount is limited, an increase in enzyme concentration eventually has no further effectEnzyme ConcentrationSubstrate Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction Up to a Pointsteady increase as more substrate molecules are availableall active sites used \u2014 increase in substrate concentration has no further effectSubstrate Concentration1) The higher the substrate concentration, the faster the reaction \u2014 more substrate molecules means a collision between substrate and enzyme is more likely and so more active sites will be used. This is only true up until a 'saturation' point though. After that, there are so many substrate molecules that the enzymes have about as much as they can cope with(all the active sites are full), and adding more makes no difference.2) Substrate concentration decreases with time during a reaction (unless more substrate is added to the reaction mixture), so if no other variables are changed, the rate of reaction will decrease over time too. This makes the initial rate of reaction (the reaction rate at the start) the highest rate of reaction.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n13Factors Affecting Enzyme ActivityEnzyme Activity can be InhibitedEnzyme activity can be prevented by enzyme inhibitors Inhibition can be competitive or non-competitive.COMPETITIVE INHIBITIONmolecules that bind to the enzyme that they inhibit.1) Competitive inhibitor molecules have a similar shape to that of the substrate molecules.2) They compete with the substrate molecules to bind to the active site, but no reaction takes place.3) Instead they block the active site, so no substrate molecules can fit in it. ienzymesubstrateinhibitor molecule fits into active site because it is a similar shape to the substrate moleculeenzyme-controlled reaction without an inhibitorsame reaction with a competitive inhibitor \u2014 rate increases as substrate concentration is increasedSubstrate Concentration4) How much the enzyme is inhibited depends on the relative concentrations of the inhibitor and the substrate.5) If there's a high concentration of the inhibitor, it'll take up nearly all the active sites and hardly any of the substrate wil get to the enzyme.6) But if there's a higher concentration of substrate, then the substrate's chances of getting to an active site before the inhibitor increase. So increasing the concentration of substrate will increase the rate of reaction (up to a point).NON-COMPETITIVE INHIBITION1) Non-competitive inhibitor molecules bind to the enzyme away from its active site.2) This causes the active site to change shape so the substrate molecules can no longer bind to it.3) They don't 'compete' with the substrate molecules to bind to the active site because they are a different shape.4) Increasing the concentration of substrate won't make any difference to the reaction rate \u2014 enzyme activity will still be inhibited.inhibitor molecule fits onto enzyme away from active siteenzymesubstrate molecule can no longer fit into active siteVXinhibitor causes changes that alter active sitensCZ.nsO'enzyme-controlled reaction without an inhibitorsame reaction with a non-competitive inhibitor \u2014 increasing the substrate conc. has little effect on rateiSubstrate ConcentrationPractice QuestionsQ1 Draw a graph to show the effect of temperature on enzyme activity.Q2 Draw a graph to show the effect of pH on enzyme activity.Q3 Explain the effect of increasing substrate concentration on the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction.Exam QuestionQ1 Inhibitors prevent enzymes from working properly.

You might be asked to interpret the graph of an enzyme-controlled reaction in the exam. The graph below shows the release of a product over time:Volume of product released by an enzyme-controlled reaction at different temperatures\u201c 50 '\u00a9 First look at the start of the graph and compare the rates of reaction here. E.g. the rate of reaction is fastest at 65 \u00b0C. Use what you know about factors affecting enzyme activity to explain why (see p. 12). You might have to work out the initial rate of reaction (see below).i i(T) Nov\/ look at what else the graphs are showing you and make comparisons between the different temperatures. At 37 \u00b0C the graph has plateaued (flattened out) because all the substrate has been used up.At 65 \u00b0C the graph has plateaued earlier than at 37 \u00b0C, because the high temperature caused the enzyme to denature, so the reaction stopped sooner. Not as much product was made because not all the substrate was converted to product before the enzyme was denatured, so there is still substrate left.At 25 \u00b0C the rate of reaction is remaining constant and the volume of product is continuing to increase because not all of the substrate has been used up.You Can Use a Tangent to Calculate the Initial Rate of ReactionThe initial rate of reaction is the rate of reaction right at the start of the reaction, close to time equals zero (t = 0) on the graph. To work out the initial rate of reaction carry out the following steps:Volume of product released by an enzyme-controlled reaction at 37 \u00b0C\n20 30 40Time (s)Practice Question1) Draw a tangent to the curve at t = 0, using a ruler.

These molecules are needed to build proteins, which are required for the cells in living organisms to function. They're right handy little things.DNA and RNA Carry Important InformationDNA and RNA are both types of nucleic acid. They're found in all living cells and they both carry information.1) DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is used to store genetic information \u2014 that's all the instructions an organism needs to grow and develop from a fertilised egg to a fully grown adult.2) RNA (ribonucleic acid) is similar in structure to DNA. One of its main functions is to transfer genetic information from the DNA to the ribosomes. Ribosomes are the body's 'protein factories' \u2014 they read the RNA to make polypeptides (proteins) in a process called translation (see p. 85). Ribosomes themselves are made from RNA and proteins.DNA and RNA are Polymers of Nucleotides1) A nucleotide is a type of biological molecule. It's made from:Nucleotidenitrogen-containing\u2022 a pentose sugar (that's a sugar with 5 carbon atoms),\u2022 a nitrogen-containing organic base, ^\u201e,,,, n M ^\u2022 a phosphate group. r Organic' means that =----------------------------------------------------------------~ it contains carbon. \"\"711111 n W 1111111, | |C2) Nucleotides are really important. For a start, they're the monomers (see p. 2) that make up DNA and RNA.The Sugar in DNA is Called Deoxyribose1) The pentose sugar in a DNA nucleotide DNA nucleotideis called deoxyribose.2) Each DNA nucleotide has the same sugar and a phosphate group. The base on each nucleotide can vary though.3) There are four possible bases \u2014 adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C) and guanine (G).The Sugar in RNA is Called Ribose1) RNA contains nucleotides with a ribose sugar (not deoxyribose).2) Like DNA, an RNA nucleotide also has a phosphate group and one of four different bases.3) In RNA though, uracil (U) replaces thymine as a base.RNA nucleotide\nMary didn't care if it was ribose or deoxyribose, she just wanted her cuppa.Topic 7 B \u2014 More Biological Molecules\n77DNA and RNANucleotides Join Together to Form Polynucleotides1) A polynucleotide is a polymer of nucleotides.Both DNA and RNA nucleotides form polynucleotides.2) The nucleotides join up via a condensation reaction (see p. 2) between the phosphate group of one nucleotide and the sugar of another.3) This forms a phosphodiester bond (consisting of the phosphate group and two ester bonds).4) The chain of sugars and phosphates is known as the sugar-phosphate backbone.Part of a single polynucleotide strandPhosphodiester bondEster bondSugar-phosphatebackboneDNA is Made of Two Polynucleotide Chains in a Double-Helix Structure1) Two DNA polynucleotide strands join together by _ . . ... .. i I. Two joined polynucleotide strandshydrogen bonding between the bases.2) Each base can only join with one particular partner \u2014 this is called complementary base pairing (or specific base pairing).3) Adenine always pairs with thymine (A -T) and cytosine always pairs with guanine (C - G). This means that there are always equal amounts of adenine and thymine in a DNA molecule and equal amounts of cytosine and guanine.4) Two hydrogen bonds form between A and T, and three hydrogen bonds form between C and G.5) Two antiparallel (running in opposite directions) polynucleotide strands twist to form the DNA double-helix.6) DNA was first observed in the 1800s, but lots of scientists at the time doubted that it could carry the genetic code because it has a relatively simple chemical composition. Some argued that genetic information must be carried by proteins \u2014 which are much more chemically varied.7) By 1953, experiments had shown that DNA was the carrier of the genetic code. This v\/as also the year in which the double-helix structure, which helps DNA to carry out its function, was determined by Watson and Crick.RNA is a Relatively Short Polynucleotide ChainRNA is made from a single polynucleotide chain (not a double one).

This means that there's genetic continuity between generations of cells (i.e. the cells produced by cell division inherit their genes from their parent cells).1)The enzyme DNA helicase breaks the hydrogen bondsbetween bases on the two polynucleotide DNA strands.

In a DNA helix, the strands run in opposite directions \u2014 they're antiparallel.The active site of DNA polymerase is only complementary to the 3' endof the newly forming DNA strand \u2014 so the enzyme can only add nucleotides to the new strand at the 3' end.This means that the new strand is made in a 5' to 3' direction and that 3'- DNA polymerase moves down the template strand in a 3' to 5' direction. Because the strands in the double-helix are antiparallel, the DNA polymerase working on one of the template strands moves in the opposite direction to the DNA polymerase working on the other template strand.DNA Polymerase\nDNA PolymeraseTopic 1B \u2014 More Biological Molecules\n79DNA ReplicationMeselson and Stahl Provided Evidence for Semi-Conservative Replication1) You might remember from page 17 that Watson and Crick determined the structure of DNA.They also came up with the theory of semi-conservative DNA replication.2) It wasn't until Meselson and Stahl's experiment a few years later that this theory was validated.Before that, people were unsure whether DNA replication was semi-conservative or conservative.If the method was conservative, the original DNA strands would stay together and the new DNA molecules would contain two new strands.3) Meselson and Stahl showed that DNA is replicated using the semi-conservative method, r differentT *** -Their experiment used two isotopes of nitrogen (DNA contains nitrogen) j s<am^ orms \u00a3\u2014 heavy nitrogen (15N) and light nitrogen (,4N). Here's how it worked: '\/ftntnw,Initial DNA sample CD Initial DNA sample containing light nitrogen containing heavy nitrogen<DLight DNA settled out here in centrifuge tubeHeavy nitrogen bacteria replicates in light nitrogen brothConservative 0\nDNA with only heavy original strands and only light new strands would settle out here.Heavy DNA settled out here in centrifuge tube\nSemi-conservative\nDNA with a combination of heavy original strands and light new strands settled out here.1) Two samples of bacteria were grown \u2014 one in a nutrient broth containing light nitrogen, and one in a broth with heavy nitrogen. As the bacteria reproduced, they took up nitrogen from the broth to help make nucleotides for new DNA. So the nitrogen gradually became part of the bacteria's DNA.2) A sample of DNA was taken from each batch of bacteria, and spun in a centrifuge. The DNA from the heavy nitrogen bacteria settled lower down the centrifuge tube than the DNA from the light nitrogen bacteria \u2014 because it's heavier.3) Then the bacteria grown in the heavy nitrogen broth were taken out and put in a broth containing only light nitrogen. The bacteria were left for one round of DNA replication, and then another DNA sample was taken out and spun in the centrifuge.4) If replication was conservative, the original heavy DNA, which would still be together, would settle at the bottom and the new light DNA would settle at the top.5) If replication was semi-conservative, the new bacterial DNA molecules would contain one strand of the old DNA containing heavy nitrogen and one strand of new DNA containing light nitrogen. So the DNA would settle out between where the light nitrogen DNA settled out and where the heavy nitrogen DNA settled out.6) As it turned out, the DNA settled out in the middle, showing that the DNA molecules contained a mixture of heavy and light nitrogen. The bacterial DNA had replicated semi-conservatively in the light nitrogen.Once Meselson and Stahl had confirmed that DNA replication in bacteria was semi-conservative, other scientists carried out experiments to show that it was the universal method for DNA replication in all living things.Practice QuestionsQ1 What is the role of DNA helicase in DNA replication?Q2 What's the key difference between the conservative and semi-conservative theories of DNA replication?Exam QuestionQ1 Dcscribc the process of semi-conservative DNA replication.

You'll need to think about what organelles the cell needs to do its job \u2014 e.g. if the cell uses a lot of energy, it'll need lots of mitochondria. If it makes a lot of proteins it'll need a lot of ribosomes.Example:1)2)3)Epithelial cells in the small intestine are specialised to absorb food efficiently.The walls of the small intestine have lots of finger-like projections microvilli increasei \u2022 \/\u2022 ft surface areacalled villi. These increase surface area for absorption.The epithelial cells on the surface of the villi have folds in their cell-surface nucleusmembranes, called microvilli. Microvilli increase surface area even more. ^cytoplasmThey also have lots of mitochondria \u2014 to provide energy forthe transport of digested food molecules into the celL mitochondriaSpecialised Cells are Organised into Tissues, Organs and Organ Systems1) In multicellular eukaryotic organisms, specialised cells are grouped together to form tissues.2) A tissue is a group of cells working together to perform a particular function.3) Different tissues work together to form organs. Different organs make up an organ system.For example...Epithelial cells make up epithelial tissue. Epithelial tissue, muscular tissue and glandular tissue(which secretes chemicals) all work together to form the stomach \u2014 an organ. The stomach is part of the digestive system \u2014 this is an organ system made up of all the organs involved in the digestion and absorption of food (including the small intestine, large intestine and liver).Practice QuestionsQ1 What is a plant cell wall made of?

It's basically the opposite of a condensation reaction.3) For example, carbohydrates can be broken down into their constituent monosaccharides by hydrolysis reactions.PolymerAHydrolysis \u2014 the bond is broken by theaddition of a water molecule-OH HO--OHEven hydrolysis couldn't break this bond.Use the Benedict\u2019s Test for SugarsSugar is a general term for monosaccharides and disaccharides. All sugars can be classified as reducing or non-reducing. The Benedict's test tests for sugars \u2014 it differs depending on the type of sugar you are testing for.1)2)3)Reducing sugars include all monosaccharides (e.g. glucose) and some disaccharides (e.g. maltose and lactose).You add Benedict's reagent (which is blue) to a sample and heat it in a water bath that's been brought to the boil.If the test's positive it will form a coloured precipitate (solid particles suspended in the solution).The colour of the precipitate changes from:blue-\u00a3> green>=>-yellowH>orange=4> brick redr Alwars us\u00ab an excess of r Z Benedict's solution \u2014 ;Z thls mak\u00ab sure that all ~ Z the sugar reacts. z1 1 1 \" I I I I I I M M | | | V\\N4)The higher the concentration of reducing sugar, the further the colour change goes \u2014 you can use this to compare the amount of reducing sugar in different solutions. A more accurate way of doing this is to filter the solution and weigh the precipitate.C\/1d\u00a3<UD1X1UZuDOLUIzO1) If the result of the reducing sugars test is negative, there could still be a non-reducing sugar present. To test for non-reducing sugars, like sucrose, first you have to break them down into monosaccharides.2) You do this by getting a new sample of the test solution, adding dilute hydrochloric acid and carefully heating it in a water bath that's been brought to the boil. You then neutralise it with sodium hydrogencarbonate. Then just carry out the Benedict's test as you would for a reducing sugar.3) If the test's positive it will form a coloured precipitate (as for the reducing sugars test). If the test's negative the solution will stay blue, which means it doesn't contain any sugar (either reducing or non-reducing).Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n4CarbohydratesSo, you've already looked at monosaccharides and disaccharides... now it's time to give polysaccharides some love.Polysaccharides are Loads of Sugars Joined TogetherA polysaccharide is formed when more than two monosaccharides are joined together by condensation reactions.\na-glucose a-glucose a-glucose a-glucose a-glucoseYou need to know about the relationship between the structure and function of three polysaccharides\u2014 starch, glycogen and cellulose.Starch is the Main Energy Storage Material in Plants\none alpha-glucose molecule1) Cells get energy from glucose. Plants store excess glucose as starch (when a plant needs more glucose for energy, it breaks down starch to release the glucose).2) Starch is a mixture of two polysaccharides of alpha-glucose \u2014 amylose and amylopectin:\u2022 Amylose \u2014 a long, unbranched chain of a-glucose. The angles of the glycosidic bonds give it a coiled structure, almost like a cylinder. This makes it compact, so it's really good for storage because you can fit more in to a small space.\u2022 Amylopectin \u2014 a long, branched chain of a-glucose. Its side branches allow the enzymes that break down the molecule to get at the glycosidic bonds easily.This means that the glucose can be released quickly. Amylopectin3) Starch is insoluble in water and doesn't affect water potential (see page 40), so it doesn't cause water to enter cells by osmosis, which would make them swell.This makes it good for storage.Use the Iodine Test for StarchIf you do any experiment on the digestion of starch and want to find out if any is left, you'll need the iodine test.just add iodine dissolved in potassium iodide solution to the test sample. If there is starch present, the sample changes from browny-orange to a dark, blue-black colour.Glycogen is the Main Energy Storage Material in AnimalsGlycogen1) Animal cells get energy from glucose too.But animals store excess glucose as glycogen\u2014 another polysaccharide of alpha-glucose.2) Its structure is very similar to amylopectin, except that it has loads more side branches coming off it. Loads of branches means that stored glucose can be released quickly, which is important for energy release in animals.3) It's also a very compact molecule, so it's good for storage.After throwing and fetching the ball no less than 312 times, Chappy and Stuart were finally out of glycogen.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","13":"24Topic 2A \u2014 Cell Structure and DivisionEukaryotic Cells and OrganellesThere are two types of cell \u2014 prokaryotic and eukaryotic.

You'll need to think about what organelles the cell needs to do its job \u2014 e.g. if the cell uses a lot of energy, it'll need lots of mitochondria. If it makes a lot of proteins it'll need a lot of ribosomes.Example:1)2)3)Epithelial cells in the small intestine are specialised to absorb food efficiently.The walls of the small intestine have lots of finger-like projections microvilli increasei \u2022 \/\u2022 ft surface areacalled villi.

Different organs make up an organ system.For example...Epithelial cells make up epithelial tissue. Epithelial tissue, muscular tissue and glandular tissue(which secretes chemicals) all work together to form the stomach \u2014 an organ. The stomach is part of the digestive system \u2014 this is an organ system made up of all the organs involved in the digestion and absorption of food (including the small intestine, large intestine and liver).Practice QuestionsQ1 What is a plant cell wall made of?

This means you can't use an optical microscope to view organelles smaller than 0.2 pm. That includes ribosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes. You may be able to make out mitochondria \u2014 but not in perfect detail. You can also see the nucleus.3) The maximum useful magnification of an optical microscope is about x 1500.1) TEMs use electromagnets to focus a beam of electrons, which is then transmitted through the specimen.2) Denser parts of the spccimcn absorb more electrons, which makes them look darker on the image you end up with.3) TEMs are good because they give high resolution images, so you see the internal structure of organelles like chloroplasts.4) But they can only be used on thin specimens.Electron microscopes ---------------------------------1) They use electrons to form an image.2) They have a higher resolution than optical microscopes so give a more detailed image (and can be used to look at more organelles).3) They have a maximum resolution of about 0.0002 micrometres (|jm). (About 1000 times higher than optical microscopes.)4) The maximum useful magnification of an electron microscope is about x 1 500 000.'1 \"1111' 11 u ii 111 m in ii\/ A micrometre (jjm) is three - orders of magnitude smaller z than a millimetre (1 ym = -0.001 mm).

Stains are used to highlight objects in a cell. For example, eosin is used to make the cytoplasm show up. Iodine in potassium iodide solution (see p. 4) is used to stain starch grains in plant cells.\u2022 Finally, add the cover slip (a square of clear plastic that protects the specimen). To do so, stand the slip upright on the slide, next to the water droplet. Then carefully tilt and lower it so it covers the specimen.Try not to get any air bubbles under there \u2014 they'll obstruct your view of the specimen (see page 35).Topic 2A \u2014 Cell Structure and Division\n","15":"31Analysis of Cell ComponentsCell Fractionation Separates OrganellesSuppose you wanted to look at some organelles under an electron microscope. First you'd need to separate them from the rest of the cell \u2014 you can do this by cell fractionation. There are three steps to this technique:(7) Homogenisation \u2014 Breaking Up the Cells jHomogenisation can be done in several different ways, e.g. by vibrating the cells or by grinding the cells up in a blender. This breaks up the plasma membrane and releases the organelles into solution. The solution must be kept ice-cold, to reduce the activity of enzymes that break down organelles. The solution should also be isotonic \u2014 this means it should have the same concentration of chemicals as the cells being broken down, to prevent damage to the organelles through osmosis. A buffer solution should be added to maintain the pH.(7) Filtration \u2014 Getting Rid of the Big Bits )Next, the homogenised cell solution is filtered through a gauze to separate any large cell debris or tissue debris, like connective tissue, from the organelles.The organelles are much smaller than the debris, so they pass through the gauze.(3) Ultracentrifugation \u2014 Separating the Organelles JAfter filtration, you're left with a solution containing a mixture of organelles. To separate a particular organelle from all the others you use ultracentrifugation.1) The cell fragments are poured into a tube. The tube is put into a centrifuge (a machine that separates material by spinning) and is spun at a low speed. The heaviest organelles, like nuclei, get flung to the bottom of the tube by the centrifuge. They form a thick sediment at the bottom\u2014 the pellet. The rest of the organelles stay suspended in the fluid above the sediment \u2014 the supernatant.2) The supernatant is drained off, poured into another tube, and spun in the centrifuge at a higher speed.Again, the heaviest organelles, this time the mitochondria, form a pellet at the bottom of the tube. The supernatant containing the rest of the organelles is drained off and spun in the centrifuge at an even higher speed.3) This process is repeated at higher and higher speeds, until all the organelles are separated out. Each time, the pellet at the bottom of the tube is made up of lighter and lighter organelles.As the ride got faster, everyone felt their nuclei sink to their toes..- Plant cells,~ the chloroplasts :Z corne out after the = ~ nuclei, but before ~z. the mitochondria. - . . \" \" '1111111 \\ 1 n'endoplasmicreticulumribosomeslysosomesmitochondrianuclei\u2019The organelles are separatedorder of mass(from heaviest to lightest) \u2014 this order is usually: nuclei, then mitochondria, then lysosomes, then endoplasmic reticulum, and finally ribosomes.Practice QuestionsQ1 What is meant by a microscope's magnification?Q2 What is meant by a microscope's resolution?Exam QuestionsQ1 The table shows the dimensions of some different organelles found in animal cells.Name those organelles in the table that would be visible using a good quality light microscope.Explain your answer.

A plant root tip is constantly growing, so you'd expect a high mitotic index (i.e. lots of cells in mitosis).

You'll also need to label your drawing.High and low power objective lensesThe Mitotic Index Is the Proportion of Cells Undergoing MitosisYou can calculate the mitotic index of your cells using this formula:mitotic index =number of cells with visible chromosomes total number of cells observedThis lets you work out how quickly the tissue is growing and if there's anything weird going on. A plant root tip is constantly growing, so you'd expect a high mitotic index (i.e. lots of cells in mitosis). In other tissue samples, a high mitotic index could mean that tissue repair is taking place or that there is cancerous growth in the tissue.Topic 2 A \u2014 Cell Structure and Division\n35Cell Division \u2014 Investigating MitosisYou Can Use A Graticule and Micrometer to Calculate the Size of Cells...1) You need to be able to calculate the size of the cells you're looking at.That's where the eyepiece graticule and stage micrometer come in \u2014 they're a bit like rulers.2) An eyepiece graticule is fitted onto the eyepiece. It's like a transparent ruler with numbers, but no units.3) The stage micrometer is placed on the stage \u2014 it is a microscope slide with an accurate scale (it has units) and it's used to work out the value of the divisions on the eyepiece graticule at a particular magnification.4) This means that when you take the stage micrometer away and replace it with the slide containing your tissue sample, you'll be able to measure the size of the cells. Here's an example:4.5. eyepiece divisions = 1 stage divisionEyepiece graticule 10 20 30 40 5020301 division = 0.1 mm Stage micrometer.Or You Can Use This Formula..D2)3)4)5)Line up the eyepiece graticule and the stage micrometer.Each division on the stage micrometer is 0.1 mm long.At this magnification, 1 division on the stage micrometer is the same as 4.5 divisions on the eyepiece graticule.To work out the size of 1 division on the eyepiece graticule,you need to divide 0.1 by 4.5:1 division on eyepiece graticule = 0.1 4.5 = 0.022 mmSo if you look at a cell under the microscope at this magnificationand it\u2019s 4 eyepiece divisions long, you know it measures:4 x 0.022 = 0.088 mm. 1 11111111' i11i 111111 n 111\/ j 11111 u Z The eyepiece graticule will need to be Z - re-calibrated at different magnifications. -11111111111 n 111 m 11111111111 n i ii FIf you're given an image of cells under the microscope in the exam, you can calculate their actual size using this formula:Example: If the image of a cell measures 5 mm and the magnification is x 100, then the actual size of the cell will be: 5 \u2022*-100 = 0.05 mm.actual size =size of image magnificationArtefacts Can Get in the Way of Your Observations1) Artefacts are things that you can see down the microscope that aren't part of the cell or specimen that you're looking at.2) They can be anything from bits of dust, air bubbles and fingerprints, The new organelle Steveto inaccuracies caused by scjjashf^and staining your sample. had discovered looked just3) Artefacts are usually made during the preparation of your slides and shouldn't really be I'ke his thumb print, there at ail \u2014 you'll need to prepare your root tip cells carefully to avoid creating artefacts.Artefacts are especially common in electron micrographs because specimens need a lot of preparation before you can view them under an electron microscope. The first scientists to use these microscopes could only distinguish between artefacts and organelles by repeatedly preparing specimens in different ways. If an object could be seen with one preparation technique, but not another, it was more likely to be an artefact than an organelle.Practice QuestionsQ1 Why do you need to squash the tissue when preparing a slide of plant root tip cells?Exam QuestionQ1 A sample of cells was prepared to observe mitosis.

Using a graticule is tricky, but once you get your head round it you'll be fine.Topic 2 A \u2014 Cell Structure and Division\n","17":"36Topic 2B \u2014 Cell MembranesCell Membrane StructureYou might remember a bit about cell membranes from p. 25. Well now it's time to delve a little deeper...Membranes Control What Passes Through ThemAll cells are surrounded by membranes. In eukaryotic cells,many of the organelles are surrounded by membranes too.1)2)Cell-surface membranes surround cells. They are a barrier between the cell and its environment, controlling which substances enter and leave the cell. They're partially permeable \u2014 they let some molecules through but not others. Substances can move across the cell-surface membrane by diffusion, osmosis or active transport (see pages 38-43).The membranes around organelles divide the cell into different compartments \u2014 they act as a barrier between the organelle and the cytoplasm. They are also partially permeable and control what substances enter and leave the organelle.Cell Membranes have a Fluid Mosaic\u2019 StructurePartially permeable membranes can be useful at sea.The basic structure of all cell membranes is pretty much the same. They're composed of lipids (mainly phospholipids \u2014 see page 7), proteins and carbohydrates (attached to proteins or lipids).1)2)3)4)5)In 1972, the fluid mosaic model was suggested to describe the arrangement of molecules in the membrane.

They bind to the cholesterolhydrophobic tails of the phospholipids, causing them to pack more closely together.This restricts the movement of the phospholipids, making the membrane less fluid and more rigid.Cholesterol helps to maintain the shape of animal cells (which don't have cell walls). This is particularly important for cells that aren't supported by other cells, e.g. red blood cells, which float free in the blood.Topic 2B \u2014 Cell Membranes\n37Cell Membrane StructureThe Permeability of the Cell Membrane can be Investigated in the LabThe permeability of cell membranes is affected by different conditions, e.g. temperature and solvent concentration. You can investigate how these things affect permeability by doing an experiment using beetroot. Beetroot cells contain a coloured pigment that leaks out \u2014 the higher the permeability of the membrane, the more pigment leaks out of the cell. Here's how you could investigate how temperature affects beetroot membrane permeability:1) Use a scalpel to carefully cut five equal sized pieces of beetroot. (Make sure you do your cutting on a cutting board.) Rinse the pieces to remove any pigment released during cutting.2) Add the five pieces to five different test tubes, each containing 5 cm3 of water.Use a measuring cylinder or pipette to measure the water.3) Place each test tube in a water bath at a different temperature, e.g. 10 \u00b0C, 20 \u00b0C, 30 40 \u00b0C, 50 \u00b0C, for the same length of time (measured using a stopwatch).4) Remove the pieces of beetroot from the tubes, leaving just the coloured liquid.5) Now you need to use a colorimeter \u2014 a machine that passes light through the liquid and measures how much of that light is absorbed. The higher the absorbance, the more pigment released, so the higher the permeability of the membrane.6) You can connect the colorimeter to a computer and use software to collect the data and draw a graph of the results.\u00b0C,'ii 11 i 11 n ii 1111111,11111 ^- Colorimeters needr 5 minutes to stabilise before E- using and calibrating at zero -- by taking a measurement ~ ~ through pure water. \u2014\\ 11 i i ii n i ii j h 11 j n 111Increasing the Temperature Increases Membrane PermeabilityExperiments like the one above have shown that membrane permeability changes with temperature:(J) Temperatures below 0 \u00b0C \u2014 the phospholipids don't have much energy, so they can t move very much.

This continues until particles are evenly distributed throughout the liquid or gas.3) The concentration gradient is the path from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Particles diffuse down a concentration gradient4) Diffusion is a passive process \u2014 no energy is needed for it to happen.5) Particles can diffuse across cell membranes, as long as they can move freely through the membrane.111' h 1 I I I  I  I IF! , M,,,, (\/Polar molecules have Z ~ Partlal positive and negative ~ charges (see p. 20).

They're also non-polar, which makes them soluble in lipids, so they can dissolve in the hydrophobic bilayer.6) When molecules diffuse directly through a cell membrane, it's also known as simple diffusion.Facilitated Diffusion uses Carrier Proteins and Protein Channels1) Some larger molecules (e.g. amino acids, glucose) would diffuse extremely slowly through the phospholipid bilayer because they're so big.2) Charged particles, e.g. ions and polar molecules, would also diffuse slowly \u2014 that'sbecause they're water soluble, and the centre of the bilayer is hydrophobic (see page 36).3) So to speed things up, large or charged particles diffuse through carrier proteins or channel proteins in the membrane instead \u2014 this is called facilitated diffusion.4) Like diffusion, facilitated diffusion moves particles down a concentration gradient, from a higher to a lower concentration.5) It's also a passive process \u2014 it doesn't use energy.'fiAndy needed all his concentration for this particular gradient...Carrier proteins move large molecules across membranes, down their concentration gradient.

So the greater the number of channel or carrier proteins in the cell membrane, the faster the rate of facilitated diffusion.Having more channel proteins increases the rate of facilitated diffusion _____________Aquaporins are special channel proteins that allow the facilitated diffusion of waterthrough cell membranes.

First though, you need to make up several solutions of different, known concentrations to test the cylinders in.

You now have 10 cm3 of solution that's half as concentrated as the solution in the first test tube (it's 1 M).4)Repeat this process three more times to create solutions of 0.5 M, 0.25 M and 0.125 M.10 cm of 2 M sucrose solution5 cm\" of distilled waterTopic 2B \u2014 Cell Membranes\n41Exchange Across Cell Membranes \u2014 OsmosisYou Can Also Make Solutions of Different Concentrations By Finding the Scale FactorYou can make sucrose solutions of any concentration by finding the scale factor.For example, if you want to make 15 cm3 of 0.4 M sucrose solution...1) Start with a solution of a known concentration, e.g. 1 M.2) Find the scale factor by dividing the concentration of this solution by the concentration ofthe solution you want to make. So in this case the scale factor = 1 M -=- 0.4 M = 2.5.3) This means that the solution you want to make is 2.5 times weaker than the one you have.To make the solution 2.5 times weaker, use 2.5 times less of it, i.e. 15 cm3 4 2.5 = 6 cm3.Transfer this amount to a clean test tube.4) Top up the test tube with distilled water to get the volume you want to make.In this case you want to make 15 cm3 of solution, so you need to add: 15-6 = 9 cm3 of distilled water.Use Your Solutions To Find the Water Potential of Potato Cells20 -101) Use a cork borer to cut potatoes into identically sized chips, about 1 cm in diameter.2) Divide the chips into groups of three and measure the mass of each group using a mass balance.3) Place one group into each of your sucrose solutions.4) Leave the chips in the solutions for at least 20 minutes(making sure that they all get the same amount of time).5) Remove the chips and pat dry gently with a paper towel6) Weigh each group again and record your results.7) Calculate the % change in mass for each group.8) Use the results to make a calibration curve, showing % change in mass against sucrose concentrationThe potato chips will gain water (and therefore mass) in solutions with a higher water potentialthan the chips, and lose water in solutions with a lower water potential.The point at which the curve crosses the x-axis (where the % change in mass is 0) is the point at which the waterpotential of the sucrose solution is the same as the water potential of the potato cells.

Infectious diseases can be really nasty, but luckily there's an army of cells in the body that helps lo protect us \u2014 the immune system.Foreign Antigens Trigger an Immune ResponseAntigens are molecules (usually proteins) that can generate an immune response when clctected by the body.They arc usually found on the surface of cells and are used by the immune system to identify: pathogens (organisms that cause disease), abnormal body cells (e.g. cancerous or pathogen-infected cells, which have abnormal antigens on their surface), toxins and cells from other individuals of the same species (e.g. organ transplants).There are four main stages in the immune response:(T) Phagocytes Engulf PathogensA phagocyte (e.g. a macrophage) is a type of white blood cell that carries out phagocytosis (engulfment of pathogens). They're found in the blood and in tissues and are the first cells to respond to an immune system trigger inside the body. Here's how they work:1) A phagocyte recognises the foreign antigens on a pathogen.2) The cytoplasm of the phagocyte moves round the pathogen, engulfing it.3) The pathogen is now contained in a phagocytic vacuole (a bubble) in the cytoplasm of the phagocyte.4) A lysosome (an organelle that contain enzymes called lysozymes) fuses with the phagocytic vacuole. The lysozymes break down the pathogen.5) The phagocyte then presents the pathogen's antigens \u2014 it sticks the antigens on its surface to activate other immune system cells.nucleuscytoplasmlysosomeantigens on surface ofphagocyte engulfs the pathogenlysosome fuses with phagocytic vacuole(2) Phagocytes Activate T-cellsA T-cell {also called a T-lymphocyte) is another type of white blood cell. It has receptor proteins on its surface that bind to complementary antigens presented to it by phagocytes. This activates the T-cell. Different types of T-cells respond in different ways. For example, helper T-cells {TH cells) release chemical signals that activate and stimulate phagocytes and cytotoxic T-cells (Tc cells), which kill abnormal and foreign cells B-cells, which secrete antibodies (see below).Th cells also activate(3) T-cells Activate B-cells, Which Divide into Plasma CellsB-cells (also called B-lymphocytes) are also a type of white blood cell. They're covered with antibodies \u2014 proteins that bind antigens to form an antigen-antibody complex. Each B-cell has a different shaped antibody on its membrane, so different ones bind to different shaped antigens.1) When the antibody on the surface of a B-cell meets a complementary shaped antigen, it binds to it.2) This, together with substances released from helper T-cells, activates the B-cell. This process is called clonal selection.3) The activated B-cell divides into plasma cells.(V) Plasma Cells Make More Antibodies to a Specific AntigenPlasma cells are identical to the B-cell (they're clones). They secrete loads of antibodies specific to the antigen. These are called monoclonal antibodies. They bind to the antigens on the surface of the pathogen to form lots of antigen-antibody complexes,An antibody has two binding sites, so can bind to two pathogens at the same time. This means that pathogens become clumped together \u2014 this is called agglutination. Phagocytes then bind to the antibodies and phagocytose many pathogens at once. This process leads to the destruction of pathogens carrying this antigen in the body.variableregions(orange)constan regions (blue)heavychainAntibodies are proteins \u2014 they're made up of chains of amino acids.The specificity of an antibody depends on its variable regions, which form the antigen binding sites. Each antibody has a variable region with a unique tertiary structure {due to different amino acid sequences) that's complementary to one specific antigen. All antibodies have the same constant regions.Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n45The Immune SystemThe Immune Response Can be Split into Cellular and HumoralJust to add to your fun, the immune response is split into two \u2014 the cellular response and the humoral response.1) Cellular \u2014 The T-cells and other immune system cells that they interact with, e.g. phagocytes, form the cellular response.2) Humoral \u2014 B-cells, clonal selection and the production of monoclonal antibodies form the humoral response.Both types of response are needed to remove a pathogen from the body and the responses interact with each other, e.g. T-cells help to activate B-cells, and antibodies coat pathogens making it easier for phagocytes to engulf them.The Immune Response for Antigens can be MemorisedThe Primary Immune ResponseNeil's primary response \u2014 to his parents.1) When an antigen enters the body for the first time it activates the immune system. This is called the primary response.2) The primary response is slow because there aren't many B-cells that can make the antibody needed to bind to it.3) Eventually the body will produce enough of the right antibody to overcome the infection. Meanwhile the infected person will show symptoms of the disease.4) After being exposed to an antigen, both T- and B-cells produce memory cells. These memory cells remain in the body for a long time. Memory T-cells remember the specific antigen and will recognise it a second time round. Memory B-cells record the specific antibodies needed to bind the antigen.5) The person is now immune \u2014 their immune system has the ability to respond quickly to a second infection.The Secondary Immune Response1)2)3)If the same pathogen enters the body again,the immune system will produce a quicker, strongerimmune response \u2014 the secondary response.Clonal selection happens faster. Memory B-cells areactivated and divide into plasma cells that produce the right antibody to the antigen. Memory T-cells are activated and divide into the correct type of T-cells to kill the cell carrying the antigen.The secondary response often gets rid of the pathogen before you begin to show any symptoms (you are immune to the pathogen).Practice QuestionsQ1 What are antigens?Q2 What does the humoral response involve?

They just hang around a lot longer than most T-cells and B-cells. When the antigen enters the body for a second time they can immediately divide into more of the specific T-cells and B-cells that can kill the pathogen or release antibodies against it.Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","21":"46Immunity and VaccinesThe primary response gives us immunity against a disease, but only after you've become infected. If only there was a way to stimulate memory cell production without getting the disease... well, there is \u2014 vaccination.Vaccines can Protect Individuals and Populations Against Disease1) While your B-cells are busy dividing to build up their numbers to deal with a pathogen (i.e. the primary response \u2014 see previous page), you suffer from the disease. Vaccination can help avoid this.2) Vaccines contain antigens that cause your body to produce memory cells against a particular pathogen, without the pathogen causing disease. This means you become immune without getting any symptoms.3) Vaccines protect individuals that have them and, because they reduce the occurrence of the disease, those not vaccinated are also less likely to catch the disease (because there are fewer people to catch it from). This is called herd immunity.4) Vaccines always contain antigens \u2014 these may be free or attached to a dead or attenuated (weakened) pathogen.5) Vaccines may be injected or taken orally. The disadvantages of taking a vaccine orally are that it could be broken down by enzymes in the gut or the molecules of the vaccine may be too large to be absorbed into the blood.6) Sometimes booster vaccines are given later on (e.g. after several years) to make sure that memory cells are produced.Antigenic Variation Helps Some Pathogens Evade the Immune System1) Antigens on the surface of pathogens activate the primary response.2) When you're infected a second time with the same pathogen (which has the same antigens on its surface) they activate the secondary response and you don't get ill.3) However, some sneaky pathogens can change their surface antigens. This antigen variability is called antigenic variation. (Different antigens are formed due to changes in the genes of a pathogen.)4) This means that when you're infected for a second time, the memory cells produced from the first infection will not recognise the different antigens. So the immune system has to start from scratch and carry out a primary response against these new antigens.5) This primary response takes time to get rid of the infection, which is why you get ill again.6) Antigenic variation also makes it difficult to develop vaccines against some pathogens for the same reason. Examples of pathogens that show antigenic variation include HIV and the influenza virus.7) Here's how antigenic variation affects the production of vaccines to help prevent people catching influenza:1) The influenza (flu) vaccine changes every year. That's because the antigens on the surface of the influenza virus change regularly, forming new strains of the virus.2) Memory cells produced from vaccination with one strain of the flu will not recognise other strains with different antigens. The strains are immunologically distinct.3) Every year there are different strains of the influenza virus circulating in the population, so a different vaccine has to be made.4) New vaccines are developed and one is chosen every year that is the most effective against the recently circulating influenza viruses.5) Governments and health authorities then implement a programme of vaccination using the most suitable vaccine.1st infection\n2nd infectiondifferent antigensThe oral vaccine was proving hard to swallow.\nTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n47Immunity and VaccinesImmunity can be Active or PassiveACTIVE IMMUNITYThis is the type of immunity you get when your immune system makes its own antibodies after being stimulated by an antigen. There are two different types of active immunity:1) Natural \u2014 this is when you become immune after catching a disease.2) Artificial \u2014 this is when you become immune after you've been given a vaccination containing a harmless dose of antigen.PASSIVE IMMUNITYThis is the type of immunity you get from being given antibodies made by a different organism\u2014 your immune system doesn't produce any antibodies of its own. Again, there are two types:1) Natural \u2014 this is when a baby becomes immune due to the antibodies it receives from its mother, through the placenta and in breast milk.2) Artificial \u2014 this is when you become immune after being injected with antibodies from someone else. E.g. If you contract tetanus you can be injected with antibodies against the tetanus toxin, collected from blood donations.Active and Passive Immunity Have Contrasting CharacteristicsIn the exam you might be asked about the differences between these types of immunity:Active immunityPassive immunityRequires exposure to antigenDoesn't require exposure to antigenIt takes a while for protection to developProtection is immediateMemory cells are producedMemory cells aren't producedProtection is long-term because the antibody is produced (after activation of memory cells) in response to complementary antigen being present in the bodyProtection is short-term because the antibodies given are broken downPractice QuestionsQ1 How do vaccines cause immunity?Q2 Explain what antigenic variability is.Exam QuestionsQ1 Vaccines can be used to protect people against some diseases.

Explain why it is possible to suffer from the flu more than once.Q3 Immunity from a disease can be either active or passive.a) Explain why active immunity offers long-term protection against a disease, whereas passive immunity only offers protection in the short-term.b) It normally takes 14 days for immunity to develop after receiving a vaccine.Explain why vaccines do not usually offer immediate protection against a disease.An injection of dead bugs \u2014 roll on mv next vaccine...The influenza virus is so clever that it would almost make you think it had a mind of its own. I mean, as soon as we catch up with it and develop a vaccine, off it goes and changes its surface antigens again. Influenza virus: one, humans: nil. This is one of the ways viruses have evolved to avoid your immune system.

Let's all give three cheers for antibodies. Without them, we'd all probably be dead by now.Monoclonal Antibodies can be used to Target Specific Substances or Cells1) Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies produced from a single group of genetically identical B-cells(plasma cells). This means that they're all identical in structure.2) As you know, antibodies are very specific because their binding sites have a unique tertiary structure (see p.44) that only one particular antigen will fit into (one with a complementary shape).3) You can make monoclonal antibodies that bind to anything you want, e.g. a cell antigen or other substance, and they will only bind to (target) this molecule.EXAMPLE: Targeting drugs to a particular cell type \u2014 cancer cells1) Different cells in the body have different surface antigens.2) Cancer cells have antigens called tumour markers that are not found on normal body cells.3) Monoclonal antibodies can be made that will bind to the tumour markers.4) You can also attach anti-cancer drugs to the antibodies.5) When the antibodies come into contact with the canccr cells they will bind to the tumour markers.6) This means the drug will only accumulate in the body where there are cancer cells.7) So, the side effects of an antibody-based drug are lower than other drugs because they accumulate near specific cells.monoclonalantibodyantigen binding siteanti-cancer drugdrug attached to antibodyantibody binds to tumour markers on cancer cellcell-surface antigen\/\\----------------------------No0No------------------------------------------------------------\u2014L\nnormal body cell tumour marker cancer cellEXAMPLE: Targeting a particular substance for medical diagnosis \u2014 pregnancy testingPregnancy tests detect the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) that's found in the urine of pregnant women:1) The application area contains antibodies for hCG bound to a coloured bead (blue).2) When urine is applied to the application area any hCG will bind to the antibody on the beads, forming an antigen-antibody complex.3) The urine moves up the stick to the test strip, carrying any beads with it.4) The test strip contains antibodies to hCG that are stuck in place (immobilised).5) If there is hCG present the test strip turns blue because the immobilised antibody binds to any hCG \u2014 concentrating the hCG-antibody complex with the blue beads attached.If no hCG is present, the beads will pass through the test area without binding to anything, and so it won't go blue.coloured bead antibody \u00a9 ^ to hCGhCG\nappflow of liquidIimmobilised antibody to hCGication areatest stripTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n49Antibodies in MedicineThe ELISA Test is a Medical Diagnostic Test that Uses Antibodies1) The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) allows you to see if a patient has any antibodies to a certain antigen (see example below) or any antigen to a certain antibody.2) It can be used to test for pathogenic infections, for allergies (e.g. to nuts or lactose) and for just about anything you can make an antibody for.3) In an ELISA test, an antibody is used which has an enzyme attached to it. This enzyme can react with asubstrate to produce a coloured product. This causes the solution in the reaction vessel to change colour.4) If there's a colour change, it demonstrates that the antigen or antibody of interest is present in the sample being tested (e.g. blood plasma). In some types of ELISA, the quantity of this antigen\/antibody can be worked out from the intensity of the colour change.5) There are several different types of ELISA. Direct ELISA uses a single antibody that is complementary to the antigen you're testing for. Indirect ELISA is different because it uses two different antibodies.This method is outlined below:EXAMPLE: Using an ELISA as a HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) TestAn indirect ELISA test can be used to see if a patient possesses antibodies to the HIV virus:0 HIV antigen is bound to the bottom of a well in a well plate (a plastic tray with loads of little circular pits in it).\u00a9 A sample of the patient's blood plasma, which might contain several different antibodies, is added to the well.If there are any HIV-specific antibodies (i.e. antibodies against HIV) these will bind to the HIV antigen stuck to the bottom of the well. The well is then washed out to remove any unbound antibodies.(3) A secondary antibody, that has a specific enzyme attached to it, is added to the well.This secondary antibody can bind to the HIV-specific antibody (which is also called the primary antibody).The well is washed out again to remove any unbound secondary antibody. If there's no primary antibody in the sample, all of the secondary antibody will be washed away.(?) A solution is added to the well. This solution contains a substrate, which is able to react with the enzyme attached to the secondary antibody and produce a coloured product. If the solution changes colour, it indicates that the patient has HIV-specific antibodies in their blood and is infected with HIV.antibody specific to HIV antigenantibody not specific to HIV antigenHIVantigensecondary antibody with attached enzymecolour change = HIV is present (positive result)wash out 1= 0vXwash out(T) HIV antigen bound to bottom of the well(2) plasma sample added@ secondary antibody added(J) substrate addeds\\l I II II II II II I I I II I I I I i M II 11 \\ I I I I I I I I I I i H I I II M I II i II I I I I I I I i it I I\/, ~ The washing steps are important to make sure unbound antibodies aren't left in 3 5 the well which could affect the results.

They're not even living things \u2014 they can only reproduce inside the cells of another organism (called the host). All viruses cause disease, and you need to know all about one particularly nasty blighter...HIV is the Virus That Causes AIDS1) HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that affects the immune system.It eventually leads to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).2) AIDS is a condition where the immune system deteriorates and eventually fails. This makes someone with AIDS more vulnerable to other infections, like pneumonia (see next page).3) HIV infects (and eventually kills) helperT-cells, which act as the host cells (see p. 28) for the virus. Remember, helper T-cells send chemical signals that activate phagocytes, cytotoxic T-cells and B-cells (see p. 44) so they're hugely important cells in the immune response. Without enough helper T-cells, the immune system is unable to mount an effective response to infections because other immune system cells don't behave how they should.4) People infected with HIV develop AIDS when the helper T-cell numbers in their body reach a critically low level.HIV has a Spherical StructureYou might get asked about the structure of HIV in your exam1) A core that contains the genetic material (RNA) and some proteins (including the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is needed for virus replication).2) An outer coating of protein called a capsid.3) An extra outer layer called an envelope. This is made of membrane stolen from the cell membrane of a previous host cell.4) Sticking out from the envelope are loads of copies of an attachment protein that help HIV attach to thehost helper T-cell.HIV Replicates Inside its Host\u2019s Helper T-CellsHIV (and all other viruses) can only reproduce inside the cells of the organism it has infected. HIV replicates inside the helper T-cells of the host. It doesn't have the equipment (such as enzymes and ribosomes) to replicate on its own, so it uses those of the host cell.Here's how HIV replicates:1) The attachment protein attaches to a receptor molecule on the cell membrane of the host helper T-cell.2) The capsid is released into the cell, where it uncoats and releases the genetic material (RNA) into the cell's cytoplasm.3) Inside the cell, reverse transcriptase is used to make a complementary strand of DNA from the viral RNA template (see p. 16-17 for more on DNA and RNA).4) From this, double-stranded DNA is made and inserted into the human DNA.5) Host cell enzymes are used to make viral proteins from theviral DNA found within the human DNA.6) The viral proteins are assembled into new viruses, which bud from the cell and go on to infect other cells.During the initial infection period, HIV replicates rapidly and the infected person may experience severe flu-likesymptoms. After this period, HIV replication drops to a lower level. This is the latency period. During the latency period (which can last for years), the infected person won't experience any symptoms.Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\u00a9HIVhelper T cellDNA\u00a9\u00aev \u201c \u201c  DAttachment protein CapsidS1 , \" \"........................u-n,,,,,._ ttachnient proteins can also -EnvelopeGeneticmaterialReverse transcriptase\n53HIV and VirusesPeople with AIDS are Susceptible to a Range of IllnessesPeople with HIV are classed as having AIDS when symptoms of their failing immune system start to appear or their helper T-cell count drops below a certain level. People with AIDS generally develop diseases that wouldn't cause serious problems in people with a healthy immune system. The length of time between infection with HIV and the development of AIDS varies between individuals but without treatment it's usually around 10 years.1) The initial symptoms of AIDS include minor infections of mucous membranes (e.g. the inside of the nose, ears and genitals), and recurring respiratory infections.2) As AIDS progresses the number of immune system cells decreases further.Patients become susceptible to more serious infections including chronic diarrhoea, severe bacterial infections and tuberculosis.3) During the late stages of AIDS patients have a very low number of immune system cells and can develop a range of serious infections such as toxoplasmosis of the brain (a parasite infection) and candidiasis of the respiratory system (fungal infection). It's these serious infections that kill AIDS patients, not HIV itself.M r11\" M 1,1 \"ii\/- ^ infections become -Z m\u00b0J and \u2122ore serious = r 93 there are fewer and - mmune system ~\u00ab!'s to them.

Factors that affect progression of HIV to AIDS and survival time with AIDS include existing infections, the strain of HIV they're infected with, age and access to healthcare.Antibiotics Don\u2019t Work Against Viruses1) Antibiotics kill bacteria by interfering with their metabolic reactions.They target the bacterial enzymes and ribosomes used in these reactions.2) Bacterial enzymes and ribosomes are different from human enzymes and ribosomes. Antibiotics are designed to only target the bacterial ones so they don't damage human cells. Makes sense.3) Viruses don't have their own enzymes and ribosomes \u2014 they use the ones in the host's cells. So becausehuman viruses use human enzymes and ribosomes to replicate, antibiotics can't inhibit them because theydon't target human processes.4) Most antiviral drugs are designed to target the few virus-specific enzymes (enzymes that only the virus uses) that exist. For example, HIV uses reverse transcriptase to replicate (see previous page). Human cells don't use this enzyme so drugs can be designed to inhibit it without affecting the host cell. These drugs are called reverse-transcriptase inhibitors.There\u2019s No Cure for HIV1) There's currently no cure or vaccine for HIV but antiviral drugs can be used to slow down the progression of HIV infection and AIDS in an infected person.2) The best way to control HIV infection in a population is by reducing its spread. HIV can be spread via unprotected sexual intercourse, through infected bodily fluids (e.g. like blood from sharing contaminated needles) and from a HIV-positive mother to her fetus. Not all babies from HIV-positive mothers are born infected with HIV and taking antiviral drugs during pregnancy can reduce the chance of the baby being HIV-positive.Practice Questions- V testing, based on HIV '- anybody detection, before a =- baby is 18 months old can be \u00a3 \u00a3 inaccurate.

The diffusion rate is quick because of the small distances the substances have to travel (see p. 39).2) In multicellular animals, diffusion across the outer membrane is too slow, for two reasons:\u2022 Some cells are deep within the body \u2014 there's a big distance between them and the outside environment.\u2022 Larger animals have a low surface area to volume ratio \u2014 it's difficult to exchange enough substances to supply a large volume of animal through a relatively small outer surface.So rather than using straightforward diffusion to absorb and excrete substances, multicellular animals need specialised exchange organs (like lungs \u2014 see p. 58).They also need an efficient system to carry substances to and from their individual cells \u2014 this is mass transport.In mammals, 'mass transport' normally refers to the circulatory system (see p. 70), which uses blood to carry glucose and oxygen around the body. It also carries hormones, antibodies (p. 44) and waste like CO,.Mass transport in plants involves the transport of water and solutes in the xylem and phloem (see pages 78 and 80).Topic 3 A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n55Size and Surface AreaBody Size and Shape Affect Heat ExchangeAs well as creating waste products that need to be transported away, the metabolic activity inside cells creates heat. Staying at the right temperature is difficult, and it's pretty heavily influenced by your size and shape...SizeThe rate of heat loss from an organism depends on its surface area. If an organism has a large volume, e.g. a hippo, its surface area is relatively small. This makes it harder for it to lose heat from its body. If an organism is small, e.g. a mouse, its relative surface area is large, so heat is lost more easily. This means smaller organisms need a relatively high metabolic rate, in order to generate enough heat to stay warm.Shape1) Animals with a compact shape have a small surface area relative to their volume\u2014 minimising heat loss from their surface.2) Animals with a less compact shape (those that are a bit gangly or have sticky outy bits) have a larger surface area relative to their volume \u2014 this increases heat loss from their surface.3) Whether an animal is compact or not depends on the temperature of its environment. Here's an example:Arctic fox Body temperature 37 \u00b0C Average outside temperature O \u00b0C\u2022X*The Arctic fox has small ears and a round head to reduceits SA : V ratio and heat loss.African bat-eared fox Body temperature 37 \u00b0C Average outside temperature 25 \u00b0CThe African bat-eared fox has large ears and a more pointed nose to increase its SA : V ratio and heat loss.European fox Body temperature 37 \u00b0C Average outside temperature 12 \u00b0Ct* 4The European fox is intermediate between the two, matching the temperature of its environment.Organisms have Behavioural and Physiological Adaptations to Aid ExchangeNot all organisms have a body size or shape to suit their climate \u2014 some have other adaptations instead...1) Animals with a high SA : volume ratio tend to lose more water as it evaporates from their surface.Some small desert mammals have kidney structure adaptations so that they produce less urine to compensate.2) To support their high metabolic rates, small mammals living in cold regions need to eat large amounts of high energy foods such as seeds and nuts.3) Smaller mammals may have thick layers of fur or hibernate when the weather gets really cold.4) Larger organisms living in hot regions, e.g. elephants and hippos, find it hard to keep cool as their heat loss is relatively slow. Elephants have developed large flat ears to increase their surface area, allowing them to lose more heat. Hippos spend much of the day in the water \u2014 a behavioural adaptation to help them lose heat.Practice QuestionsQ1 Give four things that organisms need to exchange with their environment.Q2 Describe how body shape affects heat exchange.Exam QuestionQl Explain why a small mammal needs a relatively high metabolic rate compared to a large mammal.

This movement happens down a pressure gradient. Once in the alveoli, the oxygen diffuses across the alveolar epithelium, then the capillary endothelium,ending up in the capillary itself. This movement happens down a diffusion gradient.The Alveoli are Adapted for Gas ExchangeAlveoli have features that speed up the rate of diffusion so gases can be exchanged quickly:1) A thin exchange surface \u2014 the alveolar epithelium is only one cell thick. -\"see \" 11111\" 11This means there's a short diffusion pathway (which speeds up diffusion). : p\/9es and -- \" for more on ~2) A large surface area \u2014 the large number of alveoli means there's a large - diffusion ~surface area for gas exchange. 1\" 1' m i\/11There's also a steep concentration gradient of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the alveoli and the capillaries, which increases the rate of diffusion.

Well, here are some lovely dissections that you might do. How exciting.You Need to be Able to Carry Out Dissections1) As part of your AS or A level in Biology, you're expected to carry out at least one dissection. It could be a dissection of a gaseous exchange system or a mass transport system (or an organ within one of those systems) in either an animal or a plant. You could also be asked about dissections in your exams.2) There's an example of a plant dissection that you could do on page 79.These two pages cover some animal dissections that you could do as well or instead.3) Whether it's a plant or animal dissection, you're expected to know how to carry it out safely and ethically. You might also need to record your observations using labelled diagrams.You Can Dissect the Gaseous Exchange Systems of AnimalsLungs Can be Dissected To Show the Main Structuresi'111\"1 '111, n i \\i in i ,,i,_ \u00a3 You can learn more about r \u201c the lun1)2)3)4)5)6)3s on pages 58-59.First up, lung dissection is messy, so make sure you're wearing a lab coat. 111'\" '1'1 < \u0000 w i i, \/1 m i ,\/ v-Your dissecting tools (e.g. scalpels, dissecting scissors) should all be clean, sharp and free from rust \u2014 blunt tools don't cut well and can be dangerous.Lay the lungs your teacher has given you on a cutting board. They'll probably be sheep or pig lungs from a butcher's shop. You should be able to see the trachea and two bronchi going into the lungs.To see the lungs inflate, attach a piece of rubber tubing to the trachea and pump air into the lungs using a foot or bicycle pump. The lungs will deflate by themselves because of the elastin in the walls of the alveoli (see p. 61).Never blow down the tube to inflate the lungs \u2014 you could end up sucking up stale air from irside the lungs into your mouth.Pop the lungs in a clear plastic bag before you start to stop bacteria inside the lungs from being released into the room.Once you've seen the lungs inflate, you can examine the different tissue types in the lungs.The trachea is supported by C-shaped rings of cartilage. smooth muscleA cross-section of the trachea looks like this:C-shapedcartilageII I | I 1 \\ I I I M I III I I ' I M 1\/- If you do cut the - Z. cartilage be careful \u2014 you -- need to wear goggles to rprotect your eyes.\/| i \\ i H n 111 w M 111 M i7)8) 9)Cartilage is tough, so if you want to open up the trachea, it's best to cut it lengthways, down the gap in the C-shaped rings. Use dissecting scissors or a scalpel to make the cut. If using a scalpel, cut downwards (not towards you) and don't apply too much pressure to the blade.Continue cutting down one of the bronchi. You should be able to see the bronchioles branching off.Cut off a piece of the lung. The tissue will feel spongy because of the air trapped in all the alveoli.Lungs from a butcher are safe for humans to handle, but they could still contain bacteria that cause food poisoning. That's why it's important to wash your hands after the dissection and disinfect work surfaces.Here\u2019s How to Dissect Fish Gills in Bony Fish1) Again, make sure you're wearing an apron or lab coat.2) Place your chosen fish (something like a perch or salmon works well) in a dissection tray or on a cutting board.3) Gills are located on either side of the fish's head. They're protected on eachside by a bony flap called an operculum and supported by gill arches.4) To remove the gills, push back the operculum and use scissors to carefully remove the gills. Cut each gill arch through the bone at the top and bottom. They should look a bit like this:5) If you look closely, you should be able to see the gill filaments.N\\\/1 I II I i \/1 I I II I M I I II I II 11 u u 111 i ii I I II I M II I i u I II I II II n I I I I I I I I I 11^- For more nformation about the structure and function of fish gills, see page 56. - 1 w n 11 H ' i u 11 h 11 h 11111111 m i m i m 111 m 111 ii m i w i m 11 m w n ^A single gill archoperculum (the gills are under here)\ngill filamentsTopic 3 A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n65Dissecting Gas Exchange SystemsYou Can Dissect the Gaseous Exchange System in Insects tooBig insects like grasshoppers or cockroaches are usually best for dissecting because they're easier to handle.

You should be able to see a network of very thin, silvery-grey tubes \u2014 these are the tracheae. They look silver because they're filled with air.You can examine the tracheae under an optical microscope using a temporary mount slide (see p. 30). Again, the tracheae will appear silver or grey.

Here are some points to think about:1) Some people argue that it is morally wrong to kill animals just for dissections, as it is unnecessary killing. However many dissections that are carried out in schools involve animals that have already been killed for their meat, e.g. the sheep's lung dissection on the previous page. (Some people disagree with killing animals altogether though.)2) There are concerns that the animals used for dissections are not always raised in a humane way \u2014 they may be subject to overcrowding, extremes of temperature or lack of food \u2014 and they may not be killed humanely either. If animals (e.g. insects) are raised in school for dissection, it's important to make sure they are looked after properly and killed humanely to minimise any suffering or distress.Practice QuestionsQ1 Why is it important that dissecting tools are sharp?Q2 Describe how to remove the gills in a bony fish.Exam QuestionsQ1 A student is examining grasshopper tracheae under the microscope.

Dissections are all about cutting open organisms, so you can see everything you've been learning about and hopefully understand it better. You should be able to apply your knowledge of gas exchange systems (see pages 56-59) to any dissections you get asked about in the exams.Topic 3A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","28":"66 Topic 3BMore Exchange and Transport SystemsDigestion and AbsorptionThe whole point of digestion is to break down the food you eat into small molecules that your cells can absorb. As you might imagine, this involves loads of different chemical reactions and our old friends, enzymes.Food is Broken Down into Smaller Molecules During Digestion1) The large biological molecules (e.g. starch, proteins) in food are too big to cross cell membranes.This means they can't be absorbed from the gut into the blood.2) During digestion, these large molecules are broken down into smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, amino acids), which can move across cell membranes. This means they can be easily absorbed from the gut into the blood, to be transported around the body for use by the body cells.3) You might remember from Topic 1 A, that most large biological molecules are polymers, which can be broken down into smaller molecules (monomers) using hydrolysis reactions.Hydrolysis reactions break bonds by adding water.4) During hydrolysis, carbohydrates are broken down into disaccharides and then monosaccharides.Fats are broken down into fatty acids and monoglycerides. Proteins are broken down into amino acids.Digestive Enzymes are Used to Break Down Biological Molecules in Food1) A variety of different digestive enzymes are produced by specialised cells in the digestive systems of mammals. These enzymes are then released into the gut to mix with food.2) Since enzymes only work with specific substrates (see page 11), different enzymes are needed to catalyse the breakdown of different food molecules.Carbohydrates are Broken Down by Amylase and Membrane-Bound Disaccharidases1) Amylase is a digestive enzyme that catalyses the conversion of starch (a polysaccharide) into the smaller sugar maltose (a disaccharide). This involves the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds in starch.2) Amylase is produced by the salivary glands (which release amylase into the mouth) and also by the pancreas (which releases amylase into the small intestine).3) Membrane-bound disaccharidases are enzymes that are attached to the cell membranes of epithelial cellslining the ileum (the final part of the small intestine). They help to break down disaccharides (e.g. maltose, sucrose and lactose) into monosaccharides (e.g. glucose, fructose and galactose). Again, this involves the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds.<v\\u i \" i J1111111111 \/ I i, l I I I 11111,~ There s more on polysaccharides, tl ~ disaccharides and monosaccharides \u2014- on pages 2-5. \"\/> 111111' 11 n w i \/ it 1111111111 n4) Monosaccharides can be transported across the cell membranes of the ileum epithelial cells via specific transporter proteins (see next page).DisaccharideDisaccharidaseMonosaccharide Productsmaltosemaltaseglucose + glucosesucrosesucraseglucose + fructoselactoselactaseglucose + galactoseLipids are Broken Down by Lipase (with the Help of Bile Salts)1) Lipase enzymes catalyse the breakdown of lipids into monoglycerides and fatty acids. This involves the hydrolysis of the ester bonds in lipids.2) Lipases are made in the pancreas. They work in the small intestine.3) Bile salts are produced by the liver and emulsify lipids \u2014 this means they cause the lipids to form small droplets.4) Bile salts are really important in the process of lipid digestion. Several small lipid droplets have a bigger surface area than a single large droplet (for the same volume of lipid). So the formation of small droplets greatly increases the surface area of lipid that's available for lipases to work on.\u00a3 monoglyceride is a C- glycerol molecule with \u00a3 ~ one fatty acid attached =\nemulsificationbile saltsbiglipid dropletA \/V,\/ lipase digestion\u00b0o\u00b0of lipidsmall lipid dropletsmonoglycerides & fatty acids \u00b00\u00b0\u00b00 micelles5) Once the lipid has been broken down, the monoglycerides and fatty acids stick with the bile salts to form tiny structures called micelles.Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n67Digestion and AbsorptionProteins are Broken Down by Endopeptidases and ExopeptidasesProteins are broken down by a combination of different proteases (or peptidases). These are enzymes that catalyse the conversion of proteins into amino acids by hydrolysing the peptide bonds between amino acids.You need to know about endopeptidases and exopeptidases (including dipeptidases):Endopeptidases act to hydrolyse peptide bonds within a protein. '' L11111!'''11 ['11111' n 11 it-r ^ \u2019 7 r r 1 r Remember: endopeptidases -Trypsin and chymotrypsin are two examples of endopeptidases. r break bonds inside the protein -They're synthesised in the pancreas and secreted into the small intestine. M 111111' i nm1 < m 111, n i ifPepsin is another endopeptidase. It's released into the stomach by cells in the stomach lining.Pepsin only works in acidic conditions \u2014 these are provided by hydrochloric acid in the stomach.Exopeptidases act to hydrolyse peptide bonds at the ends of protein molecules.They remove single amino acids from proteins.Dipeptidases are exopeptidases that work specifically on dipeptides. They act to separate the two amino acids that make up a dipeptide by hydrolysing the peptide bond between them.Dipeptidases are often located in the cell-surface membrane of epithelial cells in the small intestine.The Products of Digestion are Absorbed Across Cell MembranesThe products of digestion are absorbed across the ileum epithelium into the bloodstream.Monosaccharides\u2022 Glucose is absorbed by active transport with sodium ions via a co-transporter protein(see page 43). Galactose is absorbed in the same way using the same co-transporter protein.\u2022 Fructose is absorbed via facilitated diffusion through a different transporter protein.Monoglycerides and fatty acidsMicelles (see previous page) help to move monoglycerides and fatty acids towards the epithelium. Because micelles constantly break up and reform they can 'release' monoglycerides and fatty acids, allowing them to be absorbed \u2014 whole micelles are not taken up across the epithelium. Monoglycerides and fatty acids are lipid-soluble, so can diffuse directly across the epithelial cell membrane.Amino acidsAmino acids are absorbed in a similar way to glucose and galactose. Sodium ions are actively transported out of the epithelial cells into the ileum itself. They then diffuse back into the cells through sodium-dependent transporter proteins in the epithelial cell membranes, carrying the amino acids with them.Practice QuestionsQ1 What is the function of amylase in digestion?Q2 Describe the role of bile salts in lipid digestion.Exam QuestionQ1 Some people suffer from lactose intolerance.This can be caused by an inability to break down lactose in the upper small intestine.a) Suggest which disaccharidase enzyme is deficient or missing in people who are lactose-intolerant. [1 mark]b) How are the digestion products of lactose absorbed across the epithelial cells of the ileum? [2 marks]Crikey, this all looks a bit tricky to digest... belch...Don't panic. There's a lot to take in here but as long as you break it clown a bit (ha, just like digestion) then it's not too bad. You can't escape learning what all the enzymes act on, but helpfully their names are usually linked to what they do \u2014 maltase breaks down maltose, dipeptidases break down dipeptides. See, it's not as bad as it looks...Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n","29":"68HaemoglobinHaemoglobin's a protein that carries oxygen around the body.

As well as being found in all vertebrates, haemoglobin is found in earthworms, starfish, some insects, some plants and even in some bacteria.Haemoglobin Saturation Depends on the Partial Pressure of Oxygen1) The partial pressure of oxygen (p02) is a measure of oxygen concentration.The greater the concentration of dissolved oxygen in cells, the higher the partial pressure.2) Similarly, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pC02) is a measure of the concentration of CO, in a cell.3) Haemoglobin's affinity for oxygen varies depending on the partial pressure of oxygen:Oxygen loads onto haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin where there's a hi;Oxyhaemoglobin unloads its oxygen where there's a lower p02.4) Oxygen enters blood capillaries at the alveoli in the lungs. Alveoli have a high p02 so oxygen loads onto haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin.5) When cells respire, they use up oxygen \u2014 this lowers the pOr Red blood cells deliver oxyhaemoglobin to respiring tissues, where it unloads its oxygen6) The haemoglobin then returns to the lungs to pick up more oxygen.There was no use pretending \u2014 the partial pressure of CH., had just increased, and Keith knew who was to blame.Dissociation Curves Show How Affinity for Oxygen VariesA dissociation curve shows how saturated the haemoglobin is with oxygen at any given partial pressure.slll I I M M I III W I I I I I I II I \/\/,- 100% saturation means C- every haemoglobin molecule f~ is carrying the maximum -- of 4 molecules of oxygen. \u2014'\/1 I II I I M I II II M J 1 I II I I I IX\\U I I I II H I I I M I II M I I I M I l\/y- 0% saturation means none 3r of the haemoglobin molecules 5are carrying any oxygen. -\"'n I I M I i w I I I I II II 11 n I I 11The graph is 'S-shaped' because when haemoglobin (Hb) combines with the first 02 molecule, its shape alters in a way that makes it easier for other molecules to join too. But as the Hb starts to become saturated, it gets harder for more oxygen molecules to join. As a result, the curve has a steep bit in the middle where it's really easy for oxygen molecules to join, and shallow bits at each end where it's harder.

That's why it has a low saturation of oxygen.\nTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n69HaemoglobinCarbon Dioxide Concentration Affects Oxygen UnloadingTo complicate matters, haemoglobin gives up its oxygen more readily at higher partial pressures of carbon dioxide (pC02).It's a cunning way of getting more oxygen to cells during activity. \u00a7ku- x1) When cells respire they produce carbon dioxide, \u00b0 ^which raises the pCOr % *2) This increases the rate of oxygen unloading (i.e. the rate Jj ^at which oxyhaemoglobin dissociates to form haemoglobin ^and oxygen) \u2014 so the dissociation curve 'shifts' right.The saturation of blood with oxygen is lower for a given p02, meaning that more oxygen is being released.3) This is called the Bohr effect.Haemoglobin is Different in Different OrganismsDifferent organisms have different types of haemoglobin with different oxygen transporting capacities. Having a particular type of haemoglobin is an adaptation that helps the organism to survive in a particular environment.1) Organisms that live in environments with a low concentration of oxygen have haemoglobin with a higher affinity for oxygen than human haemoglobin \u2014 the dissociation curve is to the left of ours.2) Organisms that are very active and have a high oxygen demand have haemoglobin with a lower affinity for oxygen than human haemoglobin \u2014 the curve is to the right of the human one.A = animal living in depleted oxygen environment, e.g. a lugworm.B = animal living at high altitude where the partial pressure ofoxygen is lower, e.g. a llama in the Andes.C = human dissociation curve.D = active animal with a high respiratory rate living where there's plenty of available oxygen, e.g. a hawk.of oxygen \/ kPaPractice QuestionsQ1 How many oxygen molecules can each haemoglobin molecule carry?Q2 Where in the body would you find a low partial pressure of oxygen?Q3 Why are oxygen dissociation curves S-shaped?Exam QuestionQI a) Haemoglobin is a protein with a quaternary structure.Explain what this means.

Most multicellular organisms (mammals, insects, fish) have a circulatory system of some type.The Circulatory System is a Mass Transport System1) Multicellular organisms, like mammals, have a low surface area to volume ratio (see p. 54), so they need a specialised transport system to carry raw materials from specialised exchange organs to their body cells \u2014 this is the circulatory system.2) The circulatory system is made up of the heart and blood vessels.3) The heart pumps blood through blood vessels (arteries,arterioles, veins and capillaries) to reach different parts of the body. You need to know the names of all the bloodvessels entering and leaving the heart, lungs and kidneys.-4) Blood transports respiratory gases, products of digestion, metabolic wastes and hormones round the body.There are two circuits.One circuit takes blood from the heart to the lungs, then back to the heart.The other loop takes blood around the rest of the body.

The inner lining (endothelium) is folded, allowing the artery to stretch \u2014 this also helps it to maintain high pressure.

Veins contain valves to stop the blood flowing backwards. Blood flow through the veins is helped by contraction of the body muscles surrounding them. All veins carry deoxygenated blood (because oxygen has been used up by body cells), except for the pulmonary veins, which carry oxygenated blood to the heart from the lungs.Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n77The Circulatory SystemSubstances are Exchanged between Blood and Body Tissues at CapillariesArterioles branch into capillaries, which are the smallest of the blood vessels. Substances (e.g. glucose and oxygen) are exchanged between cells and capillaries, so they're adapted for efficient diffusion.1) They're always found very near cells in exchange tissues (e.g. alveoli in the lungs), so there's a short diffusion pathway.2) Their walls are only one cell thick, which also shortens the diffusion pathway.3) There are a large number of capillaries, to increase surface area for, n k) exchange. Networks of capillaries in tissue are called capillary beds.Tissue Fluid is Formed from BloodTissue fluid is the fluid that surrounds cells in tissues. It's made from small molecules that leave the blood plasma, e.g. oxygen, water and nutrients. (Unlike blood, tissue fluid doesn't contain red blood cells or big proteins, because they're too large to be pushed out through the capillary walls.) Cells take in oxygen and nutrients from the tissue fluid, and release metabolic waste into it. In a capillary bed, substances move out of the capillaries, into the tissue fluid, by pressure filtration:1) At the start of the capillary bed, nearest the arteries, the hydrostatic (liquid) pressure inside the capillaries is greater than the hydrostatic pressure in the tissue fluid.2) This difference in hydrostatic pressure means an overall outward pressure forces fluid out of the capillaries and into the spaces around the cells, forming tissue fluid.3) As fluid leaves, the hydrostatic pressure reduces in the capillaries\u2014 so the hydrostatic pressure is much lower at the venule end of the capillary bed (the end that's nearest to the veins).4) Due to the fluid loss, and an increasing concentration of plasma proteins (which don't leave the capillaries), the water potential at the venule end of the capillary bed is lower than the water potential in the tissue fluid.5) This means that some water re-enters the capillaries from the tissue fluid at the venule end by osmosis (see p. 40 for more on osmosis).Blood ___!from arteriolecapillary bed\nwaterAny excess tissue fluid is drained into the lymphatic system(a network of tubes that acts a bit like a drain), which transports this excessfluid from the tissues and dumps it back into the circulatory system.Practice Questions11111\" 11111 n 111 m 111 a i \/\/\/- High blood pressure means a high :- hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries, -- which can lead to an accumulation 2 ^ of tissue fluid in the tissues.\" 111 n I I M I II I I | n I II I | I I i | | | m\\<\"Q1 Name all the blood vessels entering and leaving the heart.Q2 List four types of blood vessel.Q3 Explain why water returns to the capillary at the venule end of the capillary bed.Exam QuestionsQl Describe two structural features of an artery and explain how each feature relates to its function.[4 marks]Q2 At the arteriole end of a capillary bed the hydrostatic pressure is 5.1 kPa in a capillary and 0.13 kPa in the spacearound the cells.

There are certain factors that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.Most Cardiovascular Disease Starts with Atheroma Formationelastic tissue in wall1) The wall of an artery is made up of several layers (see p. 70).2) The endothelium (inner lining) is usually smooth and unbroken.3) If damage occurs to the endothelium (e.g. by high blood pressure) white blood cells (mostly macrophages) and lipids (fat) from the blood, clump together under the lining to form fatty streaks.4) Over time, more white blood cells, lipids and connective tissue build up and harden to form a fibrous plaque called an atheroma.5) This plaque partially blocks the lumen of the artery and restricts blood flow, which causes blood pressure to increase.6) Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a type of cardiovascular disease.It occurs when the coronary arteries have lots of atheromas in them, which restricts blood flow to the heart muscle. It can lead to myocardial infarction (see below).Atheromas Increase the Risk of Aneurysm and ThrombosisTwo types of disease that affect the arteries are:Aneurysm \u2014 a balloon-like swelling of the artery.1) Atheroma plaques damage and weaken arteries.They also narrow arteries, increasing blood pressure.2) When blood travels through a weakened artery at high pressure, it may push the inner layers of the artery through the outer elastic layer to form a balloon-like swelling \u2014 an aneurysm.3) This aneurysm may burst, causing a haemorrhage (bleeding).Thrombosis \u2014 formation of a blood clot.1) An atheroma plaque can rupture (burst through) the endothelium (inner lining) of an artery.2) This damages the artery wall and leaves a rough surface.3) Platelets and fibrin (a protein) accumulate at the site of damage and form a blood clot (a thrombus).4) This blood clot can cause a complete blockage of the artery, or it can become dislodged and block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body.5) Debris from the rupture can cause another blood clot to form further down the artery.Interrupted Blood Flow to the Heart can Cause a Myocardial Infarction1) The heart muscle is supplied with blood by the coronary arteries.2) This blood contains the oxygen needed by heart muscle cells to carry out respiration.3) If a coronary artery becomes completely blocked (e.g. by a blood clot) an area of the heart muscle will be totally cut off from its blood supply, receiving no oxygen.4) This causes a myocardial infarction \u2014 more commonly known as a heart attack.5) A heart attack can cause damage and death of the heart muscle.6) Symptoms include pain in the chest and upper body, shortness of breath and sweating.7) If large areas of the heart are affected complete heart failure can occur, which is often fatal.aneurysmnormal arterythick muscle* layerdeposits of fatty material, dead cells, white blood cells and connective tissuedeposits of fatty material etc. build up and push out endothelium to form an atheromalumen(space in centre)endothelium\nlumen shrinks as artery wall swells, so it's more difficult for blood to pass through\nTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n76Cardiovascular DiseaseSome Factors Increase the Risk of Cardiovascular DiseaseSome of the most common risk factors for cardiovascular disease are:High blood cholesterol and poor diet1) If the blood cholesterol level is high (above 240 mg per 100 cm3) then the risk of cardiovascular disease is increased.2) This is because cholesterol is one of the main constituents of the fatty deposits that form atheromas (see previous page).3) Atheromas can lead to increased blood pressure and blood clots.4) This could block the flow of blood to coronary arteries, which could cause a myocardial infarction (see previous page for details).5) A diet high in saturated fat is associated with high blood cholesterol levels.6) A diet high in salt also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease because it increases the risk of high blood pressure (see below).John decided to live on the edge and ordered a fry-up.G)Cigarette smoking1) Both nicotine and carbon monoxide, found in cigarette smoke, increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.2) Nicotine increases the risk of high blood pressure (see below).3) Carbon monoxide combines with haemoglobin and reduces the amount of oxygen transported in the blood, and so reduces the amount of oxygen available to tissues. If heart muscle doesn't receive enough oxygen it can lead to a heart attack(see previous page).4) Smoking also decreases the amount of antioxidants in the blood \u2014 these are important for protecting cells from damage. Fewer antioxidants means cell damage in the coronary artery walls is more likely, and this can lead to atheroma formation.High blood pressure1) High blood pressure increases the risk of damage to the artery walls.2) Damaged walls have an increased risk of atheroma formation, causing a further increase in blood pressure.3) Atheromas can also cause blood clots to form (see previous page).4) A blood clot could block flow of blood to the heart muscle, possibly resulting in myocardial infarction.5) So anything that increases blood pressure also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, e.g. being overweight, not exercising and excessive alcohol consumption.~ ^ther factors include age ' - (risk increases with age) ~ 5 and sex (men are more at E -v risk than women) - IW||VV\"Most of these factors are within our control \u2014 a person can choose to smoke, eat fatty foods, etc. However, some risk factors can't be controlled, such as having a genetic predisposition to coronary heart disease or having high blood pressure as a result of another condition, e.g. some forms of diabetes.

The difference is in their hydrocarbon tails (R group).Saturated fatty acids don't have any double bonds Unsaturated fatty acids have at least one double bondbetween their carbon atoms. The fatty acid is between carbon atoms, which cause the chain to kink.\nsaturated hydrocarbon tail unsaturated hydrocarbon tailPhospholipids are Similar to Triglycerides1) The lipids found in cell membranes aren't triglycerides\u2014 they're phospholipids.2) Phospholipids are pretty similar to triglycerides except one of the fatty acid molecules is replaced by a phosphate group.3) The phosphate group is hydrophilic (attracts water). The fatty acid tails are hydrophobic (repel water). This is important in the cell membrane (see next page to find out why).Structure of a Phospholipid\nTopic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n7LipidsThe Structures of Lipids Relate to Their FunctionsYou need to know how the structures of triglycerides and phospholipids are related to their functions:Triglycerides are mainly used as energy storage molecules. They're good for this because:1) The long hydrocarbon tails of the fatty acids contain lots of chemical energy\u2014 a load of energy is released when they're broken down. Because of these ^ CPtails, lipids contain about twice as much energy per gram as carbohydrates. q ^2) They're insoluble, so they don't affect the water potential (see p. 40) of r,the cell and cause water to enter the cells by osmosis (which would make them ^ ^swell). The triglycerides clump together as insoluble droplets in cells because ^ {\/the fatty acid tails are hydrophobic (water-repelling) \u2014 the tails face inwards, es &shielding themselves from water with their glycerol heads.Phospholipids make up the bilayer of cell membranes (see p. 36).Cell membranes control what enters and leaves a cell.1) Their heads are hydrophilic and their tails are hydrophobic, so they forma double layer with their heads facing out towards the water on either side.2) The centre of the bilayer is hydrophobic, so water-soluble substances can't easily pass through it \u2014 the membrane acts as a barrier to those substances.Use the Emulsion Test for LipidsIf you wanted to find out if there was any fat in aparticular food you could do the emulsion test:1) Shake the test substance with ethanol for about a minute so that it dissolves, then pour the solution into water.2) Any lipid will show up as a milky emulsion.3) The more lipid there is, the more noticeable the milky colour will be.Test substance and ethanolShakesAdd to waterMilky colour indicates lipidPractice QuestionsQ1 What type of bond is made from a condensation reaction between glycerol and a fatty acid molecule?Q2 Describe how you would test for lipids in a solution.Exam QuestionsQ1 Triglycerides have a hydrophobic tail.

This is because a large sample is more representative of the whole population (i.e. it shares more of the various characteristics of the population).>97.6 >115.4 >132.2-115.4 -132.2 -153.9 Level of LDL cholesterol in blood \/ mg dl'4111111111 m 1111 \/111111 ^ There's more on correlation z \u201c and cause on page 213. -^1 u 11 w 111111111 n 111; 111'>153.9\nYou might also have to evaluate conflicting evidence associated with risk factors affecting cardiovascular disease. E.g. one study might conclude that a factor isn't a health risk, whereas another study might conclude that the same factor is a health risk.1) If two studies have produced conflicting results, think about why that might be. Was it to do withstudy design? Was one study based on a small sample size? Did both studies take into accountother risk factors (variables) that could have affected the results?

When you consider the movement of water, it's all about the xylem. It's pretty exciting stuff...Two Types of Tissue are Involved in Transport in Plants1) Xylem tissue transports water and mineral ions in solution.These substances move up the plant from the roots to the leaves.2) Phloem tissue transports organic substances like sugars (also in solution) bothup and down the plant \u2014 there's more about the phloem on pages 80-81.3) Xylem and phloem are mass transport systems (see page 54) \u2014 they move substances over large distances.Xylem vessels are the part of the xylem tissue that actually transports the water and ions. Xylem vessels are very long, tube-like structures formed from dead cells (vessel elements) joined end to end. There are no end walls on these cells, making an uninterrupted tube that allows water to pass up through the middle easily.Xvlem Vesselcell \u00a3wallno end wallc between cells\u00bbtube that water moves throughWater Moves Up a Plant Against the Force of GravityCohesion and tension help water move up plants, from roots to leaves, against the force of gravity.1) Water evaporates from the leaves at the 'top' of the xylem (this is transpiration \u2014 see below).2) This creates tension (suction), which pulls more water into the leaf.3) Water molecules are cohesive (they stick together \u2014 see page 21)so when some are pulled into the leaf others follow. 111 n n 11 u n \/\/,This means the whole column of water in the xylem, \u00a3 \u201d^'s is calle<^ -from the leaves down to the roots, moves upwards. - c\u00b0 esion'tensiori -\u2014 theory of water -4) Water enters the stem through the roots. ~ transport. -n i1 ii 111 niii\\sTranspiration is Loss of Water from a Plant\u2019s SurfaceTranspiration is the evaporation of water from a plant's surface, especially the leaves.1) Water evaporates from the moist cell walls and accumulates in the spaces between cells in the leaf.2) When the stomata open (see page 57), it moves out of the leaf down the concentration gradient (there's more water inside the leaf than in the air outside).s.\"'\"n\"\"i i n II I\/(I,,,,,r Transpiration's really a side \u00a3 r effect of photosynthesis \u2014 ~- the plant needs to open its \u00a7 r stomata to let in CO, so E ~ that it can produce glucose, -- but this also lets water out. z ' 111 11 \/1111111 \/ \/111 |, n\\sFour Main Factors Affect Transpiration Rate1) Light \u2014 the lighter it is the faster the transpiration rate (i.e. there's a positive correlationbetween light intensity and transpiration rate). This is because the stomata open when it gets light to let in CO, for photosynthesis. When it's dark the stomata are usually closed, so there's little transpiration.2) Temperature \u2014 the higher the temperature the faster the transpiration rate. Warmer water molecules have more energy so they evaporate from the cells inside the leaf faster. This increases the concentration gradient between the inside and outside of the leaf, making water diffuse out of the leaf faster.3) Humidity \u2014 the lower the humidity, the faster the transpiration rate (i.e. there's a negative correlationbetween humidity and transpiration rate). If the air around the plant is dry, the concentration gradient between the leaf and the air is increased, which increases transpiration.4) Wind \u2014 the windier it is, the faster the transpiration rate. Lots of air movement blows away water molecules from around the stomata. This increases the concentration gradient, which increases the rate of transpiration.water evaporatestension<3 cohesiong) water enters\nTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n79Transport in Plants \u2014 XylemA Potometer can be Used to Estimate Transpiration RateA potometer is a special piece of apparatus used to estimate transpiration rates. It actually measures water uptake by a plant, but it's assumed that water uptake by the plant is directly related to water loss by the leaves. You can use it to estimate how different factors affect the transpiration rate.Here's what you'd do:Cut a shoot underwater to prevent air from entering the xylem. Cut it at a slant to increase the surface area available for water uptake.Assemble the potometer in water and insert the shoot underwater, so no air can enter.Remove the apparatus from the water but keep the end of the capillary tube submerged in a beaker of water. Check that the apparatus is watertight and airtight.Dry the leaves, allow time for the shoot to acclimatise, and then shut the tap.Remove the end of the capillary tube from the beaker of water until one air bubble has formed, then put the end of the tube back into the water.Record the starting position of the air bubble.Start a stopwatch and record the distance moved by the bubble per unit time, e.g. per hour. The rate of air bubble movement is an estimate of the transpiration rate.Remember, only change one variable (e.g. temperature) at a time. All other conditions (e.g. light, humidity) must be kept constant.You Might Have to Dissect PlantsYou can look at xylem or phloem in plant tissue (e.g. part of a plant stem) under a microscope, and then draw them. But first you need to dissect the plant and prepare a section of the tissue. You can do this using the following method:1) Use a scalpel (or razor blade) to cut a cross-section of the stem. Cut the sections as thinly as possible \u2014 thin sections are better for viewing under a microscope.2) Use tweezers to gently place the cut sections in water until you come to use them. This stops them from drying out.3) Transfer each section to a dish containing a stain, e.g. toluidine blue O (TBO), and leave for one minute. TBO stains the lignin in the walls of the xylem vessels blue-green.This will let you see the position of the xylem vessels and examine their structure.4) Rinse off the sections in water and mount each one onto a slide (see page 30).Practice QuestionsQ1 What is the function of xylem tissue?Q2 Give four factors that affect transpiration rate.Q3 Name a piece of apparatus used to measure transpiration rate.Exam QuestionQ1 a) What is meant by the term transpiration?

I know,; I almost can't contain my excitement. When it comes to the phloem it's all about moving dissolved organic substances around the plant, so it's a bit different to xylem.Phloem Tissue is Adapted for Transporting Solutes1) Solutes are dissolved substances. Phloem tissue transports solutes (mainly sugars like sucrose) round plants. Like xylem, phloem is formed from cells arranged in tubes.2) Sieve tube elements and companion cells are important cell types in phloem tissue:\u2022 Sieve tube elements are living cells that form the tube for transporting solutes. They have no nucleus and few organelles, so...\u2022 ...there's a companion cell for each sieve tube element. They carry out living functions for sieve cells, e.g. providing the energy needed for the active transport of solutes.Translocation is the Movement of Solutes1) Translocation is the movement of solutes (e.g. sugars like sucrose, and amino acids) to where they're needed in a plant. Solutes are sometimes called assimilates.2) It's an energy-requiring process that happens in the phloem.3) Translocation moves solutes from 'sources' to 'sinks'. The source of a solute is where it's made (so it's at a high concentration there). The sink is the area where it's used up (so it's at a lower concentration there).E.g. the source for sucrose is usually the leaves (where it's made), and the sinks are the other parts of the plant, especially the food storage organs and the meristems {areas of growth) in the roots, stems and leaves.4) Enzymes maintain a concentration gradient from the source to the sink by changing the solutes at the sink (e.g. by breaking them down or making them into something else). This makes sure there's always a lower concentration at the sink than at the source.E.g. in potatoes, sucrose is converted to starch in the sink areas, so there's always a lower concentration of sucrose at the sink than inside the phloem. This makes sure a constant supply of new sucrose reaches the sink from the phloem.The Mass Flow Hypothesis Best Explains Phloem TransportScientists still aren't certain exactly how the solutes are transported from source to sink by translocation. The best supported theory is the mass flow hypothesis:1) Active transport (see p. 42) is used to actively load the solutes (e.g. sucrose from photosynthesis) from companion cells into the sieve tubes of the phloem at the source (e.g. the leaves).2) This lowers the water potential inside the sieve tubes, so water enters the tubes by osmosis from the xylem and companion cells.3) This creates a high pressure inside the sieve tubes at the source end of the phloem.1) At the sink end, solutes are removed from the phloem to be used up.2) This increases the water potential inside the sieve tubes, so water also leaves the tubes by osmosis.3) This lowers the pressure inside the sieve tubes.(j) SOURCElow water potential, high pressurewater flow solute flow\u00a9sieve plate plasmodesma\u2014Water flows to xylem(2) SINK high water potential,\u00ae1) The result is a pressure gradient from the source end to the sink end.

The fluid from the bulge has a higher concentration of sugars than the fluid from below the ring \u2014 this is evidence that there's a downward flow of sugars.A radioactive tracer such as radioactive carbon (l4C) can be used to track the movement of organic substances in a plant (see below).Pressure in the phloem can be investigated using aphids (they pierce the phloem, then their bodies are removed leaving the mouthparts behind, which allows the sap to flow out... gruesome). The sap flows out quicker nearer the leaves than further down the stem \u2014 this is evidence that there's a pressure gradient.If a metabolic inhibitor (which stops ATP production) is put into the phloem, then translocation stops \u2014 this is evidence that active transport is involved.Sugar travels to many different sinks, not just to the one with the highest water potential, as the model would suggest._\\W \" I \/1 1 M I 11 H I ll \/; | \/ f 11 i \/11 11\/You could get asked about '__ correlations and casual relationships \u0000TU \u2022 | 4 I I , . , r, .

One example is carbon dioxide containing the radioactive isotope 14C. This radioactively-labelled COcan be supplied to a single leaf by being pumped into a container which completely surrounds the leaf.2) The radioactive carbon will then be incorporated into organic substances produced by the leaf (e.g. sugars produced by photosynthesis), which will be moved around the plant by translocation.3) The movement of these substances can be tracked using a technique called f^^,e,(; iS: autoradiography. To reveal where the radioactive tracer has spread to in a plant, the plant is killed (e.g. by freezing it using liquid nitrogen) and then the whole plant (or sections of it) is placed on photographic film\u2014 the radioactive substance is present wherever the film turns black.4) The results demonstrate the translocation of substances from source to sink over time \u2014 for example, autoradiographs of plants killed at different times show an overall movement of solutes (e.g. products of photosynthesis) from the leaves towards the roots.Autoradiograph of plant showing how radioactivity has spread from the leaf.Practice QuestionsLeaf exposed to MCO. gasQ1 According to the mass flow hypothesis, how is a pressure gradient set up in the phloem?Exam QuestionQ1 A scientist is investigating where the products of photosynthesis are translocated to in a plant.

Chromosomes are found in the nucleus.The DNA molecule is really long so, it has to be wound up so it can fit into the nucleus.The DNA molecule is wound around proteins called histones.Histone proteins also help to support the DNA.The DNA (and protein) is then coiled up very tightly to make a compact chromosome.DNA double-helixDNA Histone proteins A single chromosomeDNA wound around histone proteinsDNA with the protein is coiled up repeatedly= Eukary\u00b0t'c cells include - Z a\"'\u2122al and p|ant ce|)s r r \u201cr\u00b0karyotir cells are -My bacteria. =1111 111 111 i\\\\~6)The mitochondria and chloroplasts in eukaryotic cells also have their own DNA.

It's the order of bases in a gene that determines the order of amino acids in a particular polypeptide.4) Each amino acid is coded for by a sequence of three bases in a gene called a triplet, i :-^5s>5) To make a polypeptide, DNA is first copied into messenger RNA (mRNA).This is the first stage of protein synthesis (see p. 84).6) Genes that don't code for a polypeptide code for functional RNA instead.

These sections of DNA are called introns.There can be several introns within a gene.All the bits or a gene that do code for amino acids are called exons.Introns are removed during protein synthesis \u2014 so they don't affect the amino acid order. Their purpose isn't known for sure. (Prokaryotic DNA doesn't have introns.)Eukaryotic DNA also contains regions of multiple repeats outside of genes.These are DNA sequences that repeat over and over.

For example, the gene that determines blood type exists as one of three alleles \u2014 one determines type O, another type A and the other type B.In a eukaryotic cell nucleus, DNA is stored as chromosomes.Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, 46 in total \u2014 two number 1s, two number 2s, two number 3s, etc. Pairs of matching chromosomes (e.g. the 1s) are called homologous pairs.In a homologous pair, both chromosomes are the same size and have the same genes, although they could have different alleles.

Uracil always pairs with adenine during protein synthesis. RNA isn't all the same though. You need to know about:(Messenger RNA (mRNA))mRNA is made during transcription (see below). It carries the genetic code from the DNA to the ribosomes, where it's used to make a protein during translation (see next page). mRNA is a single ^ Basepolynucleotide strand.In mRNA, groups of three adjacent bases are usually called codons (they're sometimes Phosphate called triplets or base triplets). Ribose sugarvcodon(Transfer RNA (tRNA))tRNA is involved in translation. It carries the amino acids that are used to make proteins to the ribosomes. tRNA is a single polynucleotide strand that's folded into a clover shape.

It can be interpreted, just like any other code, which is exactly what you might have to do in your exam...The Genetic Code is Non-Overlapping, Degenerate and Universal1) The genetic code is the sequence of base triplets (codons) in mRNA which code for specific amino acids.2) In the genetic code, each base triplet is read in sequence, separate from the triplet before it and after it. Base triplets don't share their bases \u2014 the code is non-overlapping.Order of bases on mRNABase triplet (codon)Code read in sequencemRNA base tripletAminoacidOrder of amino acids in a proteinUCA = ( serine )3) The genetic code is also degenerate \u2014 there are more possible combinations of triplets than there are amino acids (20 amino acids but 64 possible triplets). This means that some amino acids are coded for by more than one base triplet, e.g. tyrosine can be coded for by UAU or UAC.4) Some triplets are used to tell the cell when to start and stop production of the protein \u2014 these are called start and stop signals (or codons). They're found at the beginning and end of the mRNA. E.g. UAG is a stop signal.5) The genetic code is also universal \u2014 the same specific base triplets code for the same amino acids in all living things. E.g. UAU codes for tyrosine in all organisms.You need to be able to Interpret Data about Nucleic AcidsThe table on the right shows the mRNA codons (triplets) for some amino acids.

Here's an example (you don't need to learn it):Investigating the effect of new drugs on nucleic acids1)2)3)4)5)6)7)To investigate how two new drugs affect nucleic acids and their role in protein synthesis, bacteria were grown in normal conditions for a few generations, then moved to media containing the drugs.After a short period of time, the concentration of protein and Bar rhart show mRNA and protein concentrationin the presence and absence of drugscomplete strands of mRNA in the bacteria were analysed The results are shown in the bar graph.Both mRNA and protein concentration were lower in the presence of drug 1 compared to the no-drug control. This suggests that drug 1 affects the production of full length mRNA, so there's no mRNA for protein synthesis during translation.mRNA production in the presence of drug 2 was unaffected, but less protein was produced \u2014 3 mg cm-3 compared to 8 mg cm\"3.This suggests that drug 2 interferes with translation. mRNA was produced, but less protein was translated from it.Further tests to establish the nature of the two drugs were carried out.Drug 1 was found to be a ribonuclease (an enzyme that digests RNA). This could explain the results of the first experiment \u2014 any strands of mRNA produced by the cell would be digested by drug 1, so couldn't be used in translation to make proteins.Drug 2 was found to be a single-stranded, clover-shaped molecule capable of binding to the ribosome.

In humans, non-disjunction of chromosome 21 during meiosis can lead to Down's Syndrome.Chromosome 211) Down's syndrome is caused by a person having an extra copy of chromosome 21 (or sometimes an extra copy of part of chromosome 21).2) Non-disjunction means that chromosome 21 fails to separate properly during meiosis, so one cell gets an extra copy of 21 and another gets none3) When the gamete with the extra copy fuses to another gamete at fertilisation, the resulting zygote will have three copies of chromosome 21.Non-disjunction occurs \u2014 homologous pair fails to separate.xVmu i M n- Non-disjunction t.\u2014 can also occur \u2014in meiosis II. \u2014\/1 ii r n ii' i1111sFertilisation \u20223 copies of chromosome 21ZygotePractice QuestionsQ1 Explain what is meant by the terms haploid and diploid.Q2 What happens to the chromosome number at fertilisation?Q3 What is a chromatid?Q4 Give three ways in which the outcome of meiosis differs from the outcome of mitosis.Exam QuestionsQ1 Drosophila (fruit flies) only have four chromosomes.The diagram on the right summarises meiosis in Drosophila.a) Complete the diagram to show the chromosomes in the four daughter cells.

Check. Brain switched on. Check. Cuppa piping hot. Check. Sweets on standby. Check. Okay, I think you're all sorted to start photosynthesis. Finally, take a deep breath and here we go...Photosynthesis Takes Place in the Chloroplasts of Plant Cells1) Chloroplasts are flattened organelles surrounded by a double membrane. They are found in plant cells.2) Thylakoids (fluid-filled sacs) are stacked up in the chloroplast into structures called grana (singular = granum).The grana are linked together by bits of thylakoid membrane called lamellae (singular = lamella).4) Chloroplasts contain photosynthetic pigments (e.g. chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotene). These are coloured substances that absorb the light energy needed for photosynthesis. The pigments are found in the thylakoid membranes \u2014 they're attached to proteins. The protein and pigment is called a photosystem.5) There are two photosystems used by plants to capture light energy.Photosystem I (or PSI) absorbs light best at a wavelength of 700 nm and photosystem II (PSII) absorbs light best at 680 nm.6) Contained within the inner membrane of the chloroplast and surrounding the thylakoids is a gel-like substance called the stroma. It contains enzymes, sugars and organic acids.7) Carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis and not used straight away are stored as starch grains in the stroma.outer memb'aneinner membrane stromathylakoid thylakoidmembrane lamellagranum(thylakoidcf arHPhotosynthesis can be Split into Two StagesThere are actually two stages that make up photosynthesis:crsmmammmm________cn- See p.' 108 for \\oad% more* * ' \u20141) As the name suggests, this reaction needs light energy.2) It takes place in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts.3) Here, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll (and other photosynthetic pigments) in the photosystems. The light energy excites the electrons in the chlorophyll, leading to their eventual release from the molecule.The chlorophyll has been photoionised.4) Some of the energy from the released electrons is used to add a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP, and some is used to reduce NADP to form reduced NADP. ATP transfers energy and reduced NADP transfers hydrogen to the light-independent reaction.5) During the process H^O is oxidised to 02.The Light-Independent Reaction1) This is also called the Calvin cycle and as the name suggests it doesn't use light energy directly. (But it does rely on the products of the light-dependent reaction.)2) It takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast.3) Here, the ATP and reduced NADP from the light-dependent reaction supply the energy and hydrogen to make simple sugars from CO,.\nIn the Light-Dependent Reaction ATP is Made by PhotophosphorylationIn the light-dependent reaction, the energy resulting from the photoionisation of chlorophyll is used for three things:1) Making ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. This reaction is called photophosphorylation (see p. 105).2) Making reduced NADP from NADP.3) Splitting water into protons (H+ ions), electrons and oxygen. This is called photolysis (see p. 105).The light-dependent reaction actually includes two types of photophosphorylation \u2014 non-cyclic and cyclic.Each of these processes has different products (see next page).Topic 5A \u2014 Photosynthesis and RespirationThis diagram shows how the two reactions link together in the chloroplast.thylakoid membrane Q.< c 0 ,e\n107PhotosynthesisNon-cyclic Photophosphorylation Produces ATP, Reduced NADP and O,To understand the process you need to know that the photosystems (in the thylakoid membranes) are linked by electron carriers. Electron carriers are proteins that transfer electrons. The photosystems and electron carriers form an electron transport chain \u2014 a chain of proteins through which excited electrons flow. All the processes in the diagrams are happening together \u2014 I've just split them up to make it easier to understand.1 ) Light energy excites electrons in chlorophyll jLight energy is absorbed by PSII.The light energy excites electrons in chlorophyll.The electrons move to a higher energy level (i.e. they have more energy).These high-energy electrons are released from the chlorophyll and move down the electron transport chain to PSI.LIGHT electron carrierthylakoidmembranetPSIiriiide the thylakoid1\/600 1s J*1, P7003^) Energy from the excited electrons makes ATP...)The excited electrons lose energy as they move down the electron transport chain.This energy is used to transport protons into the thylakoid. so that the thylakoid has a higher concentration of protons than the stroma.

Now you've enjoyed that poem, it's time to concentrate. I hope you like remembering reactions involved in respiration, because these pages have several.There are Two Types of Respiration1) The two types of respiration are aerobic (requires oxygen) and anaerobic (doesn't require oxygen).2) Both produce ATP (see p. 104), although anaerobic respiration produces less.3) Both start with the process of glycolysis (see below). The stages after glycolysis differ.Glycolysis Makes Pyruvate from Glucose1) Glycolysis involves splitting one molecule of glucose (with 6 carbons \u2014 6C) into two smaller molecules of pyruvate (3C).2) The process happens in the cytoplasm of cells.3) Glycolysis is the first stage of both aerobic and anaerobic respiration and doesn't need oxygen to take place \u2014 so it's an anaerobic process.There are Two Stages in Glycolysis Phosphorylation and OxidationFirst, ATP is used to phosphorylate glucose to triose phosphate. Overall there's a net gain of 2 ATP and 2 reduced NAD.Stage One \u2014 Phosphorylation]1) Glucose is phosphorylated using a phosphate from a molecule of ATP.This creates 1 molecule of glucose phosphate and 1 molecule of ADP.2) ATP is then used to add another phosphate, forming hexose bisphosphate.3) Hexose bisphosphate is then split into 2 molecules of triose phosphate.1) Triose phosphate is oxidised(loses hydrogen), forming 2 molecules of pyruvate.2) NAD collects the hydrogen ions, forming 2 reduced NAD.3) 4 ATP are produced, but 2 were used up in stage one, so there's a net gain of 2 ATP.ATPADPThen triose phosphate is oxidised, releasing ATP.glucoseDHnumber of carbons in the moleculeglucose phosphate |6C|ATPADPZ)Hhexose bisphosphate12 x triose phosphate4ATP2 NAD\n2 reduced NADIn aerobic respiration...1) The two molecules of reduced NAD go to oxidative phosphorylation \u2014 see page 116.2) The two pyruvate molecules are actively transported intothe matrix of the mitochondria for the link reaction (see the next page).In Anaerobic Respiration Pyruvate is Converted to Ethanol or LactateIn anaerobic respiration, the pyruvate produced in glycolysis is converted into ethanol (in plants and yeast) or lactate (in animal cells and some bacteria) using reduced NAD:Alcoholic Fermentation reducedCO.- NAD NADLactate Fermentation reduced NAD NADpyruvateethanalUethanolpyruvateylactate (lactic acid)The production of ethanol or lactate regenerates oxidised NAD. This means glycolysis can continue even when there isn't much oxygen around, so a small amount of ATP can still be produced to keep some biological processes going... clever.Topic 5A \u2014 Photosynthesis and Respiration\n7\/5Aerobic RespirationSo, as you know from the previous page, in aerobic respiration, the two molecules of pyruvate from glycolysis enter the mitochondrial matrix for the link reaction. Here's what happens next...The Link Reaction converts Pyruvate to Acetyl Coenzyme A1) Pyruvate is decarboxylated (one carbon atom is removed from pyruvate in the form of C02).2) Pyruvate is oxidised to form acetate and NAD is reduced to form reduced NAD.3) Acetate is combined with coenzyme A (CoA) to form acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA).4) No ATP is produced in this reaction.coenzyme A (CoA) \u201cpyruvate|3C|co?

(There arc some intermediate compounds formed during this conversion, but you don't need to know about them.)\u2022 Decarboxylation and dehydrogenation occur, producing one molecule of reduced FAD and two of reduced NAD.\u2022 ATP is produced by the direct transfer of a phosphate group from an intermediate compound to ADP. When a phosphate group is directly transferred from one molecule to another it's called substrate-level phosphorylation. Citrate has now been converted into oxaloacetate.Topic 5A \u2014 Photosynthesis and Respiration\n776Aerobic RespirationSome Products of the Krebs Cycle are Used in Oxidative PhosphorylationSome products are reused, some are released and others are used for the next stage of respiration:Productfrom one Krebs cycleWhere it goes1 coenzyme AReused in the next link reactionOxaloacetateRegenerated for use in the next Krebs cycle2 C02Released as a waste product1 ATPUsed for energy3 reduced NADTo oxidative phosphorylation1 reduced FADTo oxidative phosphorylationOxidative Phosphorylation Produces Lots of ATP1) Oxidative phosphorylation is the process where the energy carried by electrons, from reduced coenzymes (reduced NAD and reduced FAD), is used to make ATP.

This movement drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pj).6) This process of ATP production driven by the movement of H+ ions across a membrane (due to electrons moving down an electron transport chain) is called chemiosmosis (which is described by the chemiosmotic theory).7) In the mitochondrial matrix, at the end of the transport chain, the protons, electrons and 02 (from the blood) combine to form water.Oxygen is said to be the final electron acceptor.outer mitochondrial membrane intermembrane space inner mitochondrial membrane ---------------%---------------------High H\u2019 concentration H+ H+ H+ HH+ H+ H+\u2022P,H+Low H* concentrationATPATP synthaseTopic 5 A \u2014 Photosynthesis and Respiration\n777Aerobic Respiration32 ATP Can be Made from One Glucose MoleculeAs you know, oxidative phosphorylation makes ATP using energy from the reduced coenzymes\u2014 2.5 ATP are made from each reduced NAD and 1.5 ATP are made from each reduced FAD.The table on the right shows how much ATP a cell can make from one molecule of glucose in aerobic respiration.

But what are proteins? What do they look like? Well, for your enjoyment, here are the answers to all those questions and many, many more...Proteins are Made from Long Chains of Amino Acids1) The monomers of proteins are amino acids.2) A dipeptide is formed when two amino acids join together.3) A polypeptide is formed when more than two amino acids join together.4) Proteins are made up of one or more polypeptides.Grant's cries of \"die peptide, die\" could be heard for miles around.

They're much easier to explain if you describe their structure in four 'levels'. These levels are a protein's primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures.Primary Structure \u2014 this is the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain.Secondary Structure \u2014 the polypeptide chain doesn't remain flat and straight.Hydrogen bonds form between the amino acids in the chain.This makes it automatically coil into an alpha (a) helix or fold into a beta ((3) pleated sheet \u2014 this is the secondary structure.Tertiary Structure \u2014 the coiled or folded chain of amino acids is often coiled and folded further. More bonds form between different parts of the polypeptide chain, including hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds (attractions between negative and positive charges on different parts of the molecule).Disulfide bridges also form whenever two molecules of the amino acid cysteine come close together \u2014 the sulfur atom in one cysteine bonds to the sulfur atom in the other. For proteins made from a single polypeptide chain, the tertiary structure forms their final 3D structure.Quaternary Structure \u2014 some proteins are made of several different polypeptide chains held together by bonds. The quaternary structureis the way these polypeptide chains are assembled together.

The potential difference becomes more negative than the resting potential (i.e. less than -70 mV).^ Resting potential \u2014 the ion channels are reset. The sodium-potassium pump returns the membrane to its resting potential and maintains it until the membrane's excited by another stimulus.After an action potential, the neurone cell membrane can't be excited again straight away. This is because the ion channels are recovering and they can't be made to open \u2014 sodium ion channels are closed during repolarisation and potassium ion channels are closed during hyperpolarisation. This period of recovery is called the refractory period.The Action Potential Moves Along the Neurone as a Wave of Depolarisation1) When an action potential happens, some of the sodium ions that enter the neurone diffuse sideways.2) This causes sodium ion channels in the next region of the neurone to open and sodium ions diffuse into that part.3) This causes a wave of depolarisation to travel along the neurone.4) The wave moves away from the parts of the membrane in the refractory period because these parts can't fire anaction potential.refractory refractoryperiodi It's like a Mexican wave _ = travelling through a - = crowd \u2014 sodium ions _ ' rushing inwards causes __ = a wave of activity alongstimulus -+ + +----------------Nt Nlthe membrane. rwave of depolarisationThe Refractory Period Produces Discrete Impulses1) During the refractory period, ion channels are recovering and can't be opened.2) So the refractory period acts as a time delay between one action potential and the next.This means that:\u2022 action potentials don't overlap, but pass along as discrete (separate) impulses.\u2022 there's a limit to the frequency at which the nerve impulses can be transmitted.\u2022 action potentials are unidirectional (they only travel in one direction).Action Potentials have an AII-or-Nothing Nature1) Once the threshold is reached, an action potentialwill always fire with the same change in voltage, cmaiutimnlnc AAAno matter how big the stimulus is. a2) If the threshold isn't reached, an action potential won't fire.

Sodium ion channels are concentrated at the nodes.5) In a myelinated neurone, depolarisation only happens at the nodes of Ranvier (where sodium ions can get through the membrane).6) The neurone's cytoplasm conducts enough electrical charge to depolarise the next node, so the impulse 'jumps' from node to node. >7) This is called saltatory conduction and it's really fast.8) In a non-myelinated neurone, the impulse travels as a wave along the whole length of the axon membrane (so you get depolarisation along the whole length of the membrane).9) This is slower than saltatory conduction (although it's still pretty quick).Structure of a myelinated motor neurone -cell bodymyelin sheath made up of a Schwann cellnode of Ranvierpk-nodes of RanvierKAAAAJ UUUUUUnerve impulse= Y\u00b0\" need to learn the -r structure of a myelinated 3 z rnotor neurone \"\"\"''\"\"itfininxf\u00a9Axon diameterAction potentials are conducted quicker along axons with bigger diameters because there's less resistance to the flow of ions than in the cytoplasm of a smaller axon.

Take your time and try scribbling it all down a few times till it starts to make some kind of sense. Neurones work because there's an electrical charge across their membrane, which is set up by ion pumps and ion channels. It's a change in this charge that transmits an action potential.Topic 6B \u2014 Nervous Coordination\n","47":"139Synaptic TransmissionWhen an action potential arrives at the end of a neurone, the information has to be passed on to the next cell\u2014 this could be another neurone, a muscle cell or a gland cell.A Synapse is a Junction Between a Neurone and the Next Cell1) A synapse is the junction between a neurone and another neurone, or between a neurone and an effector cell, e.g. a muscle or gland cell.2) The tiny gap between the cells at a synapse is called the synaptic cleft.3) The presynaptic neurone (the one before the synapse) has a swelling called a synaptic knob. This contains synaptic vesicles filled with chemicals called neurotransmitters.4) When an action potential reaches the end of a neurone it causes neurotransmitters to be released into the synaptic cleft.They diffuse across to the postsynaptic membrane (the one after the synapse) and bind to specific receptors.5) When neurotransmitters bind to receptors they might trigger an action potential (in a neurone), cause muscle contraction(in a muscle cell), or cause a hormone to be secreted (from a gland cell).6) Because the receptors are only on the postsynaptic membranes, synapses make sure impulses are unidirectional \u2014 the impulse can only travel in one direction.7) Neurotransmitters are removed from the cleft so the response doesn't keep happening, e.g. they're taken backinto the presynaptic neurone or they're broken down by enzymes (and the products are taken into the neurone).8) There are many different neurotransmitters, e.g. acetylcholine (ACh) and noradrenaline. Synapses that use acetylcholine are called cholinergic synapses. Their structure is exactly the same as in the diagram above.Typical structure of a synapsepostsynaptic presynaptic ,- _ ff membranemembranesynapticknobvesiclefilled with synaptic receptorsneu-otransmitters cleft\nACh Transmits the Nerve Impulse Across a Cholinergic SynapseThis is how a nerve impulse is transmitted across a cholinergic synapse: 1)2)3)An action potential (see pages 136-137) arrives at the synaptic knob of the presynaptic neurone.The action potential stimulates voltage-gated calcium ion channels in the presynaptic neurone to open.Calcium ions diffuse into the synaptic knob.(They're pumped out afterwards by active transport.)vesicle containing AChCa2111 m i ii 11 n i n . m hi 'i\" Voltage-gated ion channels - - open at a certain voltage, r , I I I II 1 I I \\ l l I 1 l1 ' \" 1 \" 1vesicles fuse with the membrane and release ACharrival of action \u2014 potentialCa2AChreceptorsCa diffuses into the synaptic knobThe influx of calcium ions into the synaptic knob causes the synaptic vesicles to move to the presynaptic membrane. They then fuse with the presynaptic membrane.The vesicles release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) into the synaptic cleft\u2014 this is called exocytosis.6) ACh diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to specific cholinergic receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.7) This causes sodium ion channels in the postsynaptic neurone to open.8) The influx of sodium ions into the postsynaptic membrane causes depolarisation. An action potential on the postsynaptic membrane is generated if the threshold is reached.9) ACh is removed from the synaptic cleft so the response doesn't keep happening. It's broken down by an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the products are re-absorbed by the presynaptic neurone and used to make more ACh.ACh diffuses across and:ptors .> *\u20197S, #new action\u2014\u0000 potential) i* ais generatedAChE breaks down ACh and the products are re-absorbedTopic 6B \u2014 Nervous Coordination\n140Synaptic TransmissionNeurotransmitters Can be Excitatory, Inhibitory or Both1) Excitatory neurotransmitters depolarise the postsynaptic membrane, making it fire an action potential if the threshold is reached. E.g. acetylcholine is an excitatory neurotransmitter at cholinergic synapses in the CNS \u2014 it binds to cholinergic receptors to cause an action potential in the postsynaptic membrane \u2014 and at neuromuscular junctions (see below).2) Inhibitory neurotransmitters hyperpolarise the postsynaptic membrane (make the potential difference more negative), preventing it from firing an action potential. E.g. acetylcholine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter at cholinergic synapses in the heart. When it binds to receptors here, it can cause potassium ion channels to open on the postsynaptic membrane, hyperpolarising it.Summation at Synapses Finely Tunes the Nervous ResponseIf a stimulus is weak, only a small amount of neurotransmitter will be released from a neurone into the synaptic cleft. This might not be enough to excite the postsynaptic membrane to the threshold level and stimulate an action potential. Summation is where the effect of neurotransmitter released from many neurones (or one neurone that's stimulated a lot in a short period of time) is added together. There are two types of summation:Spatial summation1)2)3)Temporal summation_ + + + +Temporal summation is where two or more nerve impulses arrive in quick 4succession from the same presynaptic neurone. This makes an action potential u\u0000 r , \u0000 ,.................. r 7 r . High frequency or weak impulsesmore likely because more neurotransmitter is released into the synaptic cleft. _ action p0tent;a|Both types of summation mean synapses accurately process information, finely tuning the response.Neuromuscular Junctions are Synapses Between Neurones and Muscles1) A neuromuscular junction is a synapse betweena motor neurone and a muscle cell. ^2) Neuromuscular junctions use the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), which binds to cholinergic receptors called nicotinic cholinergic receptors.3) Neuromuscular junctions work in basically the same way as the cholinergic synapse shown on the previous page \u2014 but there are a few differences:\u2022 The postsynaptic membrane has lots of folds that form clefts. These clefts store the enzyme that breaks down ACh (acetylcholinesterase \u2014 AChE).\u2022 The postsynaptic membrane has more receptors than other synapses. ^imiiiiiiiiiiiiumiiii^. . - You need to be able to ^\u2022 ACh is always excitatory at a neuromuscular junction.

You might have to predict the effects that a drug would have at a synapse in your exam. Here are some examples of how drugs can affect synaptic transmission:\u00a9Some drugs are the same shape as neurotransmitters so they mimic their action at receptors (these drugs are called agonists).This means more receptors are activated.

This results in the muscle being paralysed.ACh \/Ino action potential\u00a9Some drugs inhibit the enzyme that breaks down neurotransmitters (they stop it from working).

This can lead to loss of muscle control.ACh <7enzyme. action potential\u00a9Some drugs stimulate the release of neurotransmitter from the presynaptic neurone so more receptors are activated, e.g. amphetamines.\u00a9Some drugs inhibit the release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic neurone so fewer receptors are activated, e.g. alcohol.Practice QuestionsQ1 How do synapses ensure that nerve impulses are unidirectional?Q2 Give one way that neurotransmitters are removed from the synaptic cleft.

When gametes from two parents fuse together, the alleles they contain form the genotype of the offspring produced. At each locus, the genotype can be homozygous or heterozygous.Genetic diagrams can be used to predict the genotypes and phenotypes of the offspring produced if two parents are crossed (bred). You need to know how to use genetic diagrams to interpret or predict the results of various crosses, including monohybrid crosses. Monohybrid inheritance is the inheritance of a characteristic controlled by a single gene. Monohybrid crosses show the likelihood of the different alleles of that gene (and so different versions of the characteristic) being inherited by offspring of certain parents.

This means colour blindness is much rarer in women than men.Parents'genotypesGametes'allelesPossible genotypes of offspringCarrier femaleUnaffected maleXN XnXN Y(g)XN XNX\"Y X\"XNXn YUnaffectedUnaffected Carrier Colour-blindfemalemalefemalemaleN \u2014 normal colour vision allele n \u2014 faulty colour vision allele7) In the example above, there's a 3 : 1 ratio of offspring without colour blindness : offspring with colour\u0000blindness. But when a female carrier and a male without colour-blindness have children (as in this example), only their male offspring are at risk of being colour-blind. So you can also say that there's a predicted 2:1:1 ratio \u2014 of female offspring without colour-blindness : male offspring without colour-blindness : male offspring with colour-blindness.8) This ratio will change if a female carrier (XNXn) and a male with colour-blindness (XnY) have children.The predicted ratio will then be 1 : 1 \u2014 of offspring with colour-blindness : offspring without colour-blindness. The ratio will be the same for offspring of each gender. You only end up with this predicted ratio for a monohybrid F, cross with a sex-linked characteristic.Some Autosomal Genes are LinkedD2)Autosome is the fancy name for any chromosome that isn't a sex chromosome.Autosomal genes are the genes located on the autosomes.Genes on the same autosome are said to be linked \u2014 because they're on the same autosome they'll stay together during the independent segregation of chromosomes in meiosis I, and their alleles will be passed on to the offspring together. The only reason this won't happen is if crossing over splits them up first3) The closer together two genes are on the autosome,the more closely they are said to be linked. This is because Genes A, B crossing over is less likely to split them up. T ^4) If two genes are autosomally linked, you won't get the ~ phenotypic ratio you expect in the offspring of a cross.5) For example, in a dihybrid cross between two heterozygous parents you'd expect a 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 ratio in the offspring (see previous page). Instead, the phenotypic ratio is more likely to be that expected for a monohybrid cross between two heterozygous parents (3:1) because the two autosomally-linked alleles are inherited together. This means that a higher proportion of the offspring will have their parents' (heterozygous) genotype and phenotype.6) This allows you to use the predicted phenotypic ratio to identify autosomal linkage.Topic 7A \u2014 Geneticsand C are all linked.Crossing over is when two homologous (paired) chromosomes swap bits'. It happens in meiosis I before independent segregation. You'll have learnt about this in Year 1 of your course.An autosomeGenes A and B are more closely linked than genes A and C.\n760Linkage and EpistasisGenetic Cross Results Can Show Autosomal LinkageIn the exam you might get some genetic cross results that show linkage and have to explain them.ExampleA scientist was investigating linkage between the genes for eye colour and wing length in fruit flies.The gene for normal wings (N) is dominant to the gene for vestigial wings (n) and the gene for red eyes (R) is dominant to the gene for purple eyes (r). The first cross the scientist carried out was between flies homozygous dominant for both normal wings and red eyes (NNRR) and flies homozygous recessive for both vestigial wings and purple eyes (nnrr). The resulting offspring were all heterozygous for normal wings and red eyes (NnRr).The second cross the scientist carried out was between these offspring (NnRr) and the flies homozygous recessive for vestigial wings and purple eyes (nnrr).He expected a 1 : I : 1 :1 ratio as shown below:i n 111 m n 11111 m i m \/\/, _ This is known as a back -Parents'allelesNnRrGametes'Tcross (crossing the offspring - with one of the parents). ~\"'I I 1 I I M M II I I I I I 11 III I I \"NHowever, the results he got forail*les V\/Kjy'C\/Vy \\ \u00a9 \u00a9 \u00ae \u00a9this cross show a 8 : 1 : 1 : 8 ratio as in the table:Number of offspringNnRrNnRrNnRrNnRrNormal wings, red eyes = 4Normal wings, red eyes (NlnRr)1216\u00a9NnrrNnrrNnrrNnrrNormal wings, purple eyes = 4Normal wings, purple eyes (Nnrr)152nnRrnnRrnnRrnnRrVestigial wings, red eyes = 4Vestigial wings, red eyes (nnRr)148\u00a9nnrrnnrrnnrrnnrrVestigial wings, purple eyes = 4Vestigial wings, purple eyes (nnrr)1184Phenotypic ratio = 1 :1 :1 :1Phenotypic rato = 8 : 1 : 1 : 8In order for the NnRr and nnrr genotypes to be so common in the offspring, the NR alleles and the nr alleles in the NnRr parent must have been linked. This means that the NnRr parent produced mostly NR and nr gametes. Some Nr and nR gametes were still made due to crossing over, but there were fewer Nnrr and nnRr offspring overall. As a result, a higher proportion of the offspring have their parents' phenotypes.An Epistatic Gene Masks the Expression of Another Gene1) Many different genes can control the same characteristic \u2014 they interact to form the phenotype.2) This can be because the allele of one gene masks (blocks) the expression of the alleles of other genes\u2014 this is called epistasis.Example 1In humans a widow's peak (see picture) is controlled by one gene and baldness by others. If you have the alleles that code for baldness, it doesn't matter whether you have the allele for a widow's peak or not, as you have no hair. The baldness genes are epistatic to the widow's peak gene, as the baldness genes mask the expression of the widow's peak gene.Example 2Flower pigment in a plant is controlled by two genes. Gene 1 codes for a yellow pigment (Y is the dominant yellow allele) and gene 2 codes for an enzyme that turns the yellow pigment orange (R is the dominant orange allele). If you don't have the Y allele it won't matter if you have the R allele or not as the flower will be colourless. Gene 1 is epistatic to gene 2 as it can mask the expression of gene 2.gene 2 (RR or Rr) \u0000geneColourlessI |YellowOrangemolecule.^pigmentpigment3) Crosses involving epistatic genes don't result in the expected phenotypic ratios given above, e.g. if you cross two heterozygous orange flowered plants (YyRr) from the above example you wouldn't get the expected 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 phenotypic ratio for a normal dihybrid cross.Topic 7A \u2014 Genetics\n767Linkage and EpistasisYou can Predict the Phenotypic Ratios for Some Epistatic GenesJust as you can predict the phenotypic ratios for a normal dihybrid cross (see page 158), you can predict the phenotypic ratios for dihybrid crosses involving some epistatic genes too:A dihybrid cross involving a recessive epistatic allele \u2014 9Having two copies of the recessive epistatic allele masks (blocks) the expression of the other gene.

If a plant is homozygous recessive for the epistatic gene (yy) then it will be colourless, masking the expression of the orange gene. So if you cross homozygous parents, you should get a 9 : 3 : 4 ratio of orange : yellow : white in the F2 generation. You can check the phenotypic ratio is right using a genetic diagram:A dihybrid cross involving a dominant epistatic allele \u2014 12:3:1Having at least one copy of the dominant epistatic allele masks (blocks) the expression of the other gene. Crossing a homozygous recessive parent with a homozygous dominant parent will produce a 12 : 3 : 1 phenotypic ratio of dominant epistatic : recessive epistatic dominant other: recessive both in the F3 generation.E.g. squash colour is controlled by two genes \u2014 the colour \u00a3 crossepistatic gene (W\/w) and the yellow gene (Y\/y). The no-colour, white allele (W) is dominant over the coloured allele (w), so WW or Ww will be white and ww will be coloured. The yellow gene has the dominant yellow allele (Y) and the recessive green allele (y). So if the plant has at least one W, then the squash will be white, masking the expression of the yellow gene. So if you cross wwyy with WWYY, you'll get a 12 : 3 : 1 ratio of white : yellow : green in the F2 generation.

And here's why...Totipotent Stem Cells are Able to Mature into Any Type of Body Cell1) Multicellular organisms are made up from many different cell types that are specialised for their function, e.g. liver cells, muscle cells, white blood cells.2) All these specialised cell types originally came from stem cells.3) Stem cells are unspecialised cells that can develop into other types of cell.4) Stem cells divide to become new cells, which then become specialised.5) All multicellular organisms have some form of stem cell.6) Stem cells are found in the embryo (where they become all the specialised cells needed to form a fetus) and in some adult tissues (where they become specialised cells that need to be replaced, e.g. stem cells in the intestines constantly replace intestinal epithelial cells).7) Stem cells that can mature (develop) into any type of body cell in an organism,(including the cells that make up the placenta in mammals) are called totipotent cells.8) Totipotent stem cells are only present in mammals in the first few cell divisions of an embryo.9) After this point the embryonic stem cells become pluripotent. They can still specialise into any cell in the body, but lose the ability to become the cells that make up the placenta.10) The stem cells present in adult mammals are either:\u2022 Multipotent stem cells \u2014 These are able to differentiate into a few different types of cell. For example, both red and white blood cells can be formed from multipotent stem cells found in bone marrow.\u2022 Unipotent stem cells \u2014 These can only differentiate into one type of cell.For example, there's a type of unipotent stem cell that can only divide to produce epidermal skin cells, which make up the outer layer of your skin.Stem Cells Become Specialised Because Different Genes are ExpressedStem cells become specialised because during their development, they only transcribe and translate part of their DNA:1)2)3)4)5)6)Stem cells all contain the same genes \u2014 but during development, not all of them are transcribed and translated (expressed).\"Mill III,, ,, m\u201e(\/- Remember: transcription is 3 Z when DNA is copied into ^- mRNA.

These changes are difficult to reverse, so once a cell has specialised it stays specialised. oft^e 9irls expresseddifferent jeans.[Example: Red Blood Cells')1) Red blood cells are produced from a type of stem cell in the bone marrow. They contain lots of haemoglobin and have no nucleus (to make room for more haemoglobin).2) The stem cell produces a new cell in which the genes for haemoglobin production are expressed. Other genes, such as those involved in removing the nucleus, are expressed too. Many other genes are not expressed (switched off), resulting in a specialised red blood cell.Topic 8A \u2014 Mutations and Gene Expression\n187Stem CellsCardiomyocytes Can be Made from Unipotent Stem Cells1) Cardiomyocytes are heart muscle cells that make up a lot of the tissue in our hearts.In mature mammals, it's thought that they can't divide to replicate themselves.2) This meant that for ages, everyone thought that we weren't able to regenerate our own heart cells at all. This is a major problem if the heart becomes damaged, e.g. by a heart attack, or the cells became worn out through age. Recent research however, has suggested that our hearts dohave some regenerative capability.3) Some scientists now think that old or damaged cardiomyocytes can be replaced by new cardiomyocytes derived from a small supply of unipotent stem cells in the heart.4) Some researchers think that this process could be constantly occurring,but haven't yet agreed on how quickly it happens.\u2022 Some believe that it's a really slow process and that it's possible that somecardiomyocytes are never replaced throughout a person's entire lifetime.\u2022 Others think that it's occurring more quickly, so that everycardiomyocyte in the heart is replaced several times in a lifetime.Stem Cells Can be Used to Treat Human DisordersSince stem cells can divide into a range of specialised cell types, doctors and scientists think they could be used to replace cells damaged by illness or injury.Some Stem Cell Therapies Already Exist1) Some stem cell therapies already exist for some diseases affecting the blood and immune system.2) Bone marrow contains stem cells that can bccomc specialised to form any type of blood cell. Bone marrow transplants can be used to rcplace the faulty bone marrow in patients that produce abnormal blood cells. The stem cells in the transplanted bone marrow divide and specialise to produce healthy blood cells.3) This technique has been used successfully to treat leukaemia (a cancer of the blood or bone marrow) and lymphoma (a cancer of the lymphatic system).4) It has also been used to treat some genetic disorders, such as sickle-cell anaemia and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID):Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a genetic disorder that affects the immune system. People with SCID have a poorly functioning immune system as their white blood cells (made in the bone marrow from stem cells) are defective. This means they can't defend the body against infections by identifying and destroying microorganisms. So SCID sufferers are extremely susceptible to infections. Treatment with a bone marrow transplant replaces the faulty bone marrow with donor bone marrow that contains stem cells without the faulty genes that cause SCID. These then differentiate to produce functional white blood cells. These cells can identify and destroy invading pathogens, so the immune system functions properly.Stem Cells Could be Used to Treat Other DiseasesScientists are researching the use of stem cells as treatment for lots of conditions, including:\u2022 Spinal cord injuries \u2014 stem cells could be used to replace damaged nerve tissue. n n t,,,, f n \\\\i1'\u2022 Heart disease and damage caused by heart attacks \u2014 ~ These tr\u20acatmentsbwt -stem cells could be used to replace damaged heart tissue. \u201c aren't z\u2022 Bladder conditions \u2014 stem cells could be used to grow whole bladders, ^ ^^dimcal trials.

Stem cells could be used to grow organs for those people awaiting transplants.\u2022 They could improve the quality of life for many people \u2014 e.g. stem cells could be used to replace damaged cells in the eyes of people who are blind.Human Stem Cells Can Come from Adult Tissue or EmbryosTo use stem cells scientists have to get them from somewhere. There are three main potential sources of human stem cells:(5Adult Stem Cells1) These are obtained from the body tissues of an adult.For example, adult stem cells are found in bone marrow.2) They can be obtained in a relatively simple operation \u2014 with very little risk involved, but quite a lot of discomfort.3) Adult stem cells aren't as flexible as embryonic stem cells \u2014 they can only specialise into a limited range of cells, not all body cell types (they're multipotent).<\u00a3Embryonic Stem Cells1) These are obtained from embryos at an early stage of development.2) Embryos are created in a laboratory using in vitro fertilisation (IVF) \u2014 egg cells are fertilised by sperm outside the womb.3) Once the embryos are approximately 4 to 5 days old, stem cells are removed from them and the rest of the embryo is destroyed.4) Embryonic stem cells can divide an unlimited number of times and develop into all types of body cells (they're pluripotent).(2Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPS Cells)x\\l1 l M ' M I) | \/ | , | | |l, , , , (|- Inscription factors are - r proteins that control whether =- \u00b0r not genes are transcribed ~'\/a see Pa9e 190 for more Z \/n f'11 ii 11 \/ , \/111 M , M)Xs\"1) iPS cells are created by scientists in the lab. The process involves 'reprogramming' specialised adult body cells so that they become pluripotent.2) The adult cells are made to express a series of transcription factors that are normally associated with pluripotent stem cells. The transcription factors cause the adult body cells to express genes that are associated with pluripotency.3) One of the ways that these transcription factors can be introduced to the adult cells is by infecting them with a specially-modified virus. The virus has the genes coding for the transcription factors within its DNA. When the virus infects the adult cell, these genes are passed into the adult cell's DNA, meaning that the cell is able to produce the transcription factors.4) Induced pluripotent stem cells could become really useful in research and medicine in the future\u2014 see next page. At the moment though, more research into how similar they actually are to true pluripotent embryonic stem cells is needed before they can be properly utilised.Topic 8A \u2014 Mutations and Gene Expression\n7 89Stem CellsThere are Ethical Issues Surrounding Embryonic Stem Cell Use1) Obtaining stem cells from embryos created by IVF raises ethical issues because the procedure results in the destruction of an embryo that could become a fetus if placed in a womb.2) Some people believe that at the moment of fertilisation an individual is formed that has the right to life \u2014 so they believe that it's wrong to destroy embryos.3) Some people have fewer objections to stem cells being obtained from egg cells that haven't been fertilised by sperm, but have been artificially activated to start dividing. This is because the cells couldn't survive past a few days and wouldn't produce a fetus if placed in a womb.4) Some people think that scientists should only use adult stem cells because their production doesn't destroy an embryo. But adult stem cells can't develop into all the specialised cell types that embryonic stem cells can.5) This is where induced pluripotent stem cells could prove really useful. They have the potential to be as flexible as embryonic stem cells, but, as they're obtained from adult tissue, there aren't the same ethical issues surrounding their use. Good news all round.6) It's also possible that iPS cells could be made from a patient's own cells. These iPS cells, which would be genetically identical to the patient's cells, could then be used to grow some new tissue or an organ that the patient's body wouldn't reject (rejection of transplants occurs quite often and is caused by the patient's immune system recognising the tissue as foreign and attacking it).7) The decision makers in society have to take into account everyone's views when making decisions about important scientific work like stem cell research and its use to treat human disorders.m i n i n 111111 m i u w \/11111111111 n n n 111 n 1111111 n 111111111 \/111 n 111\/.- You might be asked to evaluate the use of stem cells in treating human disorders in r r the exams \u2014 so make sure you know all the pros and cons on pages 187 to 189. -\"n I I I i n I I I I I I I I 11 11 I I II i \/ \/ u l M I II II I I I II I I I I I M I I I I I I I I I I II I II I 11 \/ M I IIsPractice QuestionsQ1 At what stage of development can totipotent stem cells be found in mammals?Q2 Describe the difference between pluripotent and multipotent stem cells.Q3 How do stem cells become specialised?Q4 Name two conditions that stem cells could potentially be used to treat.Q5 Describe one difference between embryonic and adult stem cells.Exam QuestionQ1 Scientists are currently exploring the potential for the use of stem cells in medicine.a) Explain one way in which stem cell therapy is currently being used.

Totipotent stem cells are the most flexible, followed by pluripotent, multipotent, then unipotent stem cells.

Mwah ha hah.Transformed Organisms Are Made Using Recombinant DNA Technology1) Microorganisms, plants and animals can all be transformed using recombinant DNA technology. This is called genetic engineering.2) Transformed microorganisms can be made using the same technology as in vivo cloning (see page 199). For example, foreign DNA can be inserted into microorganisms to produce lots of useful protein, e.g. insulin:jvM \/1 \" 1 I I \" , , , , , , , , I , 1 , # ( !

( I\\\n3)4)5)Transformed plants can also be produced. A gene that codes for a desirable protein is inserted into a plasmid. The plasmid is added to a bacterium and the bacterium is used as a vector to get the gene into the plant cells.If the right promoter region has been added along with the gene (see p. 199), the transformed cells will be able to produce the desired protein.Transformed animals can be produced too \u2014 a gene that codes for a desirable protein can be inserted into an early animal embryo or into the egg cells of a female. If the gene is inserted into a very early embryo, all the body cells of the resulting transformed animal will end up containing the gene. Inserting it into the egg cells means that when the female reproduces, all the cells of her offspring will contain the gene.Promoter regions that are only activated in specific cell types can be used to control exactly which of an animal's body cells the protein is produced in. If the protein is only produced in certain cells, it can be harvested more easily. Producing the protein in the wrong cells could also damage the organism.Recombinant DNA Technology Can be Used to Benefit HumansTransformed organisms (microorganisms, plants and animals) can be used in a variety of ways. You need to be able to interpret information about how they are used. Here are some examples:AgricultureAgricultural crops can be transformed so that they give higher yields or are more nutritious. This means these plants can be used to reduce the risk of famine and malnutrition. Crops can also be transformed to have pest resistance, so that fewer pesticides are needed. This reduces costs and reduces any environmental problems associated with using pesticides.For example, Golden Rice is a variety of transformed rice. It contains one gene from a maize plant and one gene from a soil bacterium, which together enable the rice to produce beta-carotene. The beta-carotene is used by our bodies to produce vitamin A. Golden Rice is being developed to reduce vitamin A deficiency in areas where there's a shortage of dietary vitamin A, e.g. south Asia, Africa. Vitamin A deficiency is a big problem in these areas, e.g. up to 500 000 children per year worldwide go blind due to vitamin A deficiency.IndustryIndustrial processes often use biological catalysts (enzymes). These enzymes can be produced from transformed organisms, so they can be produced in large quantities for less money, reducing costs.For example, chymosin (or rennin) is an enzyme used in cheese-making. It used to be made from rennet (a substance produced in the stomach of cows), but it can now be produced by transformed organisms. This means it can be made in large quantities, relatively cheaply and without killing any cows, making some cheese suitable for vegetarians.MedicineMany drugs and vaccines are produced by transformed organisms, using recombinant DNA technology. They can be made quickly, cheaply and in large quantities using this method.For example, insulin is used to treat Type 1 diabetes and used to come from animals (cow, horse or pig pancreases). This insulin wasn't human insulin though, so it didn't work quite as well. Human insulin is now made from transformed microorganisms, using a cloned human insulin gene (see above).Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n202Using Recombinant DNA TechnologyThere are Concerns About the Use of Recombinant DNA Technology...There are ethical, financial and social issues associated with the use of recombinant DNA technology:AgricultureFarmers might plant only one type of transformed crop (this is called monoculture). This could make the whole crop vulnerable to the same disease because the plants are genetically identical. Environmentalists are also concerned about monocultures reducing biodiversity, as this could damage the environment.Some people are concerned about the possibility of 'superweeds' \u2014 weeds that are resistant to herbicides. These could occur if transformed crops interbreed with wild plants. There could then be an uncontrolled spread of recombinant DNA, with unknown consequences.Organic farmers can have their crops contaminated by wind-blown seeds from nearby genetically modified crops. This means they can't sell their crop as organic and may lose their income.IndustryAnti-globalisation activists oppose globalisation (e.g. the growth of large multinational companies at the expense of smaller ones). A few, large biotechnology companies control some forms of genetic engineering. As the use of this technology increases, these companies get bigger and more powerful. This may force smaller companies out of business, e.g. by making it harder for them to compete. Without proper labelling, some people think they won't have a choice about whether to consume food made using genetically engineered organisms.Some consumer markets, such as the EU, won't import GM foods and products. This can cause an economic loss to producers who have traditionally sold to those markets.MedicineCompanies who own genetic engineering technologies may limit the use of technologies that could be saving lives.Some people worry this technology could be used unethically, e.g. to make designer babies (babies that have characteristics chosen by their parents). This is currently illegal though.Recombinant DNA technology also creates ownership issues. Here are some examples:\u2022 There is some debate about who owns genetic material from humans once it has been removed from the body \u2014 the donor or the researcher. Some people argue that the individual holds the right to their own genetic information, however others argue that value is created by the researcher who uses it to develop a medicine or in diagnosis.\u2022 A small number of large corporations own patents to particular seeds. They can charge high prices, sometimes including a 'technology fee', and can require farmers to repurchase seeds each year.If non-GM crops are contaminated by GM crops, farmers can be sued for breaching the patent law....But Humanitarians Think it will Benefit PeopleRecombinant DNA technology has many potential humanitarian benefits:1) Agricultural crops could be produced that help reduce the risk of famine and malnutrition, e.g. drought-resistant crops for drought-prone areas.2) Transformed crops could be used to produce useful pharmaceutical products (e.g. vaccines) which could make drugs available to more people, e.g. in areas where refrigeration (usually needed for storing vaccines) isn't available.3) Mcdicines could be produced more chcaply, so more people can afford them.4) Recombinant DNA technology has the potential to be used in gene therapy to treat human diseases (see next page).>0U need to be able z- to balance the humanitarian : r h\/neflts opposing views =- from environmentalists and ~ S ant|-9|obalisat,on activists r(see above) -Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n203Using Recombinant DNA TechnologyGene Therapy Could be Used to Treat or Cure Genetic Disorders and CancerRecombinant DNA technology could also be used to treat human diseases.

For example, cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that's very damaging to the respiratory system, so somatic therapy for CF targets the epithelial cells lining the lungs. Somatic therapy doesn't affect the individual's sex cells (sperm or eggs) though, so any offspring could still inherit the disease.2) Germ line therapy \u2014 this involves altering the alleles in the sex cells. This means that every cell of any offspring produced from these cells will be affected by the gene therapy and they won't suffer from the disease. Germ line therapy in humans is currently illegal though.There are also many ethical issues associated with gene therapy. For example, some people are worried that the technology could be used in ways other than for medical treatment, such as for treating the cosmetic effects of aging. Other people worry that there's the potential to do more harm than good by using the technology (e.g. risk of overexpression of genes \u2014 gene produces too much of the missing protein).Practice QuestionsQ1 What are transformed organisms?Q2 Give one financial issue associated with the use of recombinant DNA technology in industry.Q3 What is gene therapy?Exam Questionof wheat plants.

E.g. an organism with a surface area to volume ratio of 2 : 1 would theoretically have a surface area twice as large as its volume.3) Ratios are usually most useful in their simplest (smallest) form. To simplify a ratio, divide each side by the same number. It's in its simplest form when there's nothing left you can divide by. To get a ratio of X : Y in the formX : 1, divide both sides by Y. E.g. to get 28 : 34 into the ratio of X : 1, divide both sides by 34. You get 0.82 : 1.You Need to be Able to Use Logarithms1) It's tricky to plot graphs with very small and very large numbers (e.g. both 0.1 and 1000) on the same axis.2) We can make it easier by converting values to their logarithms and plotting them on a logarithmic scale (e.g. a logl0 scale).3) On a log1() scale, each value is ten times larger than the value before.

To do this add together all the data values and divide by the total number of values in the sample.TesttubeMass (g)Mean (g) ^Range (g)Repeat 1Repeat 2Repeat 3A283732(28 + 37 + 32) -r 3 = 32.337-28 = 9B475160(47 + 51 + 60) -+ 3 = 52.760-47 = 13--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2) You might also need to calculate the range (how spread out the data is).^To do this find the largest data value and subtract the smallest data value from it.3) Standard deviation can be more useful than the range because it tells you how values are spread about the mean rather than just the total spread of data. A small standard deviation means the repeated results are all similar and close to the mean, i.e. they are precise.Like the mean, the median and mode are both types of average.\u2022 To calculate the median, put all your data in numerical order. The median is the middle value in this list.If you have an even number of values, the median is halfway between the middle two values.\u2022 To calculate the mode, count how many times each value comes up. The mode is the number thatappears most often. A set of data might not have a mode \u2014 or it might have more than one.Practical Skills\n277Processing and Presenting DataWatch Out For Significant Figures...D2)3)The first significant figure of a number is the first digit that isn't a zero. The second, third and fourthsignificant figures follow on immediately after the first (even if they're zeros).When you're processing your data you may well want to round any really long numbers to a certainnumber of significant figures. E.g. 0.6878976 rounds to 0.69 to 2 s.f..When you're doing calculations using measurements given to a certain number of significant figures, you should give your answer to the lowest number of significant figures that was used in the calculation.For example: ^Miiiiifniiiiiiiiiiinuuiii\/\/r When rounding a number, if the r 1.2 -r 1 .85 = 0.648648648... =0.65 E next digit after the last significant Z^ Round the last - figure you're using is less than five, - 2 s.f.-^3 s.f.

COn i j n ii n ii m i n ii 11111 m 11 This is because the fewer digits a measurement has, the less accurate it is.Your answer can only be as accurate as the least accurate measurement in the calculation...and Standard Form1) When you're processing data you might also want to change very big or very small numbers that have lots of zeros into something more manageable \u2014 this is called standard form.E.g. 1 000 000 can be written 1 x 10\u00b0 and 0.01 7 can be written 1.7x1 O'2.2) To do this you just need to move the decimal point left or right. The number of places the decimal point moves is then represented by a power of 10 \u2014 this is positive for big numbers, and negative for numbers smaller than one. For example:fVW\\A rabbit playing the piano. Definitely not standard form.16 5 00 = 1.65 x 104 The decimal point has moved four places to the left, so the power of 10 is +4. \/YYY^0.000362 = 3.62 x 10~4 The decimal point has moved four places to the right, so the power of 10 is -4.You Need to Understand How and When Statistical Tests are Used to Analyse Data1) The Student's t-test. You can use the Student's t-test when you have two sets of data that you want to compare. It tests whether there is a significant difference in the means of the two data sets. The value obtained is compared to a critical value, which helps you decide how likely it is that the results or 'differences in the means' were due to chance. If the value obtained from the t-test is greater than the critical value at a probability (P value) of 5% or less (< 0.05), then you can be 95% confident that the difference is significant and not due to chance. This is called a 95% confidence limit \u2014 which is good enough for most biologists to reject the null hypothesis. A null hypothesis is a special type of hypothesis used with statistical tests. It states that there's no significant difference between the things you're measuring.2) The Chi-squared test (see pages 162-163). You can use the Chi-squared test when you have categorical (grouped) data and you want to compare whether your observed results are statistically different from your expected results. You compare your result to a critical value \u2014 if it's larger than the critical value at P = 0.05, you can be 95% certain the difference is significant.3) A correlation coefficient, e.g. the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. This test allows you to work out the degree to which two sets of data are correlated (see page 213 for more on correlation).It is given as a value between 1 and -1. A value of 1 indicates a strong positive correlation, 0 means there is no correlation and -1 is a strong negative correlation. You can then compare your result toa critical value to find out whether or not the correlation is significant. \u0000. m u i u u n n i\/w u n i m 11 n i' i u i ^ (___________You can be more confident in your conclusions (see page 213), if they're based on results that have been analysed using a statistical test.; You need to be familiar with the symbols ,: < (less than), > (more than), \u00ab (much= less than) and \u00bb (much greater than . -^M|1|IMM>MIMIlUUlMlininMPractical Skills\n272Processing and Presenting DataUse a Suitable Graph or Chart to Present Your DataScatter graph:Graphs and charts are a great way of presenting data \u2014 they can make results much easier to interpret.1) When you have qualitative data (non-numerical data, e.g. blood group) or discrete data (numericaldata that can only take certain values in a range, e.g. shoe size) you can use bar charts or pie charts.2) When you have continuous data (data that can take any value in arange, e.g. height or weight) you can use histograms or line graphs.3) When you want to show how two variables are related(or correlated, see next page) you can use a scatter graph.Whatever type of graph you use, you should make sure that:\u2022 The dependent variable goes on the y-axis (the vertical axis) and the independent on the x-axis (the horizontal axis).\u2022 You always label the axes, include the quantity and units, and choose a sensible scale.\u2022 The graph covers at least half of the graph paper.If you need to draw a line (or curve) of best fit on a scatter graph,draw the line through or as near to as many points as possible,ignoring any anomalous results.line of fopstfit;<X'XalomaloiISresult\\-N<X-*\u2014i\u2014Average temperature (\u00b0C)Find the Rate By Finding the GradientRate is a measure of how much something is changing over time. Calculating a rate can be useful when analysing your data, e.g. you might want to the find the rate of a reaction. Rates are easy to work out from a graph:For a linear graph you can calculate the Change in Yrate by finding the gradient of the line: Gradient = (^|iange jn ^c -I r . *u- i 24 mmol dm-3 ^ ^ . .-5 So in this example: rate =----------------- = 2.4 mmol dm 3 min1e 10 minutesEThe equation of a straight line can always be written in the form y = mx + c, where m is the gradient and c is the y-intercept (this is the value of y when the line crosses the y-axis). In this example, the equation of the line is y = 2.4x + 0 (or just y = 2.4x). Knowing the equation of the line allows you to estimate results not plotted on the graph. E.g. in this case, when x (the time) is 20 min, y (the sodium ion concentration) will be 2.4x = 2.4 x 20 =5 10Time \/ minThe change in x is 10 min.For a curved (non-linear) graph you can find the rate by drawing a1) Position a ruler on the graph at the point where you want to know the rate.2) Angle the ruler so there is equal space between the ruler and the curve on either side of the point.3) Draw a line along the ruler to make the tangent.Extend the line right across the graph \u2014 it'll help to make your gradient calculation easier as you'll have more points to choose from.4) Calculate the gradient of the tangent to find the rate.Gradient = 55 m2 -f 4.4 years = 12.5 m2 year1When calculating a rate (or anything else for that matter) you might have to convert between units, e.g. seconds and minutes.

But what are proteins? What do they look like? Well, for your enjoyment, here are the answers to all those questions and many, many more...Proteins are Made from Long Chains of Amino Acids1) The monomers of proteins are amino acids.2) A dipeptide is formed when two amino acids join together.3) A polypeptide is formed when more than two amino acids join together.4) Proteins are made up of one or more polypeptides.Grant's cries of \"die peptide, die\" could be heard for miles around. He'd never forgiven it for sleeping with his wife.Different Amino Acids Have Different Variable GroupsAmino acids have the same general structure \u2014 a carboxyl group (-COOH), an amine or amino group (-NH2) and an R group (also known as a variable side group).Structure of an Amino AcidR ^\u2014variable groupIH,N \u2014 CCOOH\\groupcarboxylgroupAll living things share a bank of only 20 amino acids.The only difference between them is what makes up their R group.Polypeptides are Formed by Condensation ReactionsE.g.

They're much easier to explain if you describe their structure in four 'levels'. These levels are a protein's primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures.Primary Structure \u2014 this is the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain.Secondary Structure \u2014 the polypeptide chain doesn't remain flat and straight.Hydrogen bonds form between the amino acids in the chain.This makes it automatically coil into an alpha (a) helix or fold into a beta ((3) pleated sheet \u2014 this is the secondary structure.Tertiary Structure \u2014 the coiled or folded chain of amino acids is often coiled and folded further. More bonds form between different parts of the polypeptide chain, including hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds (attractions between negative and positive charges on different parts of the molecule).Disulfide bridges also form whenever two molecules of the amino acid cysteine come close together \u2014 the sulfur atom in one cysteine bonds to the sulfur atom in the other. For proteins made from a single polypeptide chain, the tertiary structure forms their final 3D structure.Quaternary Structure \u2014 some proteins are made of several different polypeptide chains held together by bonds. The quaternary structureis the way these polypeptide chains are assembled together. For proteins made from more than one polypeptide chain (e.g. haemoglobin, insulin, collagen), the quaternary structure is the protein's final 3D structure.amino acid\nTopic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n9ProteinsProteins have a Variety of FunctionsThere are loads of different proteins found in living organisms. They've all got different structures and shapes, which makes them specialised to carry out particular jobs. For example:1) Enzymes \u2014 they're usually roughly spherical in shape due to the tight folding of the polypeptide chains. They're soluble and often have roles in metabolism, e.g. some enzymes break down large food molecules (digestive enzymes, see pages 66-67) and other enzymes help to synthesise (make) large molecules.< ] j >2) Antibodies \u2014 are involved in the immune response. They're made up of two light (short)polypeptide chains and two heavy (long) polypeptide chains bonded together. Antibodies have variable regions (see p. 44) \u2014 the amino acid sequences in these regions vary greatly.v____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________y3) Transport proteins \u2014 e.g. channel proteins arepresent in cell membranes (p. 38).

This means the substrate won't fit into the active site, an enzyme-substrate complex won't be formed and the enzyme will no longer be able to carry out its function.6) The tertiary structure of an enzyme may be altered by changes in pH or temperature (see next page).7) The primary structure (amino acid sequence) of a protein is determined by a gene. If a mutation occurs in that gene (see p. 91), it could change the tertiary structure of the enzyme produced.Practice QuestionsQ1 What is an enzyme?Q2 What is the name given to the amount of energy needed to start a reaction?Q3 What is an enzyme-substrate complex?Q4 Why can an enzyme only bind to one substance?[4 marks] [2 marks]Exam QuestionsQ1 Dcscribc the \u2018induced fit\u2019 model of enzyme action.Q2 Explain how a change in the amino acid sequence of an enzyme may prevent it from functioning properly.But why is the enzyme-substrate complex?So enzymes lower the activation energy of a reaction.

Humans need things like money and the newest mobile phone, but enzymes are quite content with the right temperature and pH.Temperature has a Big Influence on Enzyme ActivityLike any chemical reaction, the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction increases when the temperature's increased. More heat means more kinetic energy, so molecules move faster. This makes the enzymes more likely to collide with the substrate molecules. The energy of these collisions also increases, which means each collision is more likely to result in a reaction. But, if the temperature gets too high, the reaction stops.1) The rise in temperature makes the enzyme's molecules vibrate more.2) If the temperature goes above a certain level, this vibration breaks some of the bonds that hold the enzyme in shape.3) The active site changes shape and the enzyme and substrate no longer fit together.4) At this point, the enzyme is denatured\u2014 it no longer functions as a catalyst.optimum temperature11 nn 11,TemperaturepH Also Affects Enzyme ActivityO\u2019\" \" I M I | | | ,, , ,~ Every enzyme has an enzyme is r optimum temperature = denatured r For most human enzymes - r ,t,saro^37\u00b0C but some r _ enzymes, like those used in ~- biological washing powders, ~ ~ can work well at 60 \u00b0C ~All enzymes have an optimum pH value. Most human enzymes work best at pH 7 (neutral), but there are exceptions. Pepsin, for example, works best at acidic pH 2, which is useful because it's found in the stomach. Above and below the optimum pH, the H+ and OH ions found in acids and alkalis can mess up the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds that hold the enzyme's tertiary structure in place. This makes the active site change shape, so the enzyme is denatured.Enzyme Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction1) The more enzyme molecules there are in a solution,the more likely a substrate molecule is to collide with one and form an enzyme-substrate complex. So increasing the concentration of the enzyme increases the rate of reaction.2) But, if the amount of substrate is limited, there comes a point when there's more than enough enzyme molecules to deal with all the available substrate, so adding more enzyme has no further effect.steady increase as more active sites are available \\if substrate amount is limited, an increase in enzyme concentration eventually has no further effectEnzyme ConcentrationSubstrate Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction Up to a Pointsteady increase as more substrate molecules are availableall active sites used \u2014 increase in substrate concentration has no further effectSubstrate Concentration1) The higher the substrate concentration, the faster the reaction \u2014 more substrate molecules means a collision between substrate and enzyme is more likely and so more active sites will be used. This is only true up until a 'saturation' point though. After that, there are so many substrate molecules that the enzymes have about as much as they can cope with(all the active sites are full), and adding more makes no difference.2) Substrate concentration decreases with time during a reaction (unless more substrate is added to the reaction mixture), so if no other variables are changed, the rate of reaction will decrease over time too. This makes the initial rate of reaction (the reaction rate at the start) the highest rate of reaction.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","57":"SPECIFICATION \nREFERENCE1 THE CHEMISTRY OF LIFE 1A\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n \u25fcUnder stand the importance of water as a solvent in transport, including its dipole nature.\nIONIC AND COVALENT BONDING\nBiology is the study of  living things \u2013 but living things consist of  chemical substances.

When the atoms of  two or more different elements react, they form a compound. An atom is made up of  a nucleus containing positive protons and neutral neutrons. The nucleus is surrounded by negative electrons. We can show this in a model as electrons orbiting around the nucleus in shells. When an atom has a full outer shell of  electrons, it is stable and does not react. However, most atoms do not have a full outer shell of  electrons. In chemical reactions, these electrons are involved in changes that give the atom a stable outer shell. There are two ways they can achieve this.\n \u2022Ionic bonding:\n the atoms involved in the reaction give or receive electrons. One atom, or part of  \nthe molecule, gains one or more electrons and becomes an anion (a negative ion).

Without water, \nsubstances could not move around the body. Water is one of  the reactants in the process of  photosynthesis, on which almost all life depends (see fig E). Understanding the properties of  water will help you understand many key systems in living organisms. \nWater is also a major habitat \u2013 it supports more life than any other \npart of  the planet.\n\u25b2 fig E  W ater is vital for life on Earth in many different ways \u2013 in a desert, \nthe smallest amount of water allows plants to grow.\nThe simple chemical formula of  water is H2O. This tells us that \ntwo atoms of  hydrogen are joined to one atom of  oxygen to make \nup each water molecule. However, because the electrons are held closer to the oxygen atom than to the hydrogen atoms, water is a polar molecule (see fig F).\n104.5\u00b0O\u03b42\nH\u03b41H\u03b41\n\u25b2 fig F  A model of a w ater molecule showing dipoles.\nOne major effect of  this polarity is that water molecules form hydrogen  bonds. The slightly negative oxygen atom of  one water \nmolecule will attract the slightly positive hydrogen atoms of  other water molecules in a weak electrostatic attraction called a hydrogen \nbond. Each individual hydrogen bond is weak but there are many of  them so the molecules of  water \u2018stick together\u2019 more than you might expect (see fig G). Water has relatively high melting and boiling points compared with other substances that have molecules of  a similar size because it takes a lot of  energy to break all the hydrogen bonds that hold the molecules together. Hydrogen bonds are important in protein structure (see Sections 1A.5 and 2B.1) \nand in the structure and functioning of  DNA (see Section 2B.3).O\u03b42\nO\u03b42\nH\u03b41H\u03b41H\u03b41H\u03b41\nH\u03b41O\u03b42O\u03b42\nO\u03b42H\u03b41\nH\u03b41\nH\u03b41H\u03b41H\u03b41\n\u25b2 fig G  Hydr ogen bonding in water molecules, based on attraction \nbetween positive and negative dipoles.\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF WATER\nThe properties of  water make it very important in biological \nsystems for many reasons.\n \u2022W ater is a polar solvent. Because it is a polar molecule, many ionic \nsubstances like sodium chloride will dissolve in it (see fig H).  \nMany covalently bonded substances are also polar and will dissolve in water, but often do not dissolve in other covalently bonded solvents such as ethanol. Water also carries other substances, such as starch. As a result, most of  the chemical reactions within cells occur in water (in aqueous solution).\nsodium and chloride ionsin solution in water\nsalt and water mixed\nsodium chloride\nNaClionic bond sodium ionchlorideion\u03b41 chargeson hydrogenin water areattracted tonegativechloride ion\n\u03b42\n charges\non oxygenin water ar\ne\nattracted tothe positivesodium ionH\nH\nHHH\nH HO\nOO\nCl2\nCl2\nCl2Cl2\nCl2\nNa1OH\nCl2\nNa1Na1\nCl2Cl2\nCl2\nCl2Cl2\nNa1Na1Na1 Na1\nNa1Na1Na1\n\u25b2 fig H  A model of sodium chloride dissolving in water as a result of the \ninteractions between the charges on sodium and chloride ions and the dipoles of the water molecules.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

As it \ncools further, the molecules become more widely spaced. As a result, ice is less dense than water and floats, forming an insulating layer and helping to prevent the water underneath it from freezing. It also melts quickly because, being at the top, it is exposed to the sun. It is very unusual for the solid form of  a substance to be less dense than the liquid form. This unusual property enables organisms to live in water, even in countries where it gets cold enough to freeze in winter.\n \u2022W\nater is slow to absorb and release heat \u2013 it has a high specific \nheat capacity. The hydrogen bonds between the molecules need a lot of  energy to separate them. This means the temperature of  large bodies of  water such as lakes and seas does not change much throughout the year. This makes them good habitats for living organisms.\n \u2022W\nater is a liquid \u2013 it cannot be compressed. This is an \nimportant factor in many hydraulic mechanisms in living organisms.\n \u2022W\nater molecules are cohesive \u2013 the forces between the \nmolecules mean they stick together. This is very important for the movement of  water from the roots to the leaves of  plants (see Sections 4A.3 and 4A.4).\n \u2022W\nater molecules are adhesive \u2013 they are attracted to other \ndifferent molecules. This is also important in plant transport systems and in surface tension.\n \u2022W\nater has a very high surface tension because the attraction \nbetween the water molecules, including hydrogen bonds, is greater than the attraction between the water molecules and the air. As a result, the water molecules hold together forming a thin \u2018skin\u2019 of  surface tension. Surface tension is very important in plant transport systems, and also affects life at the surface of  ponds, lakes and other water masses (see fig I).\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that co means two similar things together, as in cohabit, \nand ad means two different things together.\n\u25b2 fig I Without surface tension, a r aft spider like this could not move \nacross the water and hunt.EXAM HINT\nAll these properties are a result of dipoles and hydrogen bonding between water molecules.

The dragonfly \nand the plant it is resting on in fig A are all made of  chemicals. So is the cow in fig C \u2013 and it needs the chemical known as salt which it is licking to stay alive. If  you understand some of  the basic principles of  chemistry, you will develop a much better understanding of  biological systems. The chemical bonds within and between molecules affect the properties of  the compounds they form. This affects their functions within the cell and the organism. For example, if  you want to understand the chemistry of  water, you need to understand chemical bonds and how dipoles are created within molecules. \n\u25b2 fig A  All life depends on some v ery fundamental chemistry.\nThe basic unit of  all elements is the atom. When the atoms of  two or more different elements react, they form a compound. An atom is made up of  a nucleus containing positive protons and neutral neutrons. The nucleus is surrounded by negative electrons. We can show this in a model as electrons orbiting around the nucleus in shells. When an atom has a full outer shell of  electrons, it is stable and does not react. However, most atoms do not have a full outer shell of  electrons. In chemical reactions, these electrons are involved in changes that give the atom a stable outer shell. There are two ways they can achieve this.\n \u2022Ionic bonding:\n the atoms involved in the reaction give or receive electrons. One atom, or part of  \nthe molecule, gains one or more electrons and becomes an anion (a negative ion). The other atom, \nor part of  the molecule, loses one or more electrons and becomes a cation (a positive ion). Strong \nforces of  attraction called ionic bonds hold the oppositely charged ions together (see fig B).\nCl 1\n(2,8,7)\nchlorine atomNaKey\n   or    r epresents\na single electr on\n(2,8,1)\nsodium atomNa\n(2,8)\nsodium ionCl\n(2,8,8)\nchloride ion11\n22\n\u25b2 fig B  T he formation of sodium chloride (salt), an inorganic substance that is very important in living organisms, is \nan example of ionic bonding.1.1\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Covalent \nbonds are very strong and the molecules formed are usually neutral. However, in some covalent \ncompounds, the molecules are slightly polarised: this means that the electrons in the covalent bonds \nare not quite evenly shared. Consequently, the molecule has a part that is slightly negative and a part that is slightly positive. This separation of  charge is called a dipole, and the tiny charges are represented as \u03b4\n + and \u03b4  \u2013 (see fig F). The molecule is described as a polar molecule.

In theory, a minor cut could endanger life as the torn blood vessels \nallow blood to escape. First, your blood volume will reduce and if  you lose too much blood, you will die. Second, pathogens can get into your body through an open wound. In normal circumstances, your body protects you through the clotting mechanism of  the blood. This mechanism seals damaged blood vessels to minimise blood loss and prevent pathogens getting in.\nFORMING A CLOT\nPlasma, blood cells and platelets flow from a cut vessel. Contact between the platelets and components of  the tissue (e.g. collagen fibres in the skin) causes the platelets to break open in  large numbers. They release several substances, two of  which are particularly important.\n \u2022Ser\notonin causes the smooth muscle of  the blood vessel to contract.

Vitamin K is important in the production of  many of  the compounds needed for the blood to clot, including prothrombin. Here is a simple version of  the events in the blood clotting process.\n1\n T\nhromboplastin catalyses the conversion of  a large soluble protein called prothrombin found in \nthe plasma into another soluble protein, the enzyme called thrombin. Prothrombin is biologically \ninactive while thrombin is biologically active \u2013 prothrombin is a precursor of  thrombin. This conversion happens on a large scale at the site of  a wound. Calcium ions need to be present in the blood at the right concentration for this reaction to happen. \n2\n T\nhrombin acts on another soluble plasma protein called fibrinogen, converting it to an insoluble \nsubstance called fibrin. Again, fibrinogen is the biologically inactive precursor of  biologically active fibrin. The fibrin forms a mesh of  fibres to cover the wound.LEARNING TIP\nRemember that \u2018pro\u2019 means \nbefore.

The arteries and veins are like the large roads carrying heavy traffic while the narrow town streets and tracks are represented by the vast area of  branching and spreading capillaries called the capillary network. In the capillary network, substances carried by the blood are exchanged with cells in the same way that products are transported from factories, oil refineries or farms and distributed into shops and homes. The structures of  the different types of  blood vessel closely reflect their functions in your body.\nARTERIES\nArteries carry blood away from your heart towards the cells of  your body. The structure of  an artery is shown in fig A. Almost all arteries carry oxygenated blood. The exceptions are:\n \u2022the pulmonar\ny artery \u2013 carrying deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs\n \u2022the umbilical ar\ntery \u2013 during pregnancy, this carries deoxygenated blood from the fetus to  \nthe placenta.\nThe arteries leaving the heart branch off  in every direction, and the diameter of  the lumen, the central space inside the blood vessel, gets smaller the further away it is from the heart. The very smallest branches of  the arterial system, furthest from the heart, are the arterioles. \nThe middle layers of\nthe artery wall containelastic \ufb01bres and smoothmuscle; arteries nearestthe heart have more elastic\ufb01bres, those further fromthe heart have a greaterproportion of muscle tissue.\nelastic \ufb01bres andsmooth musclelumentough outerlayer\nendotheliumexternal layerof tough tissue\nThe endothelium forms asmooth lining which allows theeasiest possible \ufb02ow of blood.Lumen is small whenartery unstretched by\ufb02ow of blood from heart.\n\u25b2 fig A  T he structure of an artery means it is adapted to cope with the surging of the blood as the heart pumps.\nBlood is pumped out from the heart in a regular rhythm, about 70 times a minute. Each heartbeat \nsends a high-pressure flow of  blood into the arteries. The major arteries close to the heart must withstand these pressure surges. Their walls contain a lot of  elastic fibres, so they can stretch to accommodate the greater volume of  blood without being damaged (see fig B). Between surges, the elastic fibres return to their original length, squeezing the blood to move it along in a continuous flow. The pulse you can feel in an artery is the effect of  the surge each time the heart beats. The blood pressure in all arteries is relatively high, but it falls in arteries further away from the heart. These are known as the peripheral arteries. LEARNING TIP\nRemember that all arteries carry \nblood away from the heart, so they have thick walls and lots of collagen to withstand the high pressure.\nEXAM HINT\nYou will study the structure and the function of the types of blood vessel separately. However, you should remember that the vessels do not exist separately \u2013 they are all interlinked within the whole circulatory system.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

This is called recoil. The elastic recoil does not help to increase pressure, it simply helps to maintain the pressure \u2013 so do not suggest that the recoil helps pump blood along.\nIn the peripheral arteries, the muscle fibres in the vessel walls \ncontract or relax to change the size of  the lumen, controlling the blood flow. The smaller the lumen, the harder it is for blood to flow through the vessel. This controls the amount of  blood that flows into an organ, so regulating its activity.

Remember to link this to things you may learn later such as how blood flow to the skin changes when you are too hot or too cold.\nCAPILLARIES\nArterioles lead into networks of  capillaries. These are very small \nvessels that spread throughout the tissues of  the body. The capillary network links the arterioles and the venules. Capillaries branch between cells \u2013 no cell is far from a capillary, so substances can diffuse between cells and the blood quickly. Also, because the diameter of  each individual capillary is small, the blood travels relatively slowly through them, giving more opportunity for diffusion to occur (see fig C). The smallest capillary is no wider than a single red blood cell.\nCapillaries have a very simple structure which is well adapted \nto their function. Their walls are very thin and contain no elastic fibres, smooth muscle or collagen. This helps them fit between individual cells and allows rapid diffusion of  substances between the blood and the cells. The walls consist of  just one very thin cell. Oxygen and other molecules, such as digested food molecules and hormones, quickly diffuse out of  the blood in the capillaries into the nearby body cells, and carbon dioxide and other waste molecules diffuse into the capillaries. Blood entering the capillary network from the arteries is oxygenated. When it leaves, it carries less oxygen and more carbon dioxide.\nwaste material \ne.g. carbon dioxideoxygen andfood molecules\ncapillary wall(epithelial cells)\nsingle red blood cells\n\u25b2 fig C  T he very thin walls of capillaries allow rapid diffusion of oxygen, \ncarbon dioxide and digested food molecules.

They act as a blood reservoir. The blood pressure in the veins is relatively low \u2013 the pressure surges from the heart are eliminated before the blood reaches the capillary system. This blood at low pressure must be returned to the heart and lungs to be oxygenated again and recirculated.\nThe blood is not pumped back to the heart, it returns to the heart \nby means of  muscle pressure and one-way valves.\n \u2022Man\ny of  the larger veins are situated between the large muscle \nblocks of  the body, particularly in the arms and legs. When  the muscles contract during physical activity they squeeze these veins. The valves (see below) keep the blood travelling  in one direction and this squeezing helps to return the blood  to the heart. \n \u2022T\nhere are one-way valves at frequent intervals throughout \nthe venous system. These are called semilunar valves because of  their half-moon shape. They develop from infoldings of  the inner wall of  the vein. Blood can pass through towards the heart, but if  it starts to flow backwards the valves close, preventing any backflow (see fig E).semilunar\nvalve open muscle\ncontracte d\nvein\nveinmusclerelaxedsemilunar valve shutBlood moving in the direction of the heart forces the valve open, allowing the blood to \ufb02ow through.\nA back\ufb02ow of blood will close the valve, ensuring \nthat blood cannot \ufb02ow away from the heart.\n\u25b2 fig E  V alves in the veins make sure blood only flows in one direction \u2013 \ntowards the heart.

In \nmammals, the heart is a complex, four-chambered muscular organ that sits in the chest protected by the ribs and sternum. In an average lifetime, the heart beats about 3\n 000\n 000\n 000 (3 \u00d7 109) times and \nwill pump over 200\u00a0million litres of  blood \u2013 quite a workload.\nTHE STRUCTURE OF THE HEART\nThe human heart, like other mammalian hearts (see fig A), is not a single muscular pump but two pumps, joined and working in time together. The right side of  the heart receives blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs. The left side of  the heart receives blood from the lungs and pumps it to the body. The blood in each side of  the heart does not mix with the blood from the other side. The two sides are separated by a thick, muscular septum. The heart is made of  a unique type of  muscle, known as cardiac muscle, which has special properties \u2013 it can carry on contracting regularly without resting or getting fatigued. Y ou will study this in more detail in Book 2 Topic 7. Cardiac muscle has a good blood supply \u2013 the coronary arteries bring oxygenated blood to the tissue (see fig B). It also contains lots of  myoglobin, a respiratory pigment which has a stronger affinity for oxygen than haemoglobin. This myoglobin stores oxygen for the respiration needed to keep the heart contracting regularly.\nsuperior vena cavaright pulmonary artery\n(to right lung)\nthinner cardiac muscleof right ventricleaorta\naorta    \ufb02ow of oxygenated blood\n    \ufb02ow of deoxygenated bloodcarotid arteries\nto neck and head\nright pulmonary vein\n(from right lung)\nsemilunar valve\nright atrium\ntricuspid valve\ninferior vena cavaleft pulmonary artery (to left lung)\napex of heart\nseptumleft atrium\nsemilunar valve\nthick cardiacmuscle of leftventricleleft pulmonaryvein (from leftlung)\ntendinous cordsbicuspid valve\n\u25b2 fig A  T he structure of the human heart\n\u25b2 fig B  T he coronary arteries, \nwhich you can clearly see here, carry oxygenated blood from the aorta to the heart muscle, providing it with oxygen and digested food and removing carbon dioxide.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Make it clear that both atria pump at the same time and both ventricles pump at the same time.\n1 T he inferior vena cava collects deoxygenated blood from the \nlower parts of  the body, while the superior vena cava receives \ndeoxygenated blood from the head, neck, arms and chest. Deoxygenated blood is delivered to the right atrium.\n2\n T\nhe right atrium receives the blood from the great veins. As it \nfills with blood, the pressure builds up and opens the tricuspid valve, so the right ventricle starts to fill with blood too. When the atrium is full it contracts, forcing more blood into the ventricle. The atrium has thin muscular walls because it receives blood at low pressure from the inferior vena cava and the superior vena cava and it needs to exert relatively little pressure to move the blood into the ventricle. One-way semilunar valves (like the valves in veins described in Section\u00a01B.3) at the entrance to the atrium stop a backflow of  blood into the veins.\n3\n \nThe tricuspid valve consists of  three flaps and is also \nknown as an atrioventricular valve because it separates an atrium from a ventricle. The valve allows blood to pass from the atrium to the ventricle, but not in the other direction. The tough tendinous cords, also known as valve tendons or heartstrings, make sure the valves are not turned inside out by the pressure exerted when the ventricles contract.\n4\n T\nhe right ventricle is filled with blood under some pressure \nwhen the right atrium contracts, then the ventricle contracts. Its muscular walls produce the pressure needed to force blood out of  the heart into the pulmonary arteries. These carry the deoxygenated blood to the capillaries in the lungs. As the ventricle starts to contract, the tricuspid valve closes to prevent blood flowing into the atrium. Semilunar valves, like those in veins, prevent the blood flowing back from the arteries into the ventricle.\n5\n T\nhe blood returns from the lungs to the left side of  the heart in \nthe pulmonary veins. The blood is at relatively low pressure after passing through the extensive capillaries of  the lungs. The blood returns to the left atrium, another thin-walled chamber that performs the same function as the right atrium. It contracts to force blood into the left ventricle. Backflow is prevented by another atrioventricular valve known as the bicuspid valve , which has only two flaps.\n6\n As the left a\ntrium contracts, the bicuspid valve opens and the \nleft ventricle is filled with blood under pressure. As the left ventricle starts to contract the bicuspid valve closes to prevent backflow of  blood to the left atrium. The left ventricle pumps the blood out of  the heart and into the aorta, the major artery of  the body. This carries blood away from the heart at even higher pressure than the major arteries that branch off  from it. \nThe muscular wall of  the left side of  the heart is much thicker than that of  the right. The right side pumps blood to the lungs, which are relatively close to the heart. The delicate capillaries of  the lungs need blood delivered at relatively low pressure. The left side must produce sufficient force to move the blood under pressure to all the extremities of  the body and overcome the elastic recoil of  the arteries. Semilunar valves prevent the blood flowing back from the aorta into the ventricle.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that the valves do not operate on their own. They open \nand close as blood pressure changes in the chambers on either side of the valve. When the pressure is higher on one side it will push the valve open. When it is higher on the other side, it will close the valve.\nThe septum is a thick wall of  muscle and connective tissue \nbetween the two sides of  the heart. It prevents the oxygenated blood mixing with the deoxygenated blood. \nDID YOU KNOW? \nIn an embryo, there is a gap in the septum called the foramen ovale and the blood from the two sides of the heart can mix. This does not matter because the lungs of the fetus do not function and little blood flows to them. At birth, this hole closes over as the lungs begin to function. If it does not, the baby has a condition called patent foramen ovale or \u2018hole in the heart\u2019 . This may be  so small it does not really matter. If it is large, it must be closed  by surgery.\nDID YOU KNOW? \nInside the heart\nThe diagrams we use of the inside of a mammalian heart make it \nlook very clean and simple (see fig A). But when you dissect the heart of a mammal such as a sheep or a cow, you can see that it is much more complicated. Cutting open a heart and exploring the connections between the blood vessels and the chambers of the heart, and seeing the structure of the valves, helps you understand how it works as a three-dimensional pump (see fig C).\n\u25b2 fig C  A dissected mammalian heart\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

The sounds are not made by the contracting of  the heart muscle but by the heart valves closing. The two sounds of  a heartbeat are often described as \u2018lub-dub\u2019. The first sound (\u2018lub\u2019) comes when the ventricles contract and the blood is forced against the atrioventricular valves. The second sound (\u2018dub\u2019) comes when the ventricles relax and a backflow of  blood hits the semilunar valves in the pulmonary artery and aorta. The rate of  your heartbeat shows how frequently your heart is contracting.\nTHE CARDIAC CYCLE\nY our heart is continuously contracting then relaxing. The contraction of  the heart is called systole. Systole can be divided into atrial systole, when the atria contract together forcing blood into the ventricles, and ventricular systole, when the ventricles contract. Ventricular systole happens about 0.13 seconds after atrial systole, and forces blood out of  the ventricles into the pulmonary artery and the aorta. Between contractions the heart relaxes and fills with blood. This relaxation stage is called diastole. One cycle of  systole and diastole makes up a single heartbeat, which lasts about 0.8\u00a0seconds in humans. This is known as the cardiac cycle (see fig D).

Globally, almost 18\u00a0million \npeople die from cardiovascular diseases each year. World Health Organization (WHO) data from 2017 show that cardiovascular diseases were responsible for 31% of  all global deaths \u2013 it is the single biggest cause of  death and disability (see fig A). What is more, around a third of  these deaths were in people younger than 70.\nMany cardiovascular diseases are linked to a condition called atherosclerosis.\nATHEROSCLEROSIS\nAtherosclerosis, a hardening of  the arteries, is a disease in which plaques (made of  a yellowish fatty \nsubstance) build up on the inside of  arteries. It can begin in late childhood and continues throughout life. A plaque can continue to develop until it restricts the flow of  blood through the artery or even blocks it completely. Plaques are most likely to form in the arteries of  the heart (coronary arteries) and neck (carotid arteries). The typical development of  a plaque is summarised in fig B.\nartery walls\nSlight damage to the endothelial cells lining\nthe artery leads to an in\ufb02ammatory response,followed by a build-up of cholestero l.smooth normalendothelium\nThe fatty deposits grow to form an atheroma.\nFibrous tissue and calcium salts build up ar\nound\nthe atheroma forming a hardened plaque which\nnarrows the artery and makes the walls rigid.\n\u25b2 fig B  T he development of atherosclerosis \nWe can now look at this development in more detail. Atherosclerosis begins with damage to the \nendothelial lining of  blood vessels. This damage can be caused by several factors, including high blood pressure and substances in tobacco smoke. Atherosclerosis usually occurs in arteries rather than in veins. This is because the blood in the arteries flows fast under relatively high pressure, which puts more strain on the endothelial lining of  the vessels and can cause small areas of  damage. In the veins, the pressure is lower so damage to the endothelium is much less likely.cardiovascular diseases\n31%\n27%9%33%communicable (infectious)\ndiseases, childbirth andnutritional conditions \ninjuries\nall other causes\ncardiovascular diseases\n31%\n27%9%33%communicable (infectious)\ndiseases, childbirth andnutritional conditions \ninjuries\nall other causes\n\u25b2 fig A  T his WHO data from 2017 \nshows cardiovascular disease is the biggest single cause of death around the world.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that damage to the \nendothelium occurs first and this is often caused by high blood pressure, often as a result of smoking.\nEXAM HINT\nLearn the stages of the development of atherosclerosis: damage to the endothelium of the arteries \u2192 inflammatory response \u2192 accumulation of cholesterol \u2192 atheroma \u2192 fibrous tissue\/calcium salts \u2192 plaque \u2192 narrowing\/loss of elasticity of the artery.1.11 1.10\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion. Not for resale, circulation or distribution in whole or in part. \u00a9Pearson 201845 1B.5 ATHEROSCLEROSIS MAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS\nOnce damage to the endothelium has occurred, the body\u2019s inflammatory response begins and \nwhite blood cells arrive at the site of  the damage. These cells accumulate chemicals from the blood, especially cholesterol. This leads to a plaque (also known as an atheroma) forming on the endothelial lining of  the artery (see fig C). Fibrous tissue and calcium salts also build up (increase in amount) around the atheroma, turning it into a hardened plaque. This hardened area means that part of  the artery wall is less elastic and narrower than it should be. This is atherosclerosis and is summarised in fig B.\nThe plaque causes the lumen of  the artery to become much smaller. This increases the blood \npressure, making it harder for the heart to pump blood around the body. The raised blood pressure makes damage more likely in other areas of  the endothelial lining and more plaques will form.  This will make the blood pressure even higher, and so the problem gets worse. There are many factors that are linked to the development of  atherosclerosis. Y ou will look at these in more detail  in Chapter 1C.\nEFFECT OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS ON HEALTH\nAtherosclerosis can have many serious effects on the health of  an individual. The development  of  atherosclerosis can be summarised as: damage to the endothelium of  the arteries \u2192 inflammatory response \u2192 accumulation of  cholesterol \u2192 atheroma \u2192 fibrous tissue\/calcium salts \u2192 plaque \u2192 narrowing\/loss of  elasticity of  the artery.\nANEURYSMS\nIf  an area of  an artery is narrowed by plaque, blood tends to collect behind the blockage. The artery bulges and the wall is put under more pressure than usual, so it becomes weakened. This is known as an aneurysm. The weakened artery wall may split open, leading to massive internal bleeding. Aneurysms frequently happen in the blood vessels supplying the brain or in the aorta, especially when it passes through the abdomen. The massive blood loss and drop in blood pressure are often fatal, but if  aneurysms are diagnosed they can be treated by surgery before they burst.\nRAISED BLOOD PRESSURE\nThe arteries narrowed due to plaques on the walls cause raised blood pressure. This can lead to severe damage in a number of  organs, including the kidneys, the eyes and the brain. The high pressure damages the tiny blood vessels where your kidney filters out urea and other substances from the blood. If  the vessels feeding the kidney tubules become narrowed, the pressure inside them gets even higher and proteins may be forced out through their walls. If  you have high blood pressure, your doctors can test for protein in your urine as a sign of  kidney damage. \nSimilarly, the tiny blood vessels supplying the retina of  your eye are easily damaged. If  they become \nblocked or leak, the retinal cells are starved of  oxygen and die and this can cause blindness. \nBleeding from the capillaries into the brain results in one type of  stroke (see below).\nHEART DISEASE\nThere are many kinds of  heart disease, but the two most common ones are angina and myocardial \ninfarction (heart attack); both are closely linked to atherosclerosis (see figs B and D ).\nIn angina, plaques build up slowly in the coronary arteries, reducing blood flow to the parts of  the heart muscle beyond the plaques. Often symptoms are first noticed during exercise, when the cardiac muscle is working harder and needs more oxygen. The narrowed coronary arteries cannot supply enough oxygenated blood and the heart muscle resorts to anaerobic respiration. This causes a gripping pain in the chest that can extend into the arms, particularly the left one, and the jaw, and often also causes breathlessness. The symptoms of  angina subside once exercise stops, but the experience is painful and frightening.\nFortunately, most angina is relatively mild. It can be helped by taking regular exercise, losing weight \nand not smoking. The symptoms can be treated by drugs that cause rapid dilation of  the coronary blood vessels so that they supply the cardiac muscle with the oxygen it needs. However, if  the blockage of  the coronary arteries continues to get worse, so will the symptoms of  the angina. Other drugs are then used to dilate the blood vessels and reduce the heart rate. Unfortunately, drugs cannot \n\u25b2 fig C  F atty deposits like these \nin an artery cause disease and death in millions of people  every year.\nEXAM HINT\nMake sure you are clear about \nall of the different terms.

As you have seen, the wall of  an artery affected  by a plaque is stiffened, making it much more likely to suffer cracks or damage. Platelets touch the damaged surface of  the plaque and the clotting process is triggered (see Section 1B.2). The plaque itself  may rupture and break open, and the cholesterol that is released will also cause the platelets to trigger the blood clotting process. A clot may also develop because the endothelial lining is damaged, for example by high blood pressure or smoking.\nA clot that forms in a blood vessel is known as a thrombosis.  \nThe clot can rapidly block the whole blood vessel, particularly if  it is already narrowed by a plaque. A clot that gets stuck in a coronary artery is known as a coronary thrombosis. The clot  can block the artery, starving the heart muscle beyond that point of  oxygen and nutrients, and this often leads to a heart attack  (see fig E).Blargest heart attack\n(cardiac arre st) follows\nif blockage is at C\nmedium heart attack \u2013 death \nof some heart tissue if blockage is at Bsmall heart attack \u2013 death of small amount of heart tissue if blockage is at AABC\n\u25b2 fig E  T he size and severity of a heart attack is closely related to the \nposition of the blockage in the coronary artery.\nDuring a heart attack, there is chest pain in the same areas as in \nan angina attack, but it is much more severe. The pain may occur at any time, although exercise may start it, and it often lasts for several hours. Death may occur very rapidly with no previous symptoms, or it may happen after several days of  feeling tired and suffering symptoms mistaken for indigestion.\nIt is very important to react quickly if  you suspect someone is \nhaving a heart attack. Give them two full-strength aspirin tablets to help stop the blood clotting, and get them to hospital as fast as you can.\nSTROKES\nA stroke is caused by an interruption to the normal blood supply to an area of  the brain. This may be due to bleeding from damaged capillaries or a blockage cutting off  the blood supply to the brain. A blockage is usually caused by a blood clot, an atheroma or a combination of  the two. Sometimes, the blood clot forms somewhere else in the body and is carried in the bloodstream until it gets stuck in an artery in the brain. The damage happens very quickly. A blockage in one of  the main arteries leading to the brain causes a very serious stroke that may lead to death. In one of  the smaller arterioles leading into the brain, the effects may be less disastrous.\nThe symptoms of  strokes vary, depending on how much of  the \nbrain is affected. Very often, the blood is cut off  from one part or one side of  the brain only (see fig F). Symptoms include dizziness, confusion, slurred speech, blurred vision or partial loss of  vision (usually one eye) and numbness. In more severe strokes, there can be paralysis, usually on one side of  the body.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

The healthy part of the brain is shown in blue.\nThe outcome of  either a heart attack or a stroke usually depends \non how soon the person is treated. The sooner the patient is given treatment, including clot-busting drugs that break down or dissolve the blood clot, the more likely they are to survive. For example, if  treatment is given rapidly, 75% of  patients who survive the first week after a heart attack can expect to be alive five years later.\nCHECKPOINT \n1.   W hen a plaque starts to form on the endothelium (lining) of an \nartery, it usually gets worse and worse.

Some of  these diseases \naffect you randomly \u2013 there is nothing you can do to change whether you are affected or not. However, for many diseases, especially non-communicable (non-infectious) conditions such as heart disease \nand cancer, you can increase or lower your risk of  becoming ill, based on factors in your lifestyle. If  you understand the risk factors, you can help to make yourself  and your family healthier.\nWHAT IS RISK?\nThe word risk is used regularly in everyday conversation, but in science it has a very specific meaning. In science, risk describes the probability that an event will happen. Probability means the chance or likelihood of  the event, calculated mathematically. For example, imagine you have six coloured balls \u2013 red, blue, green, yellow, orange and purple \u2013 in a black cloth bag (see fig A). If  you reach in and pull out a single ball, the probability (risk) of  getting, say, a green ball can be expressed in one of  three ways:\n \u20221 in 6\n \u20220.166\n 66 r\necurring (0.17)\n \u202217%.\nT\nhis is the case for any one of  the six colours in the bag. In the same way, it is possible to work out \nyour risk of  developing certain specified diseases or of  dying from a specified cause. \nHOW DO WE PERCEIVE RISK? \nThe actual risk of  doing something is not always the same as the sense of  risk one feels. Most people don\u2019t think twice before getting into their car \u2013 but globally you have an annual risk of  1 in 5747 of  being killed in a road traffic accident. On the other hand, many people get very worried before flying, but commercial flights have a 1 in 4.5\u20135.5\u00a0million risk of  crashing. Personal perception of  risk is based on a variety of  factors which include: \n \u2022ho\nw familiar you are with the activity \n \u2022ho\nw much you enjoy the activity\n \u2022w\nhether or not you approve of  the activity. \nThe actual mathematical risk may play very little part in developing your personal perception of  risk. People often overestimate the benefits, or minimise the risk, of  behaviour that they want to continue. For example, there is now strong evidence from around the world that obesity is linked to a range of  diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers. However, people like eating and so they still become overweight. On the other hand, they will over-emphasise the risks of  activities if  they want to avoid them or prevent others from doing them. For example, parents over-emphasise the risk of  wandering away to small children, to help make the child behave and stay close.\nIn another example, there is good scientific evidence that smoking affects our risk of  developing \ndiseases such as atherosclerosis, as well as lung cancer. However, knowledge of  the mathematical risk of  an early death if  you smoke cigarettes doesn\u2019t always stop people from smoking.\u25b2 fig A  T he risk, chance or \nprobability that you will pick a blue ball out of the black bag is 1 in 6. If\u00a0you return the ball to the bag each time, you will have exactly the same probability of picking a blue ball again the next time. The probability will always be 1\u00a0in 6.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

But the risk is higher for some people than others, depending on their lifestyle and which genes they inherit.\nIt is possible to identify the risk factors that may contribute to \nthe cause of  a disease. Y ou can look at people who have the same factors (e.g. smoking) and compare their risk of  the disease with the average risk for the whole population. Using these techniques, it appears that there are a number of  factors that increase the likelihood that a person will develop atherosclerosis. If  many factors influence your chance of  having a disease, it is called a multifactorial disease. The study of  the patterns of  diseases and their causes is called epidemiology.\nWhen two different sets of  data change together, there may be a \nlink, which is called a correlation. For example, mortality data from a disease such as atherosclerosis may change in a similar pattern to a lifestyle factor such as smoking or lack of  exercise. However, this does not prove that one is the cause of  the other. They could both be caused by something else which would explain why they change in the same way. Correlation is not the same as causation \u2013 further research is always needed to demonstrate a causal link.\nFor example, fig B shows the percentage of  deaths in the  \nUAE from cardiovascular disease each year. It also shows the statistics for obesity and diabetes. This data suggests a possible correlation between obesity and heart disease. \nDeaths from CVD05101520253035404550\nObesePercentage of the population affected\nOverweight Diabetes33%47.5%\n13%31%\n\u25b2 fig B  T his data shows a possible correlation between obesity, diabetes \nand death from cardiovascular disease (CVD).

However, \nthese UAE data agree with findings from countries around the world that suggest obesity is closely linked to the development of  diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Dr Raghib Ali, principle investigator in the UAE Healthy Future Study, has set up a long-term study in Abu Dhabi. The team is aiming to collect the data needed to confirm the pattern of  increased disease risk in the UAE \u2013 and so to find ways of  reducing the risk of  diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\nCHECKPOINT \n1.

Eat fruit and vegetables, drink orange juice, take lots of  exercise, enjoy these foods \u2013 how do we know which advice is based on good science, and which is given to us because someone wants to sell us something? There are many ways in which you can evaluate the design of  studies to decide if  the data are meaningful.\nDESIGNING STUDIES\nMost epidemiological studies are based on a very big sample size \u2013 usually, the bigger the study, the more meaningful the results. \nThe ideal is to investigate one factor or variable, keeping all other \nvariables the same (controlled). However, controlling variables is almost impossible when you are working with human beings. The way people live is complex and varies a lot, so it is hard to detect how any one factor affects people. When a larger number of  people are studied, it is more likely that patterns may emerge, even with all the other differences between the people involved. Evidence based on large amounts of  data is more likely to be statistically significant than evidence based on small studies.\nSome epidemiological studies are carried out over a long time. \nThese longitudinal studies are very valuable because they follow the same group of  individuals over many years (see fig\u00a0A). This means the impact of  their known lifestyle on their health can be tracked over time. For example, the M\u00fcnster Heart Study looked at cardiovascular disease in 10\n 856 men a\nged 36\u201365 in \nEurope, following them from the start of  the study well into the 21st century. The results from this study are still seen as important because so many people were involved over a long period of  time. The Framingham Study in the US also provided much data \u2013 but was limited because they were all from similar American citizens. The study started in 1948 and it is still going on \u2013 the scientists have widened the population they gather data from, so it is more relevant now.\nAn ambitious new study called the National Children\u2019s Study has \nbeen set up in the US to follow 100\n 000 childr\nen from birth until \nthey are 21 years old. From 2008\u20132012, children were selected to be representative of  the whole of  the US population. One major objective of  the study is to examine how environmental inputs and genetic factors interact to affect the health and development of  children. This is believed to be the biggest longitudinal study ever set up. Similarly, the UAE Healthy Future Study will be longitudinal, looking at the same group of  volunteers over a number of  years.\nSometimes, scientists look at all the available studies in a subject \narea and analyse the available data in a massive literature study. This combines small and large studies and can give more reliable evidence than any one of  the studies alone. This is called a metadata analysis (meta-analysis).\nEVALUATING SCIENTIFIC STUDIES\nWhen considering a study, you need to examine the methodology to see if  it is valid. That means that it is properly designed to answer the question or questions being asked. Y ou also need to see if  the measurements have been carried out with precision. It is important to find out if  other scientists have been able to repeat the methodology and have had similar results \u2013 if  so, the results are considered more reliable.\nIt is also important to know who carried out the research, who \nfunded it and where it was published. Then to decide whether or not any of  these factors might have affected or biased the study. Y ou need to evaluate the data and conclusions from the study in the light of  all these factors.\nEXAM HINT\nRemember the meaning of the following terms.\nValid: answers the question the scientists are askingPrecise: measurements with little difference between themReliable: the investigation is repeatable by other scientists who get \nsimilar results\nThey are important in evaluating all practical work and research.\nIn the next few pages, you are going to look at some of  the \nevidence that scientists have collected suggesting factors that may \u2013 or may not \u2013 affect your risk of  developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In each case, you need to look carefully at the type of  evidence that is presented and think about what else you need to know to make firm conclusions.\nRISK FACTORS FOR CVDs\nThe results from many epidemiological studies have identified a range of  risk factors linked to CVDs. These factors divide into two main groups \u2013 those you can\u2019t change and those you can do something about (see Section 1C.3).\nNON-MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS FOR ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nThere are three main risk factors for CVDs which cannot (at the present time) be changed.\n \u2022Genes\n: studies show that there is a genetic tendency (trend) \nin some families, and also in some ethnic groups, to develop CVDs. These trends can include\u2013\n ar\nteries which are easily damaged\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

This can make you more likely \nto suffer from CVDs, particularly heart disease.\n \u2022Gender\n: statistically, under the age of  50, men are more likely \nto suffer from heart disease (and other CVDs) than women. The female hormone oestrogen, which is an important factor in the woman\u2019s menstrual cycle, appears to reduce the build-up of  plaque. This gives women some protection against CVDs until they go through the menopause when oestrogen levels fall.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that risk factors do not cause the disease, they contribute \nto the chances of developing the disease.\nLOOKING AT THE DATA\nIdentical twin studies are an excellent resource when investigating \nwhether there is a genetic factor at work, because identical twins have exactly the same genes. Any differences should therefore be due to the environment in which they live. A major twin study was conducted in Sweden and was based on over 21\n 000 pair\ns of  twins, \nboth identical and non-identical. This study showed that (for male twins) if  one twin died of  heart disease between the ages of  36 and 55, then the risk of  the other twin also dying of  heart disease was eight times higher than if  neither was affected (see fig A). However, as the twins got older, one dying of  heart disease had less of  a correlation with the other twin also dying of  heart disease. In other words, there appears to be a clear genetic link to heart disease in younger men, but it gets less in much older men. \nEpidemiological studies have also identified several lifestyle \nfactors linked to CVDs, some of  which you will look at in the following pages. These lifestyle factors are important for health because they are the factors that we can change.\nCHECKPOINT \nSKILLS EXECUTIVE FUNCTION\n1.

This will help you to understand what the question is asking for.\nMODIFIABLE (LIFESTYLE) RISK FACTORS FOR CVDs\nThe development of  atherosclerosis is linked to many types of  CVD. Y our lifestyle can affect your \nrisk of  developing atherosclerosis in the future. Epidemiological studies have shown links with smoking, diet and weight, lack of  activity and high blood pressure. These are the factors we can change, so we can change our risk of  developing CVDs by the lifestyle choices we make.\nSMOKING AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nStudies have shown that smokers are far more likely to develop atherosclerosis than non-smokers with a similar lifestyle. Nine out of  ten people who need heart bypass surgery or stents as a result of  atherosclerosis are smokers. In 2007, a Spanish study showed a clear correlation between smoking and the incidence of  death from atherosclerotic heart disease. Causation was established by further research. For example, studies found that the substances in tobacco smoke:\n \u2022can dama\nge the artery linings, which makes the build-up of  plaques more likely\n \u2022can cause the ar\nteries to narrow, raise the blood pressure and increase the risk of  atherosclerosis.\nSimilar findings were made in a study on adults with heart disease in Jordan in 2017 (see fig B).1.16 1.12\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

These also lower your risk of  developing atherosclerosis and CVDs. A study of  10\n 269 male Har\nvard University (USA) graduates aged between \n45 and 84 showed that the men who changed from being inactive to taking regular exercise had a 23% lower mortality over the life of  the study than those who did not exercise. Moreover, the main cause of  the deaths was atherosclerosis and the linked CVDs. A study of  72\n 488 f\nemale nurses \nshowed the same benefits for women \u2013 the more active women had a significantly lower risk of  developing atherosclerosis and other CVDs. \nA 2013 study from Sri Lanka showed a similar pattern \u2013 high levels of  inactivity were linked to an \nincreased risk of  obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and CVDs. High levels of  activity were linked to a reduced risk of  all these conditions. Several studies have shown that exercise both reduces the formation of  plaques in the arteries and also keeps plaques that are present more stable and less likely to break.\nHIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nAs you saw in Section 1B.4, the heart pumps blood out into your arteries in a regular rhythm. The blood travels through your arterial system at pressures which change as your heart beats and which are easily measured (see fig C). At systole, when the blood is forced out of  the heart, a healthy blood pressure is around 120\n mmHg\n. When the heart is relaxed and filling during diastole, a healthy blood \npressure is around 80\n mmHg\n. Measuring blood pressure is used as an indicator of  the health of  both \nyour heart and your blood vessels. Y our blood pressure goes up and down naturally during the day \u2013 but it shouldn\u2019t be constantly raised. If  your blood pressure is regularly above 140\/90\n mmHg\n, you \nhave high blood pressure or hypertension. Raised blood pressure can be a sign of  atherosclerosis. The blood pressure goes up when the walls of  the arteries become less flexible due to the build-up of  plaque, and when the lumen of  the arteries get narrower as they are blocked by the plaques. This means that raised blood pressure can be the result of  atherosclerosis and can be used to help diagnose the disease.\n\u25b2 fig C  Doctors can use a blood pr essure monitor like this to check that your blood pressure is in the healthy range. \nSome people buy and use their own monitor, so they can check their blood pressure regularly to help prevent them \ngetting CVDs.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion. Not for resale, circulation or distribution in whole or in part. \u00a9Pearson 2018CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH AND RISK 58 1C.3 RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE\nHowever, other factors can also raise the blood pressure. For \nexample, smoking narrows the blood vessels and raises the blood pressure. Obesity, inactivity, a high level of  salt in the diet and stress can also narrow the arteries or affect the way the heart is pumping and raise the blood pressure. When the blood pressure is constantly high, the lining of  the arteries is more likely to be damaged, leading to atherosclerosis and ultimately CVDs. So high blood pressure can also contribute to CVDs. If  a doctor discovers you have high blood pressure, they will try to help you reduce the level by making lifestyle changes or with medication, to try to reduce your risk of  developing CVDs.\nDIET, OBESITY AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nAn increasing number of  studies suggest that being overweight does not directly affect your risk of  developing CVDs, but it is a very important indicator of  risk. Most scientists think that the best predictors of  future CVDs are: \n \u2022w\nhere fat is stored on your body\n \u2022ho\nw much exercise you do \n \u2022the le\nvels of  different fats in your blood.\nTwo other factors which are often a direct result of  being overweight do increase the risk of  atherosclerosis and CVDs. These are:\n \u2022high b\nlood pressure \u2013 increases the risk of  damage to blood \nvessel linings, and so of  plaque formation\n \u2022type 2 dia\nbetes \u2013 this can result in damage to the lining of  the \nblood vessels which increases the risk of  plaque formation.\nThere have been many studies on how diet is linked to atherosclerosis and CVDs, some looking at general diet, some looking at the role of  diet in becoming overweight or obese, and some looking at specific foods. The evidence is very mixed and very difficult to interpret. Y ou can find out more about this in Section 1C.4.\nEXAM HINT\nRemember that atherosclerosis is a multifactorial disease \u2013 there is no \nsingle cause but there are many factors that contribute to the chances of it occurring. \nSmoking is one important factor that increases the chances of \natherosclerosis. Inactivity and diet are other factors.\nLINKS BETWEEN FACTORS\nMany epidemiological studies are starting to find that an increased \nrisk of  developing a disease is often due to a combination of  factors. For example, it is known that smoking increases your risk of  atherosclerosis because of  its effect on your blood vessels and blood pressure. Evidence now suggests that smoking also changes the balance of  lipoproteins in your blood in a way which raises your risk of  dying from atherosclerosis-related CVDs. Y ou will find out more about lipoproteins and their effect on cardiovascular risk in Section 1C.4.PREVENTING ATHEROSCLEROSIS AND CVDs\nThe advice about what is \u2018good\u2019 for us and what is \u2018bad\u2019 changes. This happens because epidemiological studies of  links between risk factors and CVDs become more sophisticated and scientific research discovers more reasons why some factors can contribute to atherosclerosis. Current evidence suggests that eating a balanced diet with a variety of  fats and plenty of  fruit and vegetables helps prevent atherosclerosis. It helps not to smoke, to maintain a healthy weight to avoid high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, to reduce constant stress and get plenty of  exercise. It is important to take action as early as possible because there is clear evidence of  the early signs of  atherosclerosis in teenagers and even young children, if  known risk factors are already in place.\nCHECKPOINT \n1.

It isn\u2019t just how much you weigh. Doctors and scientists look at your body mass index (BMI) to decide if  you are unhealthily heavy (see fig A).

The normal charts apply to adults only \u2013 there are special charts for children and teenagers. Y oung people grow and their body composition changes as they mature, so both age and gender are important in calculating what is normal until they become adults. The BMI became widely used for deciding whether people are a healthy weight for their height and even for predicting the likelihood of  CVDs \u2013 but doctors increasingly feel it is a very limited tool. Most top athletes would have BMIs in the obese range, because BMI makes no allowance for the difference in composition of  people\u2019s bodies. The reason athletes often have BMIs that suggest they are obese is because BMI does not recognise the difference between fat and muscle. BMI values also underestimate body fat in older people who have lost a lot of  their muscle mass. There are also international differences, with some groups having a greater or lower than average risk of  obesity-related diseases. More and more, the evidence suggests that BMI is not a good predictor of  CVDs on its own \u2013 but combined with other factors it is part of  the picture (see fig B).\naerobically \ufb01t\nun\ufb01t\nBody fat category (% weight as fat)Relative risk of CVD mortality\nlean\n<16.7%normal\n16.7\u201324.9%obese\n>25%01246\n3578\n\u25b2 fig B  T he risk of dying of CVDs differs for people in different weight and \nfitness categories. Being overweight or obese does increase the risk \u2013 but it is not the whole story.\nMEASURING A HEALTHY WEIGHT: THE WAIST-TO-HIP RATIO\nIncreasingly, scientists are finding that a simple waist  :  hip r atio \nis the best measure of  obesity, and also the best way to predict \nan increased risk of  CVDs. The waist is measured just above the navel, and the hips at the widest point of  the hips. The size of  the waist is then divided by the size of  the hips:\n   w\naist size (cm)  _____________   hip size (cm)   \nW\naist size gives a good indication of  the amount of  fat a person  \nis carrying.\nGENDER WAIST  : HIP RA TIO INDICATING OBESITY\nMale >0.9\nFemale >0.85\nA simple measurement like this can be used easily by individuals to monitor their own health and well-being. Simple measures can lower the waist\n :\n hip r\natio. These include eating less and taking more \nexercise to reduce the fat stores and reduce the size of  the waist. Keeping the waist\n :\n hip r\natio at a healthy level reduces your overall \nrisk of  CVDs, as well as the many other conditions linked to obesity.\nBeing seriously underweight is not good for you either and can \nlead to muscle wasting, heart damage and other health problems. However, it is the other end of  the scale that is causing the most concern. The available data show that around 61% of  all adults in England (that\u2019s almost 24\u00a0million people) are either overweight or obese, and that the proportion of  the population affected is continuing to rise. The trend towards obesity is being seen across the developed world. For example, Gulf  Cooperation Council countries face challenges with health problems related to obesity. Saudi Arabia (35.2%), Qatar (33.1%) and UAE (33%) face similar concerns. \nTACKLING OBESITY\nEvidence from around the world suggests that the change in energy balance is linked to modern lifestyles rather than simply to poor individual choices. Energy-rich food is widely available and cheap. The 21st century way of  life in many countries involves almost no exercise \u2013 relatively few jobs now require manual labour, household tasks are often automated and people drive instead of  walking or cycling. So, as the average energy input has increased (or stayed the same), the energy output has decreased and people are gaining weight. Solutions include taxes on fatty foods, town planning to make walking and cycling easier and educating children to prevent childhood obesity \u2013 but there is no clear scientific evidence that any of  these solutions work. One thing we do know \u2013 since 2006, the number of  overweight people in the world is greater than the number of  people who do not get enough to eat. The importance of  reducing obesity is shown in the graph in fig C. This also shows that waist\n :\n hip r\natio is a better \npredictor of  heart disease than BMI.\n45678910Coronary heart disease\nincidence (per 100 people)\nhigh highest low medium\nQuartilewaist-to-hip\nratio\nBMI\n\u25b2 fig C  T his graph shows that as men become more obese, their risk \nof developing coronary heart disease also increases. It also shows that waist\n :\n hip r\natio is a better predictor than BMI.\nDIET AND CVDs\nThe effect of  diet on the risk of  developing CVDs isn\u2019t simply \nabout becoming obese. What you eat, as well as how much you eat, seems to be very important. Many studies have looked at the general diet people eat and at the incidence of  heart disease. For example, one study produced the graph in fig D. This shows that \nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Why do they do this? \nPREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE \nCardiovascular disease has a negative effect on individuals, on families  and on society. It costs a lot of  money to treat people in hospital. When  people are too ill to work, they are losing money for their families, and  also for the companies where they work. Treating people with drugs to  prevent them from needing surgery is cheaper for health service providers.  It is even cheaper (and better for the individual) if  we can stop ourselves  needing the drugs. So, prevention is better than treatment for CVDs for  many reasons (see fig A). However, persuading people to change their  \nlifestyle habits is often difficult.\nFor example, there is a lot of  reliable evidence to show that smoking is  \none of  the highest risk factors for CVDs. However, if  you stop smoking,  your risk of  developing heart disease is almost halved after just one year.  Moreover, research carried out by a team led by Azra Mahmud from  Trinity College Dublin and published in 2007 suggests that after 10 years,  the arteries of  smokers who stop smoking are the same as if  they had  never smoked. There is a lot of  support available for people who want to  stop smoking. Y et, despite all this, almost 1 billion people around the  world smoke cigarettes and millions of  them die each year of  CVDs and  cancers linked to their smoking. \nHealth education programmes in schools and communities can help to  \nmake sure that everyone is aware of  the risks associated with different  lifestyle choices. However, each individual has to make their own choices  and take their own risks.\nOVERWEIGHT OR UNDERFIT?\nMost people are aware that obesity is linked to CVDs, and many go on  slimming diets to try to lose weight. Most people also know that taking  regular exercise helps protect against CVDs \u2013 but more people choose to  go on a diet than choose to take regular exercise. The results of  a study  carried out over an average of  eight years on 20\n 000 men a\nged from  \n30 to 83 years are given in Section 1C.4 fig\u00a0B. Fitness was defined by  how much oxygen they used during exercise. The results show that if  you  are obese and fit you have a lower risk of  dying from CVDs than someone  who is not obese but unfit. Obviously, being the correct weight and fit is  best of  all! \nThe problem is that many people enjoy their food, and don\u2019t take sufficient exercise. It takes a lot of  \neffort to cut down the amount of  food you eat and change to eating healthier foods including lots of  fruit and vegetables. \u25b2\n fig A  Infogr aphics like this one published in Gulf News help \npeople understand the factors which affect their heart health.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember to read all the \ninformation in graphics.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Without water, \nsubstances could not move around the body. Water is one of  the reactants in the process of  photosynthesis, on which almost all life depends (see fig E). Understanding the properties of  water will help you understand many key systems in living organisms. \nWater is also a major habitat \u2013 it supports more life than any other \npart of  the planet.\n\u25b2 fig E  W ater is vital for life on Earth in many different ways \u2013 in a desert, \nthe smallest amount of water allows plants to grow.\nThe simple chemical formula of  water is H2O. This tells us that \ntwo atoms of  hydrogen are joined to one atom of  oxygen to make \nup each water molecule. However, because the electrons are held closer to the oxygen atom than to the hydrogen atoms, water is a polar molecule (see fig F).\n104.5\u00b0O\u03b42\nH\u03b41H\u03b41\n\u25b2 fig F  A model of a w ater molecule showing dipoles.\nOne major effect of  this polarity is that water molecules form hydrogen  bonds. The slightly negative oxygen atom of  one water \nmolecule will attract the slightly positive hydrogen atoms of  other water molecules in a weak electrostatic attraction called a hydrogen \nbond. Each individual hydrogen bond is weak but there are many of  them so the molecules of  water \u2018stick together\u2019 more than you might expect (see fig G). Water has relatively high melting and boiling points compared with other substances that have molecules of  a similar size because it takes a lot of  energy to break all the hydrogen bonds that hold the molecules together. Hydrogen bonds are important in protein structure (see Sections 1A.5 and 2B.1) \nand in the structure and functioning of  DNA (see Section 2B.3).O\u03b42\nO\u03b42\nH\u03b41H\u03b41H\u03b41H\u03b41\nH\u03b41O\u03b42O\u03b42\nO\u03b42H\u03b41\nH\u03b41\nH\u03b41H\u03b41H\u03b41\n\u25b2 fig G  Hydr ogen bonding in water molecules, based on attraction \nbetween positive and negative dipoles.\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF WATER\nThe properties of  water make it very important in biological \nsystems for many reasons.\n \u2022W ater is a polar solvent.

Changing lifestyle, such as improving diet, giving up smoking and taking more exercise can help but there are also various drugs that can be given. The drugs aim to reduce the risks associated with CVDs by helping to prevent problems developing. However, all medicines carry some risk. \nCONTROLLING BLOOD PRESSURE\nAs you have seen, hypertension or high blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.\nANTIHYPERTENSIVES\nDrugs that reduce blood pressure are known as antihypertensives. Some commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs are described below.\n \u2022T\nreatment often begins with diuretics, which increase the volume \nof  urine produced. This eliminates excess fluids and salts, so that the blood volume decreases. With less blood, a smaller volume is pumped from the heart and the blood pressure falls. \n \u2022Beta b\nlockers interfere with the normal system for controlling \nthe heart. They block the response of  the heart to hormones such as adrenaline, which normally act to speed up the heart and increase the blood pressure (you will find out more in Book 2 Topic 7). So, beta blockers make the heart rate slower and the contractions less strong, so the blood pressure is lower.\nSympathetic nerve inhibitors affect the sympathetic nerves which go from your central nervous system to all parts of  your body (you will find out more in Book 2 Topic 7). Sympathetic nerves stimulate your arteries to constrict, which raises your blood pressure. The inhibitors prevent these nerves signalling to the arteries, which helps to keep the arteries dilated and your blood pressure lower.\n \u2022Angiotensin is a hor\nmone which stimulates the constriction of  \nyour blood vessels and so causes the blood pressure to rise. ACE inhibitors block the production of  angiotensin, which reduces the constriction of  your blood vessels and so keeps your blood pressure lower.\nThe benefits of  these drugs in reducing blood pressure are clear. They reduce the risk of  CVDs, and also reduce the risk of  damage to the kidneys and eyes from the high blood pressure. \nBut there are risks. The risks of  these treatments are twofold. \nIf  the treatment is not monitored carefully, your blood pressure may become too low. That can lead to falls and injuries which, particularly in elderly patients, can be serious and even life-threatening. The second major risk is the side-effects that may result from the way your body reacts to the drugs. Each type of  drug has its own possible side-effects (see fig A). For a drug to be given a licence for use, the benefits of  the treatment must be judged to outweigh any side-effects.\nThe side-effects from commonly used antihypertensives include \ncoughs, swelling of  the ankles, impotence, tiredness and fatigue, and constipation. These are not serious compared with the health risks from high blood pressure \u2013 but to the patient they may feel very significant. High blood pressure often doesn\u2019t make you feel ill, but the medication needed to control it can affect your quality of  life. Doctors find many patients stop taking their medication \u2013 the side-effects make them ignore the much larger but invisible risk of  CVDs.\n\u25b2 fig A  All medically licensed drugs c ome with instructions and information \nwhich includes possible side-effects known to be caused by the drug.\nEXAM HINT\nIf you are asked to discuss or evaluate the use of medication or some \nother treatment, you must remember to include both the benefits and the potential risks associated with the treatment.\nSTATINS\nStatins are a group of  drugs that lower the level of  cholesterol in \nyour blood. They block the enzyme in the liver that is responsible for making cholesterol, and are very effective at blocking the production of  LDLs. Statins also improve the balance of  LDLs to HDLs and reduce inflammation in the lining of  the arteries. Both functions reduce the risk of  atherosclerosis developing.\nFig B shows the results from a trial using statins with a group of  6605 \nAsian Indians in the US. This shows the results for men and women, and other groups who are high-risk categories for cardiovascular disease. Statins reduce the incidence of  serious cardiovascular disease in all categories, but they seem to have a greater effect for some groups than for others.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Statins had a strong positive \nbenefit to a range of patients.\nA UK study showed that men who took a particular statin for five \nyears had a lower risk of  death or heart attack, even 10 years after they stopped taking the drug. The study involved 6595 middle-aged men. It showed that for the first five years, the overall risk of  heart attack or death from any type of  heart disease was 11.8% for the men who took the statin, compared with 15.5% for men who took a placebo (an inactive substance that resembles the drug but has no action in the body). The risk was reduced the most while the men were taking the drug, but some level of  protection lasted for up to 10 years afterwards.\nMost people use statins with little or no ill effect. Side-effects of  \nmuscle and joint aches and nausea, constipation and diarrhoea are sometimes reported. However, there are two serious but very rare side-effects. In a tiny number of  people, statins trigger a form of  muscle inflammation which can be fatal. For example, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported 3339 cases of  these muscle reactions between January 1990 and March 2002, but during this time millions of  Americans took statins daily. Statins can also cause liver problems in a small group. As an example, the risk of  liver damage in people taking lovastatin is two in a million. Out of  51\n 741 li\nver transplant patients in the US \nbetween 1990 and 2002, liver failure appeared to be caused by statins in only three cases.\nAnother risk is more subtle: there is a risk that, if  people take \nstatins to lower their blood cholesterol, they will no longer try to eat a healthy diet, and statins give no protection against the other ill effects of  a bad diet.\nPlant stanols and sterols are now widely sold in spreads \nand yoghurts. These compounds are very similar in structure to cholesterol. They reduce the amount of  cholesterol absorbed from your gut into your blood, which can make it easier for your body to metabolise cholesterol and reduce the levels of  LDLs in the blood. Products like these are sold as a food, not as a drug. While there is scientific evidence that they are effective in many people, they have not undergone the levels of  testing that drugs such as statins have. Metadata analysis has shown that these products do work if  they are eaten regularly in the recommended amounts (2\n g \nper da\ny of  plant sterols and stanols). It has been estimated that \nthese products can lower your risk of  heart disease by about 25% if  they are used correctly (see fig C).Plant sterols (g\/d)LDL cholesterol (% change)0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5\n41 trials with plant sterols\/stanols:\n95% Cl from meta-analysisKatan et al.

Here are two examples.\nWarfarin is an anticoagulant that interferes with the \nmanufacture of  prothrombin in the body. Low prothrombin levels make the blood clot less easily (see Section 1B.2). Warfarin has been used in rat poison \u2013 in high doses the blood will not clot at all and the rats bleed to death after the slightest injury. In humans, the dose is carefully monitored to make sure that the clotting of  the blood is reduced but not prevented completely. \nPlatelet inhibitory drugs make the platelets less sticky, and \nso reduce the clotting ability of  the blood. The cheapest and most common of  these is aspirin (fig D) but clopidogrel is also commonly used. \n\u25b2 fig D  Aspirin is a r elatively cheap drug. It has been used traditionally  \nas a painkiller. It is also a very effective way of preventing many \ncardiovascular problems.\nThe risks of  taking aspirin are well known \u2013 it irritates the \nstomach lining and causes bleeding in the stomach which can become serious. A combination of  aspirin and clopidogrel can reduce the risk of  developing a range of  cardiovascular diseases by 20\u201325% in some low-risk patients. However, based on data from several studies it appears that, for some patients, the risk of  side-effects is much higher when the two drugs are combined. For example, for every 1000 patients at high risk of  CVDs treated for 28 months, five cardiovascular events would be avoided \u2013 but three major stomach bleeds would be caused. In lower-risk patients, 23 cardiovascular events would be avoided while 10 major bleeds would be caused. It is difficult to achieve the correct balance between preventing the blood from clotting too easily while allowing it to clot when necessary. For example, when people are treated with anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin, they must be monitored very carefully to make sure that they do not bleed internally, particularly in the brain. The decision whether to give warfarin will depend on many factors, including the patient\u2019s age and condition as well as other medication they may be taking.\nCHECKPOINT \n1.

Changing lifestyle, such as improving diet, giving up smoking and taking more exercise can help but there are also various drugs that can be given. The drugs aim to reduce the risks associated with CVDs by helping to prevent problems developing. However, all medicines carry some risk. \nCONTROLLING BLOOD PRESSURE\nAs you have seen, hypertension or high blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.\nANTIHYPERTENSIVES\nDrugs that reduce blood pressure are known as antihypertensives. Some commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs are described below.\n \u2022T\nreatment often begins with diuretics, which increase the volume \nof  urine produced. This eliminates excess fluids and salts, so that the blood volume decreases. With less blood, a smaller volume is pumped from the heart and the blood pressure falls. \n \u2022Beta b\nlockers interfere with the normal system for controlling \nthe heart. They block the response of  the heart to hormones such as adrenaline, which normally act to speed up the heart and increase the blood pressure (you will find out more in Book 2 Topic 7). So, beta blockers make the heart rate slower and the contractions less strong, so the blood pressure is lower.\nSympathetic nerve inhibitors affect the sympathetic nerves which go from your central nervous system to all parts of  your body (you will find out more in Book 2 Topic 7). Sympathetic nerves stimulate your arteries to constrict, which raises your blood pressure. The inhibitors prevent these nerves signalling to the arteries, which helps to keep the arteries dilated and your blood pressure lower.\n \u2022Angiotensin is a hor\nmone which stimulates the constriction of  \nyour blood vessels and so causes the blood pressure to rise. ACE inhibitors block the production of  angiotensin, which reduces the constriction of  your blood vessels and so keeps your blood pressure lower.\nThe benefits of  these drugs in reducing blood pressure are clear. They reduce the risk of  CVDs, and also reduce the risk of  damage to the kidneys and eyes from the high blood pressure. \nBut there are risks. The risks of  these treatments are twofold. \nIf  the treatment is not monitored carefully, your blood pressure may become too low. That can lead to falls and injuries which, particularly in elderly patients, can be serious and even life-threatening. The second major risk is the side-effects that may result from the way your body reacts to the drugs. Each type of  drug has its own possible side-effects (see fig A). For a drug to be given a licence for use, the benefits of  the treatment must be judged to outweigh any side-effects.\nThe side-effects from commonly used antihypertensives include \ncoughs, swelling of  the ankles, impotence, tiredness and fatigue, and constipation. These are not serious compared with the health risks from high blood pressure \u2013 but to the patient they may feel very significant. High blood pressure often doesn\u2019t make you feel ill, but the medication needed to control it can affect your quality of  life. Doctors find many patients stop taking their medication \u2013 the side-effects make them ignore the much larger but invisible risk of  CVDs.\n\u25b2 fig A  All medically licensed drugs c ome with instructions and information \nwhich includes possible side-effects known to be caused by the drug.\nEXAM HINT\nIf you are asked to discuss or evaluate the use of medication or some \nother treatment, you must remember to include both the benefits and the potential risks associated with the treatment.\nSTATINS\nStatins are a group of  drugs that lower the level of  cholesterol in \nyour blood. They block the enzyme in the liver that is responsible for making cholesterol, and are very effective at blocking the production of  LDLs. Statins also improve the balance of  LDLs to HDLs and reduce inflammation in the lining of  the arteries. Both functions reduce the risk of  atherosclerosis developing.\nFig B shows the results from a trial using statins with a group of  6605 \nAsian Indians in the US. This shows the results for men and women, and other groups who are high-risk categories for cardiovascular disease. Statins reduce the incidence of  serious cardiovascular disease in all categories, but they seem to have a greater effect for some groups than for others.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Statins had a strong positive \nbenefit to a range of patients.\nA UK study showed that men who took a particular statin for five \nyears had a lower risk of  death or heart attack, even 10 years after they stopped taking the drug. The study involved 6595 middle-aged men. It showed that for the first five years, the overall risk of  heart attack or death from any type of  heart disease was 11.8% for the men who took the statin, compared with 15.5% for men who took a placebo (an inactive substance that resembles the drug but has no action in the body). The risk was reduced the most while the men were taking the drug, but some level of  protection lasted for up to 10 years afterwards.\nMost people use statins with little or no ill effect. Side-effects of  \nmuscle and joint aches and nausea, constipation and diarrhoea are sometimes reported. However, there are two serious but very rare side-effects. In a tiny number of  people, statins trigger a form of  muscle inflammation which can be fatal. For example, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported 3339 cases of  these muscle reactions between January 1990 and March 2002, but during this time millions of  Americans took statins daily. Statins can also cause liver problems in a small group. As an example, the risk of  liver damage in people taking lovastatin is two in a million. Out of  51\n 741 li\nver transplant patients in the US \nbetween 1990 and 2002, liver failure appeared to be caused by statins in only three cases.\nAnother risk is more subtle: there is a risk that, if  people take \nstatins to lower their blood cholesterol, they will no longer try to eat a healthy diet, and statins give no protection against the other ill effects of  a bad diet.\nPlant stanols and sterols are now widely sold in spreads \nand yoghurts. These compounds are very similar in structure to cholesterol. They reduce the amount of  cholesterol absorbed from your gut into your blood, which can make it easier for your body to metabolise cholesterol and reduce the levels of  LDLs in the blood. Products like these are sold as a food, not as a drug. While there is scientific evidence that they are effective in many people, they have not undergone the levels of  testing that drugs such as statins have. Metadata analysis has shown that these products do work if  they are eaten regularly in the recommended amounts (2\n g \nper da\ny of  plant sterols and stanols). It has been estimated that \nthese products can lower your risk of  heart disease by about 25% if  they are used correctly (see fig C).Plant sterols (g\/d)LDL cholesterol (% change)0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5\n41 trials with plant sterols\/stanols:\n95% Cl from meta-analysisKatan et al.

This will help you to understand what the question is asking for.\nMODIFIABLE (LIFESTYLE) RISK FACTORS FOR CVDs\nThe development of  atherosclerosis is linked to many types of  CVD. Y our lifestyle can affect your \nrisk of  developing atherosclerosis in the future. Epidemiological studies have shown links with smoking, diet and weight, lack of  activity and high blood pressure. These are the factors we can change, so we can change our risk of  developing CVDs by the lifestyle choices we make.\nSMOKING AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nStudies have shown that smokers are far more likely to develop atherosclerosis than non-smokers with a similar lifestyle. Nine out of  ten people who need heart bypass surgery or stents as a result of  atherosclerosis are smokers. In 2007, a Spanish study showed a clear correlation between smoking and the incidence of  death from atherosclerotic heart disease. Causation was established by further research. For example, studies found that the substances in tobacco smoke:\n \u2022can dama\nge the artery linings, which makes the build-up of  plaques more likely\n \u2022can cause the ar\nteries to narrow, raise the blood pressure and increase the risk of  atherosclerosis.\nSimilar findings were made in a study on adults with heart disease in Jordan in 2017 (see fig B).1.16 1.12\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

These also lower your risk of  developing atherosclerosis and CVDs. A study of  10\n 269 male Har\nvard University (USA) graduates aged between \n45 and 84 showed that the men who changed from being inactive to taking regular exercise had a 23% lower mortality over the life of  the study than those who did not exercise. Moreover, the main cause of  the deaths was atherosclerosis and the linked CVDs. A study of  72\n 488 f\nemale nurses \nshowed the same benefits for women \u2013 the more active women had a significantly lower risk of  developing atherosclerosis and other CVDs. \nA 2013 study from Sri Lanka showed a similar pattern \u2013 high levels of  inactivity were linked to an \nincreased risk of  obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and CVDs. High levels of  activity were linked to a reduced risk of  all these conditions. Several studies have shown that exercise both reduces the formation of  plaques in the arteries and also keeps plaques that are present more stable and less likely to break.\nHIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nAs you saw in Section 1B.4, the heart pumps blood out into your arteries in a regular rhythm. The blood travels through your arterial system at pressures which change as your heart beats and which are easily measured (see fig C). At systole, when the blood is forced out of  the heart, a healthy blood pressure is around 120\n mmHg\n. When the heart is relaxed and filling during diastole, a healthy blood \npressure is around 80\n mmHg\n. Measuring blood pressure is used as an indicator of  the health of  both \nyour heart and your blood vessels. Y our blood pressure goes up and down naturally during the day \u2013 but it shouldn\u2019t be constantly raised. If  your blood pressure is regularly above 140\/90\n mmHg\n, you \nhave high blood pressure or hypertension. Raised blood pressure can be a sign of  atherosclerosis. The blood pressure goes up when the walls of  the arteries become less flexible due to the build-up of  plaque, and when the lumen of  the arteries get narrower as they are blocked by the plaques. This means that raised blood pressure can be the result of  atherosclerosis and can be used to help diagnose the disease.\n\u25b2 fig C  Doctors can use a blood pr essure monitor like this to check that your blood pressure is in the healthy range. \nSome people buy and use their own monitor, so they can check their blood pressure regularly to help prevent them \ngetting CVDs.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

These same bonds are essential in protein \nstructures. In amino acids, tiny negative charges are present on the oxygen of  the carboxyl groups and tiny positive charges are present on the hydrogen atoms of  the amino groups. When these charged groups are close to each other, the opposite charges attract, forming a hydrogen bond. Hydrogen bonds are weak but, potentially, they can be made between any two amino acids in the correct position, so there are many of  them holding the protein together very firmly. They are very important in the folding and coiling of  polypeptide chains (see fig C). Hydrogen bonds break easily and reform if  pH or temperature conditions change.\nDISULFIDE BONDS\nDisulfide bonds form when two cysteine molecules are close together in the structure of  a polypeptide (see fig C). An oxidation reaction occurs between the two sulfur-containing groups, resulting in a strong covalent bond known as a disulfide bond. These disulfide bonds are much stronger than hydrogen bonds but they happen much less often. They are important for holding the folded polypeptide chains in place.\nhydrogen bondhydrogen bond\ndisul\ufb01de bonddisul\ufb01de bond\n\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\n\u25b2 fig C  Hydr ogen bonds and disulfide bonds maintain the shape of protein molecules and this determines  \ntheir function.\nIONIC BONDS\nIonic bonds can form between some of  the strongly positive and negative amino acid side chains \nwhich are sometimes found deep inside the protein molecules. They are strong bonds, but they are not as common as the other structural bonds.\nY our hair is made of  the protein keratin. Some methods of  styling hair change the bonds within the protein \nmolecules. Blow drying or straightening hair breaks the hydrogen bonds and temporarily reforms them with the hair curling in a different way until the hydrogen bonds reform in their original places.\nPerming is a chemical treatment which is used in some hair salons to completely change the way hair \nlooks for weeks or months. The chemicals break the disulfide bonds between the polypeptide chains and reform them in a different place. This effect is permanent \u2013 hair will stay styled in that particular way until it is cut off.\nPROTEIN STRUCTURE\nProteins can be described by their primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure (see fig\u00a0D). \n \u2022T\nhe primary structure of  a protein is the sequence of  amino acids that make up the polypeptide \nchain, held together by peptide bonds.\n \u2022T\nhe secondary structure of  a protein is the arrangement of  the polypeptide chain into a regular, \nrepeating three-dimensional (3D) structure, held together by hydrogen bonds. One example is the right-handed helix (\u03b1-helix), a spiral coil with the peptide bonds forming the backbone and the R\u00a0groups protruding in all directions. Another is the \u00df-pleated sheet, in which the polypeptide chain folds into regular pleats held together by hydrogen bonds between the amino and carboxyl ends of  the amino acids. Most fibrous proteins have this type of  structure. Sometimes there is no regular secondary structure and the polypeptide forms a random coil.LEARNING TIP\nRemember that fibrous proteins \nhave a simpler structure and so tend to be more stable to changes in temperature and pH.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

The amino acid chain, including any \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-pleated sheets, is folded \nfurther into complicated shapes. Hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds and ionic bonds between the R groups of  nearby amino acids hold these 3D shapes in place (see page 17). Globular proteins are an example of  tertiary structures.\n \u2022T\nhe quaternary structure of  a protein is only found in proteins consisting of  two or more \npolypeptide chains. The quaternary structure describes the way these separate polypeptide chains fit together in three dimensions. Examples include some very important enzymes and the blood pigment haemoglobin. \nChanges in conditions such as temperature or pH affect the bonds that keep the 3D shapes of  proteins in place. Even small changes can cause the bonds to break, resulting in the loss of  the 3D shape of  the protein. This is called denaturation. Because the 3D structure of  these proteins is important to the way they work, changing conditions inside the body can cause proteins such as enzymes to stop working properly.\nalanine cysteine\nlysineglycineleucinePrimary structur e the linear sequence\nof amino acids in a peptide.\nTertiary structure the three-dimensional\nfolding of the secondary structur e.\nQuater nary structure the three-dimensional\narrangement of mo re than one tertiary polypeptide.Secondary structur e the repeating\npatter n in the structure  of the peptide\nchains, such as an \u03b1-helix or \u03b2-pleated\nsheets.\n\u25b2 fig D  T he 3D structure of proteins\nFIBROUS AND GLOBULAR PROTEINS\nFIBROUS PROTEINS\nThe complex structures of  large protein molecules relate closely to their functions in the body. Fibrous proteins have little or no tertiary structure. They are long, parallel polypeptide chains with occasional cross-linkages that form them into fibres. They are insoluble in water and are very tough, which makes them ideally suited to their structural functions within organisms. Fibrous proteins appear in the structure of  connective tissue in tendons and the matrix of  bones, as the silk of  spiders\u2019 webs and silkworm cocoons, and as the keratin that makes up hair, nails, horns and feathers.\nCollagen is a fibrous protein that gives strength to tendons, ligaments, bones and skin. It is the most \ncommon structural protein found in animals \u2013 up to 35% of  the protein in your body is collagen. \nCollagen is extremely strong \u2013 the fibres have a tensile strength similar to that of  steel. This is due to the unusual structure of  the collagen molecule. Its quaternary structure has three polypeptide chains, each up to 1000 amino acids long. The primary structure of  these chains is repeating sequences of  glycine with two other amino acids \u2013 often proline and hydroxyproline. The three polypeptide \u03b1-chains are arranged in a unique triple helix, held together by a very large number of  hydrogen \nbonds. Collagen molecules can be up to several millimetres long and are often found together in fibrils that are held together to form collagen fibres. Y ou can see how collagen fibres are built up in fig E.LEARNING TIP\nRemember that the primary \nstructure of proteins is the result of peptide bonds between amino acids. \nThe secondary structure is the \nresult of hydrogen bonding between nearby amino acids but R groups do not affect it. \nIonic bonds, hydrogen bonds \nand disulfide bridges are a result of interactions between the R\u00a0groups and create the tertiary structure.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Biological molecules are often organic compounds. Organic compounds all contain carbon atoms. They also contain atoms of  hydrogen, oxygen and, less frequently, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus. Most of  the material in your body that is not water consists of  these organic molecules. An understanding of  why organic molecules are special will help you to understand the chemistry of  biological molecules including carbohydrates, lipids and proteins.\nEach carbon atom can make four bonds and so it can connect \nto four other atoms. Carbon atoms bond particularly strongly to other carbon atoms to make long chains. The four bonds of  a carbon atom usually form a tetrahedral shape. This means carbon compounds can be rings, branched chains or any number of  three-dimensional (3D) shapes (see fig A). In some carbon compounds small molecules (monomers) bond with many other similar units to make a very large molecule called a polymer. The ability of  carbon to combine and make macromolecules (large molecules) is the basis of  all biological molecules and provides the great variety and complexity found in living things.\nThese two bonds\nare in the plane\nof the paper.\nor more often as:C This bond goesback behind the\nplane of the paper.\nThis bond sticks out ofthe plane of the paper.\ncan be shown with corners representing carbons, and itshydrogens ignored:\nH\nCC\nHHCC\nHH\nHH\nHHC\nHC\nHHCC\nC\nHHC\nHHHH HH\nThis part \nof a chain molecule:\n\u25b2 fig A  T he bonds in a carbon atom have a complicated 3D shape.

They are also important for storing energy and they form an important part of  the cell wall in plants, fungi and bacteria. Sugars and starch are the best known carbohydrates. Sucrose is the familiar white crystalline table sugar; glucose is used as a fuel by the cells of  our bodies. Starch is in rice, flour and potatoes. But the group of  substances called carbohydrates contains many more compounds, as you will discover.\n\u25b2 fig B  Carbohydr ates are important molecules in both plants and animals \n\u2013 and carbohydrate foods like this bread play a major role in the human \ndiet.\nThe basic structure of  all carbohydrates is the same. They consist \nof  carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. There are three main groups of  carbohydrates: monosaccharides, disaccharides and \npolysaccharides. Some have more complex molecules than others (see Section 1A.3).\nMONOSACCHARIDES: THE SIMPLE SUGARS \nMonosaccharides are simple sugars in which there is one oxygen \natom and two hydrogen atoms for each carbon atom in the molecule. A general formula for this can be written (CH\n2O)n. Here \nn can be any number, but it is usually low.\nTriose sugars (n = 3) have three carbon atoms and the general \nformula C3H6O3.

To show this, you can use displayed formulae.

The arrangement of the atoms \non the side chains can make a significant difference to the way in which the molecule can be used by the body. The carbon atoms are numbered in order to identify the different arrangements.\nGlucose has two isomers (different forms): \u03b1-glucose and \n\u03b2-glucose. The two isomers have different arrangements of  the atoms on the side chains of  the molecule. The\u00a0different isomers form different bonds between neighbouring glucose molecules, and this affects the polymers that are made. Y ou will learn more about \u03b1- and \u03b2-glucose in Section 4A.5.\nDID YOU KNOW? \nHydrogenating some sugars reduces the energy they provide. When glucose is hydrogenated, it forms sorbitol (C\n6H14O6). Sorbitol \ntastes up to 60% sweeter than glucose but it provides less energy when it is used in the body (11\n kJg\u22121 compared to 17  kJg\u22121). The \ncombination of the very sweet taste and the lower energy count makes it useful as a sweetener for people who want to lose weight. A small change in the chemical structure has a big effect on function.\nDISACCHARIDES: THE DOUBLE SUGARS\nDisaccharides consist of  two monosaccharides joined together \u2013 for example sucrose (table sugar) is formed by a molecule of  \u03b1-glucose joining with a molecule of  fructose. Two monosaccharides join in a condensation reaction to form a disaccharide, and a molecule of  water (H\n2O) is released. The \nlink between the two monosaccharides results in a covalent bond known as a glycosidic bond (see fig E). We use numbers to show which carbon atoms are involved in the bond. If  carbon 1 on one monosaccharide joins to carbon 4 on another monosaccharide, we call it a 1,4-glycosidic bond. If  the bond is between carbon 1 and carbon 6, it is a 1,6-glycosidic bond.\nH\nHOH\nOHO\n1 46\n2 35\n1,4-glycosidic bondH\nHOOHH O\n1 4\n2 356\nH\nHOH O\n1 4\n2 356\nH\nOOHH O\n1 4\n2 356\nmaltosecondensation\nH2O\u03b1-glucose \u03b1-glucose\n\u25b2 fig E  T he formation of a glycosidic bond.

They are made of  many monosaccharide units \njoined by condensation reactions that create glycosidic bonds (see Section\u00a01A.2 fig E). Polysaccharides \ndo not have the sweet taste of  many mono- and disaccharides, but these complex polymers include some very important biological molecules.\nMolecules with between 3 and 10 sugar units are known as oligosaccharides, while molecules \ncontaining 11 or more monosaccharides are known as true polysaccharides. The glycosidic bonds in the polysaccharide can be broken to release monosaccharide units for cellular respiration.\nThe glycosidic bond between two glucose units is split by a process known as hydrolysis (see fig\u00a0A).  \nThe hydrolysis reaction is the opposite of  the condensation reaction that created the molecule, so water \nis added to the bond. Starch and glycogen are gradually broken down into shorter and shorter chains and eventually single sugars are left. Disaccharides break down to form two monosaccharides. Hydrolysis takes place during digestion in the gut, and also in the muscle and liver cells when the carbohydrate stores are broken down to release sugars for use in cellular respiration (see Book 2 Chapter 7A).\nH\nHOH\nOHO\n1 46\n2 35\n1,4-glycosidic bondH\nHO OHH O\n1 4\n2 356\nH\nHOH O\n1 4\n2 356H\nOOHH O\n1 4\n2 356\nmaltosecondensation hydrolysis\nH2O H2O\u03b1-glucose \u03b1-glucose\n\u25b2 fig A  Gly cosidic bonds are made by condensation reactions and broken down by hydrolysis.\nCARBOHYDRATES AND ENERGY \nMONOSACCHARIDES AND DISACCHARIDES\nEvery chemical reaction taking place in a cell needs energy. This energy is supplied by a substance \ncalled adenosine triphosphate, ATP . This ATP comes from the breakdown of  the monosaccharide \nglucose, using oxygen, in the process of  cellular respiration. Y ou will learn much more about cellular respiration later in your course in Book 2 Chapter 7A. \nThe arrangement of  atoms in a molecule of  \u03b1-glucose means that it can be broken down completely \nin a series of  reactions, if  oxygen is available. The compounds that are produced, called the end products, are waste carbon dioxide and water, and lots of  ATP . This supplies the energy needed for all the reactions in the cell. LEARNING TIP\nGlycosidic bonds are formed \nwith the removal of a molecule of water in condensation reactions. \nGlycosidic bonds are broken \nwith the addition of a molecule of water in hydrolysis reactions.\nEXAM HINT\nBe careful not to say that this produces or creates energy for cell processes. Energy cannot be created \u2013 it is converted from one form to another. Here, chemical energy is transferred from the glucose molecule to the ATP molecules.LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n \u25fcKnow the diff erence between monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides, including glycogen and starch.\n \u25fcExplain how monosaccharides join to f\norm polysaccharides through condensation reactions forming glycosidic \nbonds, and how these can be split through hydrolysis reactions.\n \u25fcR\nelate the structures of monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides to their roles in providing and  \nstoring energy.1.4 CP1 1.3 1.2(ii) 1.2(i)\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Other monosaccharides and disaccharides \u2013 for example, fructose, maltose and sucrose \u2013 are also easily absorbed in the body and rapidly converted to glucose. So foods containing monosaccharides and disaccharides are a good source of  relatively instant energy (see fig B). However, these cannot be used to store energy because they are chemically active, and they are very soluble in water, so they affect the water balance of  the cells. Y ou will find out why that is so important in Chapter 2A.\n\u25b2 fig B  T hese medjool dates contain a lot of fructose. That is why they taste \nso sweet and give you instant energy.\nPOLYSACCHARIDES\nThe structure of  polysaccharides makes them ideal as energy \nstorage molecules within a cell.\n \u2022T\nhey can form very compact molecules, which take up little space.\n \u2022T\nhey are physically and chemically inactive, so they do not \ninterfere with the other functions of  the cell.\n \u2022T\nhey are not very soluble in water, so have almost no  \neffect on water potential within a cell and cause no  osmotic water movements.\nSTARCH\nStarch is particularly important as an energy store in plants. The sugars produced by photosynthesis are rapidly converted into starch, which is insoluble and compact but can be broken down rapidly to release glucose when it is needed. Storage organs such as sweet potatoes (yams) are particularly rich in starch. Y ou will find out a lot more about the importance of  starch in plants in Chapter 4A of  this book.\nStarch consists of  long chains of  \u03b1-glucose. But if  you look at it \nmore closely you will see that it is a mixture of  two compounds:\n \u2022Amylose\n: an unbranched polymer of  between 200 and 5000 \nglucose units. As the chain lengthens the molecule spirals, which makes it more compact for storage.\n \u2022Amylopectin\n: a branched polymer of  glucose units. The \nbranching chains have many terminal glucose units that can be broken off  rapidly when energy is needed.\nAmylose and amylopectin are both long chains of  \u03b1-glucose units \u2013 so why are the molecules so different? It all depends on the carbon atoms involved in the glycosidic bonds.\nAmylose has only 1,4-glycosidic bonds, which is why the \nmolecules are long unbranched\u00a0chains.\nIn amylopectin, many of  the glucose molecules are joined by \n1,4-glycosidic bonds, but there are also a few 1,6-glycosidic bonds. This results in the branching chains that change the properties of  the molecule.EXAM HINT\nBe sure you can relate the structure of the molecule to its function as \na storage molecule.\nCoiling makes it compact so it takes up less space and doesn\u2019t get in \nthe way of organelles or substances moving around the cell.\nLarge molecules are insoluble so they do not interfere with the water \npotential of the cell.\nPRACTICAL SKILLS CP1\nTesting for starch\nIf you add a few drops of reddish-brown iodine solution to a sample \ncontaining starch (whether it is a solid sample or a sample in solution), the iodine solution will turn blue-black (see fig C).\nStarch has a combination of  straight-chain amylose and branched-\nchain amylopectin molecules (see fig D). This combination explains why carbohydrate foods like rice and pasta are so good for you when you are doing sport or hard physical work. The amylopectin releases glucose for cellular respiration rapidly when\u00a0needed. Amylose releases glucose more slowly over time, keeping you going longer.\namyloseside group\nthis chain forms a spiralH\n1 41\n414\n1\n4\n1\n6\n1\n441 44 1\nHOO\nOO\nOO\nO OO\namylopectin\n1,6-glycosidic bond\n1,4-glycosidic bondH\nHOO\nOO\nOO\nO H\nHOO\nOO\nOOO\nO\nO\nOO\n\u25b2 fig D  Amylose and amylopectin \u2014 a small differ ence in the position \nof the glycosidic bonds in the molecule makes a big difference to the \nproperties of the compounds.\n\u25c0 fig C  T he iodine test for starch\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

It is also an important storage carbohydrate in fungi. Chemically, glycogen is very similar to the amylopectin molecules in starch, and it also has many \u03b1-glucose units. Like starch, it is very compact, but the glycogen molecule has more 1,6-glycosidic bonds than the starch molecule, giving it many side branches. This means that glycogen can be broken down very rapidly. This makes it an ideal source of  glucose for animals which may require rapid release of  energy at certain times of  high activity levels (see fig E). \nnucleus\nglycogen \ngranules\nCH2OH\nO\nOOH\nHHOH\nOH\nOHH H\nOH HCH2OH\nO\nOHHHOHH H\n1\n6\n5\n414\n32CH2OH\nO\nOOH\nHH\nOHOHH HH HCH2OH\nO\nOH\nHH\nOHH H\nOHCH2\nO\nOH\nHH\nOHH H\nOHCH2OH\nO\nOH\nHH\nOHH H\nOHCH2OH\nO\nOH\nHH\nOHH H\n\u25b2 fig E  In (a)  you can see liver cells full of small glycogen granules, stained pink in this micrograph.

They are an \nintegral part of  all cell membranes and are also used as an energy store. Lipids contain many carbon\u2013\nhydrogen bonds and almost no oxygen. When lipids are oxidised in the respiration process, the bonds are broken and carbon dioxide and water are the final products. This reaction can be used to drive the production of  much ATP (see Sections 1A.3, 2A.2 and 2A.4 and Book 2 Chapter 5A). Lipids, \nespecially triglycerides, store about three times as much energy as the same mass of  carbohydrates. Many plants and animals convert spare food into oils or fats as an energy store to use when needed. For example, the seeds of  plants contain lipids to provide energy for the seedling when it starts to grow, which is why seeds are such an important food source for many animals.\nFATS AND OILS\nFats and oils are important groups of  lipids. Chemically they are very similar, but fats such as butter are solids at room temperature whereas oils such as olive oil are liquids (see fig A). Fats come mainly from animal sources while oils are mainly from plant sources.\nLike carbohydrates, the chemical elements that all lipid molecules contain are carbon, hydrogen and \noxygen. However, lipids contain a much lower proportion of  oxygen than carbohydrates. Fats and oils contain two types of  organic chemical substance, fatty acids and glycerol (propane-1,2,3-triol). These are combined using ester bonds. Glycerol has the chemical formula C\n3H8O3 (see fig B).\nAll fatty acids have a long hydrocarbon chain \u2013 a folded backbone of  carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms attached, and a carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) at one end. Living tissues contain more than 70 different types of  fatty acid. Fatty acids vary in two ways:\n \u2022the length of\n the carbon chain can differ (but is often 15\u201317 carbon atoms long)\n \u2022the f\natty acid may be a saturated fatty acid or an unsaturated fatty acid.\nIn a saturated fatty acid, each carbon atom is joined to the one next to it by a single covalent bond. A common example is stearic acid (see fig C). In an unsaturated fatty acid, the carbon chains have one or more double covalent bonds between carbon atoms in them. A monounsaturated fatty acid has one carbon\u2013carbon double bond and a polyunsaturated fatty acid has more than one carbon\u2013carbon double bond (see fig\u00a0D). Linoleic acid is an example of  a polyunsaturated fatty acid.

A bond is formed in a condensation \nreaction between the carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) of  a fatty acid and one of  the hydroxyl groups (\u2013OH) of  the glycerol. A molecule of  water is removed and the bond created is called an ester bond. This type of  condensation reaction is called esterification (see fig\u00a0E). The nature of  the lipid formed depends on \nwhich fatty acids are joined together. For example, lipids containing saturated fatty acids are more likely to be solid at room temperature than those containing unsaturated fatty acids.

Proteins make \nhair, skin and nails, the enzymes needed for metabolism and digestion, and many of  the hormones that control the different body systems. They enable muscle fibres to contract, make antibodies that protect you from disease, help clot your blood and transport oxygen in the form of  haemoglobin. Understanding the structure of  proteins helps you understand the detailed biology of  cells and organisms. Like carbohydrates and lipids, proteins contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. In addition, they all contain nitrogen and many proteins also contain sulfur.\nProteins are a group of  macromolecules made up of  many \nsmall monomer units called amino acids joined together by condensation reactions. Amino acids combine in long chains to produce proteins. There are about 20 different naturally occurring amino acids that can combine in different ways to produce a wide range of  different proteins.\nAMINO ACIDS\nAll amino acids have the same basic structure, which is represented as a general formula. There is always an amino group (\u2013NH\n2) and a carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) attached to a carbon \natom (see fig A). The group known as the R group varies between amino acids. Some amino acids contain sulfur and selenium in their R group. The R groups are not involved in the reactions which join the amino acids together, but the structure of  the R group does affect the way the amino acid interacts with others within the protein molecule. This will mainly depend on whether the R\u00a0group is polar or not, and these interactions affect the tertiary structure of  the protein formed (see page 18).\nThis part is common \nto all amino acids and \nis just shown as a \nshaded rectangle in the examples below.general formula\nglycine cysteineN HR\nH HCC OH\nO\nHC H2SH\n \n\u25b2 fig A  Some differ ent amino acids.

They join in a condensation reaction and a molecule of  water is released. A peptide bond is formed when two amino acids join, and a dipeptide is the result (see fig B). The R group is not involved in this reaction. More and more amino acids join to form polypeptide chains, which contain from about 100 to many thousands of  amino acids. A polypeptide forms a protein when the structure of  the chain changes by folding or coiling or associates with other polypeptide chains.\namino acid 1\ndipeptidepeptide\nbondamino acid 2 (inverted)\nOH + OH N H\nH HCC\nON HHH\nCCO\nOH N H\nH HC C\nONHH\nCCOcondensation hydrolysisR1\nR1R2\nR2H2O H2O\n\u25b2 fig B  Amino acids ar e the building blocks of proteins, joined together  \nby peptide bonds.\nBONDS IN PROTEINS\nThe peptide bond between amino acids is a strong bond. Other \nbonds are also made between the amino acids in a chain, to create the 3D structures of  the protein. They depend on the atoms in the R group and include hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds and ionic bonds.2.6(iv) CP2 2.6(iii) 2.6(ii) 2.6(i)\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

These same bonds are essential in protein \nstructures. In amino acids, tiny negative charges are present on the oxygen of  the carboxyl groups and tiny positive charges are present on the hydrogen atoms of  the amino groups. When these charged groups are close to each other, the opposite charges attract, forming a hydrogen bond. Hydrogen bonds are weak but, potentially, they can be made between any two amino acids in the correct position, so there are many of  them holding the protein together very firmly. They are very important in the folding and coiling of  polypeptide chains (see fig C). Hydrogen bonds break easily and reform if  pH or temperature conditions change.\nDISULFIDE BONDS\nDisulfide bonds form when two cysteine molecules are close together in the structure of  a polypeptide (see fig C). An oxidation reaction occurs between the two sulfur-containing groups, resulting in a strong covalent bond known as a disulfide bond. These disulfide bonds are much stronger than hydrogen bonds but they happen much less often. They are important for holding the folded polypeptide chains in place.\nhydrogen bondhydrogen bond\ndisul\ufb01de bonddisul\ufb01de bond\n\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\n\u25b2 fig C  Hydr ogen bonds and disulfide bonds maintain the shape of protein molecules and this determines  \ntheir function.\nIONIC BONDS\nIonic bonds can form between some of  the strongly positive and negative amino acid side chains \nwhich are sometimes found deep inside the protein molecules. They are strong bonds, but they are not as common as the other structural bonds.\nY our hair is made of  the protein keratin. Some methods of  styling hair change the bonds within the protein \nmolecules. Blow drying or straightening hair breaks the hydrogen bonds and temporarily reforms them with the hair curling in a different way until the hydrogen bonds reform in their original places.\nPerming is a chemical treatment which is used in some hair salons to completely change the way hair \nlooks for weeks or months. The chemicals break the disulfide bonds between the polypeptide chains and reform them in a different place. This effect is permanent \u2013 hair will stay styled in that particular way until it is cut off.\nPROTEIN STRUCTURE\nProteins can be described by their primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure (see fig\u00a0D). \n \u2022T\nhe primary structure of  a protein is the sequence of  amino acids that make up the polypeptide \nchain, held together by peptide bonds.\n \u2022T\nhe secondary structure of  a protein is the arrangement of  the polypeptide chain into a regular, \nrepeating three-dimensional (3D) structure, held together by hydrogen bonds. One example is the right-handed helix (\u03b1-helix), a spiral coil with the peptide bonds forming the backbone and the R\u00a0groups protruding in all directions. Another is the \u00df-pleated sheet, in which the polypeptide chain folds into regular pleats held together by hydrogen bonds between the amino and carboxyl ends of  the amino acids. Most fibrous proteins have this type of  structure. Sometimes there is no regular secondary structure and the polypeptide forms a random coil.LEARNING TIP\nRemember that fibrous proteins \nhave a simpler structure and so tend to be more stable to changes in temperature and pH.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

The amino acid chain, including any \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-pleated sheets, is folded \nfurther into complicated shapes. Hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds and ionic bonds between the R groups of  nearby amino acids hold these 3D shapes in place (see page 17). Globular proteins are an example of  tertiary structures.\n \u2022T\nhe quaternary structure of  a protein is only found in proteins consisting of  two or more \npolypeptide chains. The quaternary structure describes the way these separate polypeptide chains fit together in three dimensions. Examples include some very important enzymes and the blood pigment haemoglobin. \nChanges in conditions such as temperature or pH affect the bonds that keep the 3D shapes of  proteins in place. Even small changes can cause the bonds to break, resulting in the loss of  the 3D shape of  the protein. This is called denaturation. Because the 3D structure of  these proteins is important to the way they work, changing conditions inside the body can cause proteins such as enzymes to stop working properly.\nalanine cysteine\nlysineglycineleucinePrimary structur e the linear sequence\nof amino acids in a peptide.\nTertiary structure the three-dimensional\nfolding of the secondary structur e.\nQuater nary structure the three-dimensional\narrangement of mo re than one tertiary polypeptide.Secondary structur e the repeating\npatter n in the structure  of the peptide\nchains, such as an \u03b1-helix or \u03b2-pleated\nsheets.\n\u25b2 fig D  T he 3D structure of proteins\nFIBROUS AND GLOBULAR PROTEINS\nFIBROUS PROTEINS\nThe complex structures of  large protein molecules relate closely to their functions in the body. Fibrous proteins have little or no tertiary structure. They are long, parallel polypeptide chains with occasional cross-linkages that form them into fibres. They are insoluble in water and are very tough, which makes them ideally suited to their structural functions within organisms. Fibrous proteins appear in the structure of  connective tissue in tendons and the matrix of  bones, as the silk of  spiders\u2019 webs and silkworm cocoons, and as the keratin that makes up hair, nails, horns and feathers.\nCollagen is a fibrous protein that gives strength to tendons, ligaments, bones and skin. It is the most \ncommon structural protein found in animals \u2013 up to 35% of  the protein in your body is collagen. \nCollagen is extremely strong \u2013 the fibres have a tensile strength similar to that of  steel. This is due to the unusual structure of  the collagen molecule. Its quaternary structure has three polypeptide chains, each up to 1000 amino acids long. The primary structure of  these chains is repeating sequences of  glycine with two other amino acids \u2013 often proline and hydroxyproline. The three polypeptide \u03b1-chains are arranged in a unique triple helix, held together by a very large number of  hydrogen \nbonds. Collagen molecules can be up to several millimetres long and are often found together in fibrils that are held together to form collagen fibres. Y ou can see how collagen fibres are built up in fig E.LEARNING TIP\nRemember that the primary \nstructure of proteins is the result of peptide bonds between amino acids. \nThe secondary structure is the \nresult of hydrogen bonding between nearby amino acids but R groups do not affect it. \nIonic bonds, hydrogen bonds \nand disulfide bridges are a result of interactions between the R\u00a0groups and create the tertiary structure.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

They fold into \nspherical (globular) shapes. The character of  the R groups on the amino acids plays an important role in the formation of  globular proteins. Some R groups are hydrophobic. They repel water and will not mix or dissolve in it. They are usually found on the inside of  globular proteins. Some R groups are hydrophilic \u2013 they have an affinity for water. These groups tend to be found on the outside of  globular proteins. The large size of  these globular protein molecules affects their behaviour in water. \nThe carboxyl and amino ends give them ionic properties, so you might expect them to dissolve in \nwater and form a solution. Instead, the molecules are so big that they form a colloid. In a colloid, microscopic particles of  one substance (in this case protein) are suspended throughout another substance (in this case water). They do not settle, and they cannot easily be separated. Globular proteins are important as they hold molecules in position in the cytoplasm. Globular proteins are also important in your immune system \u2013 for example, antibodies are globular proteins. Enzymes and some hormones are globular proteins and help maintain the structure of  the cytoplasm (you will learn more about globular proteins as enzymes in Sections 2B.1 and 2B.2).\nHaemoglobin is one of  the best known globular proteins. It is a very large molecule with 574 amino \nacids arranged in four polypeptide chains which are connected by disulfide bonds. Each polypeptide chain surrounds an iron-containing haem group (see fig F). The iron enables the haemoglobin to bind and release oxygen molecules, and the arrangement of  the polypeptide chains determines how easily the oxygen binds or is released (see Section 1B.2 to find out how haemoglobin takes up and gives up oxygen in the tissues of  your body).\nEach polypeptide holds one\niron-containing haem group.Each haem group transportsone oxygen molecule.4 polypeptide chainsbond together to makethe globular structur\ne\nof haemoglobin.\n\u25b2 fig F  T he complex quaternary structure of haemoglobin produces a globular protein containing four haem groups \nwhich can carry oxygen to the tissues of the body.LEARNING TIP\nRemember that fibrous proteins \nare more stable than globular proteins and tend to create structures rather than being metabolically active.\nEXAM HINT\nGlobular proteins have a specific 3D shape which means they can be metabolically active as enzymes or hormones.

Some protein molecules \nare joined with (conjugated to) another molecule called a prosthetic group (see fig\u00a0F). This structural feature usually affects the performance and functions of  the molecules. These molecules are called conjugated proteins. Haemoglobin is a large protein with iron as the prosthetic group. It is a conjugated protein as well as a globular protein. Lipoproteins are formed when proteins are conjugated with lipids \u2013 you will find out more about these important biological molecules when you look at factors affecting the health of  your heart in Chapter 1B.\nGlycoproteins are proteins with a carbohydrate prosthetic group. The carbohydrate part of  the \nmolecule helps them to hold a lot of  water and also makes it harder for protein-digesting enzymes (proteases) to break them down. Lots of  lubricants used by the human body \u2013 such as mucus and the synovial fluid in the joints \u2013 are glycoproteins. Their water-holding properties make them slippery and viscous, which reduces friction. This also helps to explain why the mucus produced in the stomach protects the protein walls from digestion.\nLipoproteins are very important in the transport of  cholesterol in the blood. The lipid part of  the \nmolecule enables it to combine with the lipid cholesterol. There are two main forms of  lipoproteins in your blood \u2013 low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) (around 22\n nm in diameter) and high-density \nlipopr\noteins (HDLs) (approximately 8\u201311\n nm in diameter). T\nhe HDLs contain more protein than \nLDLs, which is partly why they are denser \u2013 proteins are more compact molecules than lipids. Y ou will discover the impact of  different lipoproteins on the risk of  developing cardiovascular diseases  in Section 1C.4.\nPRACTICAL SKILLS CP2\nEXAM HINT\nRemember that amino acids are joined together by peptide bonds to make dipeptides and then \npolypeptides.

Proteins make \nhair, skin and nails, the enzymes needed for metabolism and digestion, and many of  the hormones that control the different body systems. They enable muscle fibres to contract, make antibodies that protect you from disease, help clot your blood and transport oxygen in the form of  haemoglobin. Understanding the structure of  proteins helps you understand the detailed biology of  cells and organisms. Like carbohydrates and lipids, proteins contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. In addition, they all contain nitrogen and many proteins also contain sulfur.\nProteins are a group of  macromolecules made up of  many \nsmall monomer units called amino acids joined together by condensation reactions. Amino acids combine in long chains to produce proteins. There are about 20 different naturally occurring amino acids that can combine in different ways to produce a wide range of  different proteins.\nAMINO ACIDS\nAll amino acids have the same basic structure, which is represented as a general formula. There is always an amino group (\u2013NH\n2) and a carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) attached to a carbon \natom (see fig A). The group known as the R group varies between amino acids. Some amino acids contain sulfur and selenium in their R group. The R groups are not involved in the reactions which join the amino acids together, but the structure of  the R group does affect the way the amino acid interacts with others within the protein molecule. This will mainly depend on whether the R\u00a0group is polar or not, and these interactions affect the tertiary structure of  the protein formed (see page 18).\nThis part is common \nto all amino acids and \nis just shown as a \nshaded rectangle in the examples below.general formula\nglycine cysteineN HR\nH HCC OH\nO\nHC H2SH\n \n\u25b2 fig A  Some differ ent amino acids.

They join in a condensation reaction and a molecule of  water is released. A peptide bond is formed when two amino acids join, and a dipeptide is the result (see fig B). The R group is not involved in this reaction. More and more amino acids join to form polypeptide chains, which contain from about 100 to many thousands of  amino acids. A polypeptide forms a protein when the structure of  the chain changes by folding or coiling or associates with other polypeptide chains.\namino acid 1\ndipeptidepeptide\nbondamino acid 2 (inverted)\nOH + OH N H\nH HCC\nON HHH\nCCO\nOH N H\nH HC C\nONHH\nCCOcondensation hydrolysisR1\nR1R2\nR2H2O H2O\n\u25b2 fig B  Amino acids ar e the building blocks of proteins, joined together  \nby peptide bonds.\nBONDS IN PROTEINS\nThe peptide bond between amino acids is a strong bond. Other \nbonds are also made between the amino acids in a chain, to create the 3D structures of  the protein. They depend on the atoms in the R group and include hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds and ionic bonds.2.6(iv) CP2 2.6(iii) 2.6(ii) 2.6(i)\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

These same bonds are essential in protein \nstructures. In amino acids, tiny negative charges are present on the oxygen of  the carboxyl groups and tiny positive charges are present on the hydrogen atoms of  the amino groups. When these charged groups are close to each other, the opposite charges attract, forming a hydrogen bond. Hydrogen bonds are weak but, potentially, they can be made between any two amino acids in the correct position, so there are many of  them holding the protein together very firmly. They are very important in the folding and coiling of  polypeptide chains (see fig C). Hydrogen bonds break easily and reform if  pH or temperature conditions change.\nDISULFIDE BONDS\nDisulfide bonds form when two cysteine molecules are close together in the structure of  a polypeptide (see fig C). An oxidation reaction occurs between the two sulfur-containing groups, resulting in a strong covalent bond known as a disulfide bond. These disulfide bonds are much stronger than hydrogen bonds but they happen much less often. They are important for holding the folded polypeptide chains in place.\nhydrogen bondhydrogen bond\ndisul\ufb01de bonddisul\ufb01de bond\n\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\n\u25b2 fig C  Hydr ogen bonds and disulfide bonds maintain the shape of protein molecules and this determines  \ntheir function.\nIONIC BONDS\nIonic bonds can form between some of  the strongly positive and negative amino acid side chains \nwhich are sometimes found deep inside the protein molecules. They are strong bonds, but they are not as common as the other structural bonds.\nY our hair is made of  the protein keratin. Some methods of  styling hair change the bonds within the protein \nmolecules. Blow drying or straightening hair breaks the hydrogen bonds and temporarily reforms them with the hair curling in a different way until the hydrogen bonds reform in their original places.\nPerming is a chemical treatment which is used in some hair salons to completely change the way hair \nlooks for weeks or months. The chemicals break the disulfide bonds between the polypeptide chains and reform them in a different place. This effect is permanent \u2013 hair will stay styled in that particular way until it is cut off.\nPROTEIN STRUCTURE\nProteins can be described by their primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure (see fig\u00a0D). \n \u2022T\nhe primary structure of  a protein is the sequence of  amino acids that make up the polypeptide \nchain, held together by peptide bonds.\n \u2022T\nhe secondary structure of  a protein is the arrangement of  the polypeptide chain into a regular, \nrepeating three-dimensional (3D) structure, held together by hydrogen bonds. One example is the right-handed helix (\u03b1-helix), a spiral coil with the peptide bonds forming the backbone and the R\u00a0groups protruding in all directions. Another is the \u00df-pleated sheet, in which the polypeptide chain folds into regular pleats held together by hydrogen bonds between the amino and carboxyl ends of  the amino acids. Most fibrous proteins have this type of  structure. Sometimes there is no regular secondary structure and the polypeptide forms a random coil.LEARNING TIP\nRemember that fibrous proteins \nhave a simpler structure and so tend to be more stable to changes in temperature and pH.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

The amino acid chain, including any \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-pleated sheets, is folded \nfurther into complicated shapes. Hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds and ionic bonds between the R groups of  nearby amino acids hold these 3D shapes in place (see page 17). Globular proteins are an example of  tertiary structures.\n \u2022T\nhe quaternary structure of  a protein is only found in proteins consisting of  two or more \npolypeptide chains. The quaternary structure describes the way these separate polypeptide chains fit together in three dimensions. Examples include some very important enzymes and the blood pigment haemoglobin. \nChanges in conditions such as temperature or pH affect the bonds that keep the 3D shapes of  proteins in place. Even small changes can cause the bonds to break, resulting in the loss of  the 3D shape of  the protein. This is called denaturation. Because the 3D structure of  these proteins is important to the way they work, changing conditions inside the body can cause proteins such as enzymes to stop working properly.\nalanine cysteine\nlysineglycineleucinePrimary structur e the linear sequence\nof amino acids in a peptide.\nTertiary structure the three-dimensional\nfolding of the secondary structur e.\nQuater nary structure the three-dimensional\narrangement of mo re than one tertiary polypeptide.Secondary structur e the repeating\npatter n in the structure  of the peptide\nchains, such as an \u03b1-helix or \u03b2-pleated\nsheets.\n\u25b2 fig D  T he 3D structure of proteins\nFIBROUS AND GLOBULAR PROTEINS\nFIBROUS PROTEINS\nThe complex structures of  large protein molecules relate closely to their functions in the body. Fibrous proteins have little or no tertiary structure. They are long, parallel polypeptide chains with occasional cross-linkages that form them into fibres. They are insoluble in water and are very tough, which makes them ideally suited to their structural functions within organisms. Fibrous proteins appear in the structure of  connective tissue in tendons and the matrix of  bones, as the silk of  spiders\u2019 webs and silkworm cocoons, and as the keratin that makes up hair, nails, horns and feathers.\nCollagen is a fibrous protein that gives strength to tendons, ligaments, bones and skin. It is the most \ncommon structural protein found in animals \u2013 up to 35% of  the protein in your body is collagen. \nCollagen is extremely strong \u2013 the fibres have a tensile strength similar to that of  steel. This is due to the unusual structure of  the collagen molecule. Its quaternary structure has three polypeptide chains, each up to 1000 amino acids long. The primary structure of  these chains is repeating sequences of  glycine with two other amino acids \u2013 often proline and hydroxyproline.

One of  the main ways substances move into \nand out of  cells is by diffusion. Diffusion is the free movement of  particles in a liquid or a gas down a concentration gradient. This movement is from an area where the particles are at a relatively high concentration to an area where they are at a relatively low concentration (see Section 2A.2).\nIn single-celled organisms and microscopic multicellular organisms, diffusion is sufficient to supply all their needs. However, when organisms reach a certain size, diffusion alone is not enough.\nTRANSPORT IN SMALL ORGANISMS\nFor a single-celled organism like an amoeba and for very small multicellular organisms including many marine larvae, the nutrients and oxygen that they need can diffuse directly into the cells from the external environment and waste substances can diffuse directly out. This works well for the following reasons.\n \u2022T\nhe diffusion distances from the outside to the innermost areas of  \nthe cells are very small.\n \u2022T\nhe surface area in contact with the outside environment is very \nlarge when compared to the volume of  the inside of  the organism. Its surface area to volume ratio (sa\n :\n v\nol) is large, so there is \na relatively big surface area over which substances can diffuse into or out of  the organism (see figs A and B).\n \u2022T\nhe metabolic demands are low \u2013 the organisms do not regulate \ntheir own temperature and the cells do not use much oxygen and food or produce much carbon dioxide.\nSingle-celled organisms and very small multicellular organisms do not need specialised transport systems because diffusion is enough to supply their needs.\n\u25b2 fig A  T he surface area : volume ratio of this tiny jellyfish larva is relatively \nlarge so simple diffusion can supply all its needs.MODELLING SURFACE AREA\u00a0:\u00a0VOLUME RATIOS\nThe surface area\u00a0to\u00a0volume ratio of  an organism is the key factor \nthat determines whether diffusion alone will allow substances to move into and out of  all the cells rapidly enough. However, it is not easy to calculate the surface area\u00a0to\u00a0volume ratio of  organisms such as elephants, people and palm trees. It is difficult even for a single-celled Amoeba because of  its irregular shape.\nSo scientists use models to help show what happens in the real \nsituation (see fig B). A simple cube makes surface area\u00a0to\u00a0volume calculations easy. The bigger the organism gets, the smaller the surface area\u00a0to\u00a0volume ratio becomes. The distance from the outside of  the organism to the inside gets longer, and there is proportionately less surface for substances to enter through. So it takes longer for substances to diffuse in, and they may not reach the individual cells quickly enough to supply all their needs.\n1 mm cubeLarger surface area\ncompared to volume.\nSurface area 6 sides 3 12\n5 6  mm2\nVolume 13 5 1  mm3\nSurface areato volume rati\no6 : 16 sides 3 22\n5 24  mm2\n23 5 8  mm3\n3 : 16 sides 3 42\n5 96  mm2\n43 5 64  mm3\n3 : 2\nSurface area\n3.14  \u00b5m2\nVolume4\nr 3 4\n3pr 2p\n0.52  \u00b5m3\nSurface area\nto volume rati o6 : 112.57  \u00b5m2\n4.19  \u00b5m3\n3 : 150.27  \u00b5m2\n33.51  \u00b5m3\n3 : 22 mm cube 4 mm cubeSmaller surface area\ncompared to volume.\n0.5 \u00b5m radius 1 \u00b5m 2 \u00b5m\n\u25b2 fig B  In this diagr am, the cubes and spheres represent models  \nof organisms.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that small organisms have a small surface area.

These cells require a supply of  chemical substances such as glucose and oxygen for cellular respiration. These must be transported from outside a large organism into the cells. Respiration supplies energy for the other reactions of  life, but it also produces the toxic waste product carbon dioxide. This and other waste products need to be removed from the cells before they cause damage to them. \nLarge multicellular organisms have internal transport systems that \ncarry substances to every cell in the body. These systems deliver oxygen and nutrients and remove waste so that cells can carry out their functions efficiently. In large complex animals such as humans, chemicals made in a cell in one part of  the body \u2013 such as a hormone like insulin or adrenaline \u2013 may influence a different type of  cell elsewhere in the body. So substances made internally need to be moved around the body as well.\nIn many animals, including all the vertebrates, this transport \nsystem is the heart and circulatory system and the fluid that flows through it. This is an example of  a mass transport system \u2013 substances are transported in the flow of  a fluid with a mechanism for moving it around the body. All large complex organisms have some form of  mass transport system which overcomes the limits of  diffusion between the internal and external environments. Substances are delivered over short distances from the mass transport system to individual cells deep in the body by processes such as diffusion, osmosis and active transport.\nFEATURES OF MASS TRANSPORT SYSTEMS\nMass transport systems are very effective for moving substances around the body. Most mass transport systems have certain features which are the same. They have:\n \u2022e\nxchange surfaces to get materials into and out of  the transport \nsystem\n \u2022a system of\n vessels that carry substances \u2013 these are usually \ntubes, sometimes following a very specific route, sometimes widespread and branching\n \u2022a w\nay of  making sure that substances are moved in the right \ndirection (e.g. nutrients in and waste out)\n \u2022a w\nay of  moving materials fast enough to supply the needs \nof  the organism \u2013 this may involve mechanical methods such as the pumping of  the heart or ways of  maintaining a concentration gradient so that substances move quickly from one place to another (e.g. using active transport)\n \u2022a suita\nble transport medium (e.g. fluid)\n \u2022in man\ny cases, a way of  adapting the rate of  transport to the \nneeds of  the organism.\nCIRCULATION SYSTEMS\nMany animals have a circulatory system in which a heart pumps blood around the body. Insects have an open circulatory system with the blood circulating in large open spaces. However, most larger animals, including mammals, have a closed circulatory system with the blood contained within tubes. The blood makes a continuous journey out to the most distant parts of  the body and back to the heart.\nLEARNING TIP\nThe main advantages of a closed system are:\n\u2022 the pressure can be increased to make the blood flow more quickly\n\u2022 the flow can be directed more precisely to the organs that need \nmost oxygen and nutrients.\nAnimals such as fish have a single circulation system (see fig \nC). The heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the gills, the organs \nof  gas exchange where the blood takes in oxygen (becomes oxygenated) and gives up carbon dioxide at the same time. The blood then travels on around the rest of  the body of  the fish, giving up oxygen to the body cells before returning to the\u00a0heart.\ngill\ncapillarie saorta\nventricle atriumsystemic\ncapillarie s\n\u25b2 fig C  T he single circulation of a fish  \nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that mass flow is like a stream with all the components \nflowing together.\nBirds and mammals need much more oxygen than fish. Not \nonly do they have to move around without the support of  water, but they also maintain a constant body temperature that may be higher or lower than their surroundings. This takes a lot of  resources, so their cells need plenty of  oxygen and glucose and make waste products that need to be removed quickly. Birds and mammals have evolved the most complex type of  transport system, known as a double circulation because it involves two separate circulation systems. The systemic circulation carries oxygenated blood (oxygen-rich blood) from the heart to the cells of  the body where the oxygen is used. It also carries the deoxygenated blood (blood that has given up its oxygen to the body cells) back to the heart. The pulmonary circulation carries\u00a0deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs to be oxygenated and then carries the oxygenated blood back to the heart (see fig D).\nThe separate circuits of  a double circulatory system ensure that \nthe oxygenated and deoxygenated blood cannot mix, so the tissues receive as much oxygen as possible. Another big advantage is that the fully oxygenated blood can be delivered quickly to the body tissues at high pressure. The blood going through the tiny blood vessels in the lungs is at relatively low pressure, so it does \nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

If  \nthis oxygenated blood at low pressure went straight into the big vessels that carry it around the body, it would move very slowly.

The system delivers the materials needed by the cells of  the body, and carries away the waste products of  their metabolism. Substances move between the plasma or red blood cells and the body cells by diffusion or by active transport (see Section 2A.4). The tiniest blood vessels have walls only one cell thick, so diffusion distances are short and substances pass easily across these into other cells. Every cell in the body is near one of  these small vessels. The blood also carries out other functions, such as carrying hormones (chemical messages) from one part of  the body to another, forming part of  the defence system of  the body and distributing heat.\nTHE COMPONENTS OF THE BLOOD AND THEIR \nMAIN FUNCTIONS\nY ou are going to study all three parts of  the cardiovascular \nsystem, starting with the transport medium \u2013 the blood. Y our blood is a complex mixture carrying a wide variety of  cells and substances to all areas of  your body (see fig A).\nred blood\ncellplateletplasma\nwhitebloodcell\n\u25b2 fig A  T his light micrograph shows red blood cells, white blood cells  \nand platelets.LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n \u25fcUnder stand the role of haemoglobin in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide.\n \u25fcUnder\nstand the oxygen dissociation curve of haemoglobin, the Bohr effect and the significance of the oxygen affinity \nof fetal haemoglobin compared with adult haemoglobin.\n \u25fcUnder\nstand the blood clotting process.\nPLASMA\nY our blood plasma is the fluid part of  your mass transport system. \nOver 50% of  your blood volume is plasma, and it carries all of  your blood cells and everything else that needs transporting around your body. This includes:\n \u2022dig\nested food products (e.g. glucose and amino acids) from the \nsmall intestine to the liver and then to all the parts of  the body where they are needed either for immediate use or storage\n \u2022nutrient molecules fr\nom storage areas to the cells that need \nthem\n \u2022e\nxcretory products (e.g. carbon dioxide and urea) from cells to \nthe organs such as the lungs or kidneys that excrete them from the body\n \u2022chemical messa\nges (hormones) from where they are made to \nwhere they cause changes in the body.\nThe plasma helps to maintain a steady body temperature by transferring heat around the system from internal organs (e.g. the gut) or very active tissues (e.g. leg muscles in someone running) to the skin, where it can be lost to the surroundings. It also acts as a buffer to regulate pH changes.\nERYTHROCYTES (RED BLOOD CELLS)\nThere are approximately 5 million erythrocytes per mm3 of  blood \n(4\u20135 million per mm3 in women, 5\u20136\u00a0million per mm3 in men). \nThey contain haemoglobin, a red pigment that carries oxygen and gives them their colour (see Section 1A.5). They are made in the bone marrow. Mature erythrocytes do not contain a nucleus and have a limited life of  about 120 days.\nThe erythrocytes transport oxygen from the lungs to all the cells. \nThey are well adapted for their function. The biconcave disc shape of  the cells means that they have a large surface area to volume ratio, so oxygen can diffuse into and out of  them rapidly (see fig B). Having no nucleus leaves much more space inside the cells for the haemoglobin molecules that carry the oxygen. In fact, each red blood cell contains around 250\u2013300\u00a0million molecules of  haemoglobin and can carry approximately 1000\u00a0million molecules of  oxygen. Haemoglobin also carries some of  the carbon dioxide produced in respiration back to the lungs. The rest is transported in the plasma.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

There are around 4000\u201311\n \n000\u00a0per\u00a0mm3 of  blood and there are several different types. \nThey are made in the bone marrow, although some mature in the thymus gland. Their main function is to defend the body against infection. Leucocytes are also very important in the inflammatory response of  the body when an area of  tissue is damaged. They all contain a nucleus and have colourless cytoplasm, although some types contain granules which can be stained. There are several different types of  leucocyte, which you will study further in  Book 2 Chapter 6B. \nPLATELETS\nPlatelets are tiny fragments of  large cells called megakaryocytes, which are found in the bone marrow. There are about 150\n 000\u2013400\n 000 pla\ntelets per mm3 of  blood. They are \ninvolved in blood clotting (see page 35).\nTRANSPORT OF OXYGEN\nThe many haemoglobin molecules that are in the red blood cells transport oxygen. Each haemoglobin molecule is a large globular protein consisting of  four peptide chains, each with an iron-containing prosthetic group. Each group can collect four molecules of  oxygen in a reversible process to form oxyhaemoglobin:\n   Hb + 4O2 \u21cb Hb.4O2   ____________________________________     haemoglobin + oxygen \u21cb oxyhaemoglobin     \nT\nhe first oxygen molecule that binds to the haemoglobin changes \nthe arrangement of  the molecule making it easier for the following oxygen molecules to bind. The final oxygen molecule binds several hundred times faster than the first. The same process happens in reverse when oxygen dissociates from haemoglobin \u2013 it gets progressively harder to remove the oxygen.\nEXAM HINT\nAlways use suitable scientific terms. This is important because it can \nhelp to focus a response clearly.\nWhen the blood enters the lungs, the concentration of  oxygen \nin the red blood cells is relatively low. Oxygen moves into the red blood cells from the air in the lungs by diffusion. The oxygen is collected and bound to the haemoglobin, so the free oxygen concentration in the cytoplasm of  the red blood cells stays low. This maintains a steep concentration gradient from the air in the lungs to the red blood cells, so more and more oxygen diffuses in and joins onto the haemoglobin.The oxygen levels are relatively low in the body tissues. The concentration of  oxygen in the cytoplasm of  the red blood cells is higher than in the surrounding tissue. As a result, oxygen moves out into the body cells by diffusion down its concentration gradient. The haemoglobin molecules give up some of  their oxygen. When you are at rest or exercising gently, only about 25% of  the oxygen carried by the haemoglobin is released into your cells. There is another 75% in reserve in the transport system for when you are very active.\nThe strong affinity of  haemoglobin for oxygen means that a \nsmall change in the proportion of  oxygen in the surrounding environment can have a big effect on the saturation of  the blood with oxygen. So in the lungs, the haemoglobin rapidly gains oxygen and in the tissues, as the oxygen saturation of  the environment falls, oxygen is released rapidly (see fig C).\n0100\n50\nPartial pressure of oxygenAs deoxygenated blood approaches the lungs, the steep part of the curv e\nmeans that a small increase in partial pr essure  causes a large increase in\n% saturation.\nAs oxygenated blood approaches the tissues, a small decre ase in\npartial pressure causes a large decrease in % saturation (i.e. a large\nrelease of oxygen).Percentage saturation of \nhaemoglobin with oxygenhigh partial\npressureof oxygen \u2013the conditionsin the lungs\nthe \u2018predicted\u2019 straight linethe actual sigmoid curve\nlow partial pressure ofoxygen \u2013 the conditionsin the respiring tissues\n\u25b2 fig C  Oxy gen dissociation curve for human haemoglobin\nTRANSPORT OF CARBON DIOXIDE\nWaste carbon dioxide diffuses from the respiring cells of  the \nbody tissues into the blood along a concentration gradient. The reaction of  the carbon dioxide with water is crucial. When carbon dioxide is dissolved in the blood it reacts slowly with the water to form carbonic acid, H\n2CO3. The carbonic acid separates to form \nhydrogen ions H+ and hydrogencarbonate ions HCO3\u2013:\nCO2 + H2O \u21cb H2CO3 \u21cb HCO3\u2013 + H+\nAbout 5% of  the carbon dioxide is carried in solution in the plasma. A further 10\u201320% combines with haemoglobin molecules to make carbaminohaemoglobin. Most of  the carbon dioxide is transported in the cytoplasm of  the red blood cells as hydrogencarbonate ions. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase controls the rate of  the reaction between carbon dioxide and water to produce carbonic acid.\nIn the body tissues, there is a high concentration of  carbon dioxide \nin the blood, so carbonic anhydrase catalyses the formation of  carbonic acid.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

It combines with water\nto form carbonic acid, catalysed by the enzymecarbonic anhydrase.\nCarbonic acid dissociates togive hydrogen ions andhydrogencarbonate ions.\nHydrogencarbonate ions pass out of the red blood cells by diffusion, and chloride ions move in. This is called the chloride shift.Haemoglobin acts as a buffer, accepting the hydrogen ions to form haemoglobinic acid to avoid changing the pH of the blood.tissue cells\nplasma\nplasmaCO2 CO2H2O\nH2CO3\nHCO3\u2013HHb\nHbH+\nerythrocyteCl\u2013+\n\u25b2 fig D  T he transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs depends on the reaction of carbon dioxide with \nwater, controlled by an enzyme in the red blood cells.\nTHE BOHR EFFECT\nThe way in which haemoglobin collects and releases oxygen is also affected by the proportion of  \ncarbon dioxide in the tissues (see fig E). When the proportion of  carbon dioxide in the tissues is high, the affinity of  haemoglobin for oxygen is reduced. In other words, haemoglobin needs higher levels of  oxygen to become saturated and releases oxygen much more easily. So in active tissues with high carbon dioxide levels, haemoglobin releases oxygen more readily. Carbon dioxide levels in the lung capillaries are relatively low, which makes it easier for oxygen to bind to the haemoglobin. The changes in the oxygen dissociation curve that result as the carbon dioxide level changes are known as the Bohr effect. \nSaturation with oxygen\/%\n0\n0 2 4 6\nPartial pressure of oxygen\/kPaA 5 2.7  kPa  CO2\nB 5 6.7  kPa  CO2\nC 5 10.6  kPa  CO2\n8 10 12102030405060708090100\nA\nB\nC\n\u25b2 fig E  As the pr oportion of carbon dioxide in the environment rises, the haemoglobin curve moves down and to \nthe right, so it gives up oxygen more easily. This is known as the Bohr effect.\nFETAL HAEMOGLOBIN\nA fetus in the uterus depends on its mother to supply it with oxygen. Oxygenated blood from the mother flows through the placenta close to the deoxygenated fetal blood. If  the blood of  the fetus had the same affinity for oxygen as the blood of  the mother, very little oxygen would be transferred. Fortunately, the blood of  the fetus contains a special form of  the oxygen-carrying pigment called fetal haemoglobin. Fetal haemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than the adult haemoglobin of  the mother. Consequently, the fetal haemoglobin can remove oxygen from the maternal blood even when the proportion of  oxygen is relatively low (see fig F). The maternal and fetal blood also run in LEARNING TIP\nRemember that as CO2 builds \nup it affects the pH and this has \nan effect on the protein structure, so haemoglobin does not work as well (i.e. it has a lower affinity for oxygen).\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

While underwater, the seals \ncannot breathe but they have three adaptations of the blood that allow them to stay underwater for a long time.\u2022\n They have up t\no twice the blood volume of a land mammal of the same size, with extra spaces in \ntheir circulatory system to store oxygenated blood.\n\u2022\n They have mor\ne erythrocytes per unit of blood than land mammals, and scientists think the \nerythrocytes also contain more haemoglobin. As a result, they have up to three times as much haemoglobin as a land mammal of a similar size.\n\u2022\n They have over 10 times mor\ne myoglobin in their muscles than humans. Myoglobin is another \npigment with an affinity for oxygen which is higher than either haemoglobin or fetal haemoglobin. In elephant seals, the myoglobin is so dense their muscles look almost black.\nThese adaptations mean that elephant seals have an enormous oxygen store in their bodies when they dive, which helps to explain why they are such masters of the underwater world. \n\u25b2 fig G  Elephant seal underw aterEXAM HINT\nBe precise with your descriptions \ne.g. fetal haemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than maternal haemoglobin \u2013 it is not the fetus or the blood that has a higher affinity.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Much of this book is concerned with \nhow these decisions are made, the information needed to \nmake them and the techniques that can assist managers in \nthis important task. However, no student of Business can \nhope to make much progress in the study of this subject \nunless they have a good understanding of the economic \nenvironment in which a business operates. Business activity \ndoes not take place in isolation from what is going on \naround it. Th e very structure and health of the economy \nwill have a great impact on how successful business activity \nis. Th e central purpose of this whole unit, \u2018Business and \nits environment\u2019, is to introduce the inter-relationships \nbetween businesses, the world in which they operate and the \nlimits that governments impose on business activity. Th i s  \nfi rst chapter explains the nature of business activity and the \nrole of enterprise in setting up and developing businesses.\nThe purpose of business activity\nA business is any organisation that uses resources to \nmeet the needs of customers by providing a product or \nservice that they demand. Th ere are several stages in the \nproduction of fi nished goods. Business activity at all stages \ninvolves creating and adding value to resources, such \nas raw materials and semi- fi nished goods, and making \nthem more desirable to \u00a0\u2013 and thus valued by \u00a0\u2013 the fi nal \npurchaser. Without business activity, we would all still be \nentirely dependent on the goods that we could make or \ngrow ourselves \u00a0\u2013 as some people in virtually undiscovered \nnative communities still are. Business activity uses the \nscarce resources of our planet to produce goods and \nservices that allow us all to enjoy a very much higher \nstandard of living than would be possible if we remained \nentirely self-su ffi  cient.On completing this chapter, you will be able to:\n\u25a0 understand what business activity involves\n\u25a0 recognise that making choices as a result of the \n\u2018economic problem\u2019 always results in opportunity cost\n\u25a0 analyse the meaning and importance of creating value\n\u25a0 recognise the key characteristics of successful \nentrepreneurs\u25a0 assess the importance of enterprise and entrepreneurs \nto a country\u2019s economy\n\u25a0 understand the meaning of social enterprise and the \ndiff erence between this and other businesses.\n3What do businesses do?\nBusinesses identify the needs of consumers or other fi rms. \nTh e y  t h e n  p u r c h a s e  r e s o u r c e s \u00a0\u2013 or factors of production \u00a0\u2013 in \norder to produce goods and services that satisfy these needs, \nusually with the aim of making a pro fi t. Before we go on, it \nwill be useful to explain some important business terms that \nhave either already been used, or will be referred to soon, in \nthis chapter. Business activity exists to produce consumer \ngoods  or services  that meet the needs of customers. Th e s e  \ngoods and services can be classi fi ed in several ways.\nConsumer goods: the physical and tangible goods sold to \nthe general public \u00a0\u2013 they include durable consumer goods, \nsuch as cars and washing machines, and non-durable \nconsumer goods, such as food, drinks and sweets that can \nbe used only once.\nConsumer services: the non-tangible products sold to \nthe general public \u00a0\u2013 they include hotel accommodation, \ninsurance services and train journeys.\nKEY TERMS\nWhat do businesses need to produce goods \nand services?\nFactors of production\nTh ese are the resources needed by business to produce \ngoods or services. Th e y  i n c l u d e :\n\u25a0 Land \u00a0\u2013 this general term includes not only land itself but all \nof the renewable and non-renewable resources of nature, \nsuch as coal, crude oil and timber.\n\u25a0 Labour \u00a0\u2013 manual and skilled labour make up the workforce \nof the business.\n\u25a0 Capital \u00a0\u2013 this is not just the finance needed to set up a \nbusiness and pay for its continuing operations, but also \nall of the man-made resources used in production. These \ninclude capital goods , such as computers, machines, \nfactories, o ff i c es  a nd  v eh i c l es.\n\u25a0 Enterprise \u00a0\u2013 this is the driving force, provided by risk-\ntaking individuals, that combines the other factors of \nproduction into a unit capable of producing goods and \nservices. It provides a managing, decision-making and \ncoordinating \u00a0role.\nCapital goods: the physical goods used by industry to \naid in the production of other goods and services, such as \nmachines and commercial vehicles.\nKEY TERM\nBusinesses have many other needs before they can \nsuccessfully produce the goods and services demanded by \ncustomers. Figure 1.1 shows the wide range of these needs.The concept of creating or adding value\nAll businesses aim to create value by selling goods and \nservices for a higher price than the cost of bought-in \nmaterials, this is called \u2018 creating value \u2019. If a customer \nis prepared to pay a price that is greater than the cost \nof materials used in making or providing a good or \nservice, then the business has been successful in creating \nvalue.

Very \npoor people are unable to obtain the basic requirements \nof life \u00a0\u2013 food, clean water, shelter \u00a0\u2013 and they have many \nunsatis fi ed needs and wants. Even very rich people may \nnot be able to satisfy all of their wants for luxury goods \nand services. It should be clear to us all that there are \ninsu ffi  cient goods to satisfy all of our needs and wants at \nany one time; this is known as \u2018the economic problem\u2019. It \nis the purpose of economic activity to provide for as many \nof our wants as possible, yet we are still le ft  wanting more. \nTh is shortage of products \u00a0\u2013 together with the resources \nneeded to make them \u00a0\u2013 lead to us all having to make \nchoices. As we cannot satisfy all of our wants, then we \nmust choose those which we will satisfy now and those \nwhich we will forgo. If we are careful and rational, we \nwill choose those things that give us the greatest bene fi t, leaving out those things of less value to us. Th i s  n e e d  \nto choose is not exclusive to people as consumers.

This requires original ideas and an ability to do things \ndiff erently \u00a0\u2013 this is the skill of innovation.\nCommitment and self-motivation:  It is never an easy option to \nset up and run your own business. It is hard work and may take \nup many hours of each day. A willingness to work hard, keen \nambition to succeed, energy and focus are all essential qualities \nof a successful entrepreneur.\nMultiskilled:  An entrepreneur will have to make the product \n(or provide the service), promote it, sell it and keep accounts. \nThese di ff erent business tasks require a person who has many \ndiff erent qualities, such as being keen to learn technical skills, \nbeing able to get on with people and being good at handling \nmoney and keeping accounting records.\nLeadership skills:  The entrepreneur will have to lead by \nexample and must have a personality that encourages \npeople \u00a0in the business to follow them and be motivated \nby\u00a0them.\nSelf-confidence and an ability to bounce back:  Many \nbusiness start-ups fail, yet this would not discourage a true \nentrepreneur who would have such belief in themselves and their business idea that they would bounce back from \u00a0any \nsetbacks.\nRisk taking:  Entrepreneurs must be willing to take risks in \norder to see results.

If these are of poor quality or \nfrequently late, then the same problems will apply when \ntrying to satisfy your own customers. So good, reliable \nsuppliers must be found and given clear guidance on what \nis required. In return, the purchasing business should \npay promptly, place regular orders and o ff er long-term \ncontracts.\nBene fi ts of accepting these responsibilities: supplier \nloyalty \u00a0\u2013 prepared to meet deadlines and requests for \nspecial orders; reasonable credit terms more likely to \nbe\u00a0off ered.\n3 Responsibilities to employees\nAll countries have some laws that outline business \nresponsibilities to workers \u00a0\u2013 these laws are stricter in \nsome countries than others. Apart from not breaking \nthese laws, do businesses have other responsibilities \nto employees? Many people think they do. Providing \ntraining opportunities, job security, paying more than \nminimum wages when these are very low, o ff ering good \nworking conditions, involving sta ff  in some decision-\nmaking \u00a0\u2013 these are some examples of business decisions \nthat, it is o ft en claimed, should be in fl uenced by business \nresponsibilities to workers.Bene fi ts of accepting these responsibilities: employee \nloyalty and low labour turnover; easier to recruit good \nstaff ; employee suggestions for improving e ffi  ciency and \ncustomer service; improved motivation and more e ff ective \ncommunication.\n4 Responsibilities to local community\nBusinesses that fail to meet responsibilities to the \nlocal \u00a0community may experience serious problems \nwith \u00a0opposition to plans to expand or they may not \nattract local customers. It is argued that businesses \nshould meet the following responsibilities to the local \npopulation: o ff er secure employment so that there is \nless\u00a0local fear of job losses, spend as much as possible \non local supplies to generate more income, reduce the \ntransport impact of business activity as much as possible \nand also keep the adverse environmental e ff ects to a \nminimum.\nBene fi ts of accepting these responsibilities:  local \ncouncils will be more likely to give planning permission \nto expand the business; local communities are more \nlikely to accept some of the negative e ff ects caused by \nbusiness operations if they provide fi nancial support \nfor community groups and projects such as children\u2019s \nplaygrounds; local councils o ft en only give contracts to \nbusinesses with a record of community involvement.Business decision\/\nactivityPossible impact on \nemployeesPossible impact on local \ncommunity Possible impact on

responsibilities54Cambridge International AS and A Level Business","85":"3 Consumer surveys\nTh ese involve directly asking consumers or potential \nconsumers for their opinions and preferences. Th ey can be \nused to obtain both qualitative and quantitative research. \nFor example, here are two questions asked in a recent \nsurvey of shoppers:\n1 How many foreign holidays did you take last year?\n2 What do you look for in an ideal foreign holiday?\nTh e fi rst question is designed to obtain quantitative \ndata, which can be presented graphically and analysed \nstatistically. Th e second question is designed to fi nd \nout the key qualitative features of a holiday that would \ninfl uence consumer choice. Th ere are four important \nissues for market researchers to be aware of when \nconducting consumer surveys:\n1 Who to ask?  Given that in most cases it is impossible or \ntoo expensive to survey all potential members of a target \nmarket (called the survey population), it is necessary to \nselect a \u2018 sample \u2019 from this population. The more closely \nthis sample reflects the characteristics of the survey \npopulation, then the more accurate the survey is likely \nto\u00a0be.\n2 What to ask?  The construction of an unbiased and \nunambiguous questionnaire is essential if the survey is to \nobtain useful results.\n3 How to ask?  Should the questionnaire be self-completed \nand returned by post or filled in by an interviewer in a face-\nto-face session with the respondent? Could a telephone \nsurvey be conducted instead?\n4 How accurate is it?  Assessing the likely accuracy and \nvalidity of the results is a crucial element of market research \nsurveys.\nSample:  the group of people taking part in a market \nresearch survey selected to be representative of the overall \ntarget market.\nKEY TERM\nSample size\nIn nearly all market research situations it is impossible \nto seek evidence from the total \u2018population\u2019, i.e. the \ntotal potential market that the fi rm is aiming at. Th i s  i s  \neither because that market is so extensive that contacting \neveryone in it would be too expensive or time-consuming \nor it is impossible to identify everyone in that market.\nSo a sample of the total potential market will need to \nbe chosen. Generally speaking, the larger the sample, the \nmore representative of the total population it is likely to be \nand greater con fi dence can be placed in the fi nal results. In surveying consumer reaction to a new advertising \ncampaign for a major brand of chocolate, a sample of ten \npeople is unlikely to be su ffi  cient. Try to work out why. \nTh e fi rst ten people chosen might show a positive reaction \nto the new advertisement. Yet another ten might show a \nmajority with negative reactions. A sample of ten is too \nsmall to be con fi dent about the result, as chance variations \ncould easily occur because of the limited number of \nrespondents chosen. A sample of 100 or even 1,000 will \nproduce results that will re fl ect much more accurately \nthe total preferences of the whole survey population. \nTh ere will be much less risk of pure chance distorting the \nresults. Obviously, a sample of 1,000 is more useful than \none of 100, especially if the questions are being focused on \nparticular age or income groups. Once a sample of 100 is \nbroken down into, say, ten di ff erent age groups, then there \nwill only be ten respondents from each age band. Th i s  \ncould be too few.\nWhat prevents all primary research being based on \na sample size of 1,000? Cost and time are the two major \nconstraints here \u2013 the cost of research increases greatly \nwith the sample size, especially when a specialist fi rm of \nmarket research analysts is used. Th e results of a survey \nmight be needed quickly to assist managers in making \nrapid decisions \u2013 a sample size of 1,000 will take much \nlonger to organise.\nSampling methods\nProbability sampling\nTh is involves the selection of a sample from a population \nbased on the principle of random chance. It is more \ncomplex, more time-consuming and usually more costly \nthan non-probability sampling. However, because the \nsample is selected randomly and the probability of each \nunit\u2019s inclusion in the sample can be calculated, very \nreliable estimates can be made about both the whole \ntarget market (the \u2018statistical population\u2019) and about the \nchances of errors occurring. Th ese are the most common \nprobability sampling methods:\n\u25a0 Simple random sampling:  Each member of the target \npopulation has an equal chance of being included in the \nsample. To select a random sample the following are \nneeded:\n\u25a0 a list of all of the people in the target population\n\u25a0 sequential numbers given to each member of this \npopulation\n\u25a0 a list of random numbers generated by computer.\n If a sample of 100 is required, then the first 100 numbers on \nthe random number list are taken and the people who had \nthese numbers allocated to them will form the sample.238Cambridge International AS and A Level Business\u25a0 Systematic sampling:  In this method, the sample \nis selected by taking every nth item from the target \npopulation until the desired size of sample is reached. For \nexample, suppose a supermarket wants to study the buying \nhabits of its customers. The sample could be chosen by \nasking every tenth customer entering the supermarket until \nthe required sample size had been reached. The researcher \nmust ensure that the chosen sample does not hide a regular \npattern, and a random starting point must be selected.\n\u25a0 Stratified sampling: This method recognises that the \ntarget population may be made up of many di ff erent groups \nwith many di ff erent opinions. These groups are called strata \nor layers of the population and for a sample to be accurate \nit should contain members of all of these strata \u2013 hence the \nterm, stratified sampling. For example, if you were asked to \nsample 100 fellow students in your school about so ft  drink \npreferences for the school shop, it would be more accurate \nif, instead of asking 100 friends, you split the school up into \ncertain strata, such as class groups, ages or gender. So if the \nwhole school contains 1,000 students of whom 50 are girls \nin Year 8, an accurate sample of 100 would contain five girls \nfrom Year 8 (50\/1,000 \u00d7 100). This process would be repeated \nwith all year groups until the total required sample of 100 \nwas reached. The people to be surveyed in each stratum \nshould be selected randomly. Stratified sampling may also \nbe used when a product is designed to appeal to just one \nsegment of the market. So if a computer game is aimed \nat 16 \u221224-year-olds, only people from this stratum of the \npopulation will be included in the market research sample.\n\u25a0 Quota sampling:  This is similar to stratified sampling. By \nthis method, interviewees are selected according to the \ndiff erent proportions that certain consumer groups mak e \nup of the whole target population. For instance, if it is \nalready known that out of all consumers of denim jeans:\n\u25a0 65% are male\n\u25a0 35% are female\n\u25a0 35% are aged 14\u201320\n\u25a0 35% are aged 21\u201330\n\u25a0 20% are aged 31\u201340\n\u25a0 41 10% are aged over 41\n then the sample selected would conform to the same \nproportions. Therefore, if there were a sample of 200 \npeople, 130 would be male, 70 female, 70 between 14 and \n20 years old and so on. The interviewer could then choose \nthe quotas by questioning the right number of people in \nthe high street. However, the interviewer might be biased \nin their selection of people in each quota \u2013 preferring to ask \nonly very attractive people, for example. This makes quota \nsampling less probability-based than the other methods \nand more open to individual bias.\n\u25a0 Cluster sampling:  When a full sampling frame list is not \navailable or the target population is too geographically \ndispersed, then cluster sampling will take a sample from \njust one or a few groups \u2013 not the whole population. This \nmight be just one town or region and this will help to reduce costs \u2013 but it may not be fully representative of the whole \npopulation. Random methods can then be used to select \nthe sample from this group. A multinational company \nwanting to research global attitudes towards its product \nwould save time and money by concentrating on just a few \nareas for its research.\nTOP TIP\nEach method of sampling has its own advantages and \nlimitations \u2013 so which is best? This depends on the size \nand financial resources of the business and how di ff erent \nconsumers are in their tastes between di ff erent age \ngroups and so on. Cost-e ff ectiveness is important in all \nmarket research decisions.\nRandom sampling:  every member of the target \npopulation has an equal chance of being selected.\nSystematic sampling:  every nth item in the target \npopulation is selected.\nStratified sampling:  this draws a sample from a specified \nsub-group or segment of the population and uses random \nsampling to select an appropriate number from each \nstratum.\nQuota sampling:  when the population has been stratified \nand the interviewer selects an appropriate number of \nrespondents from each stratum.\nCluster sampling:  using one or a number of specific \ngroups to draw samples from and not selecting from the \nwhole population, e.g. using one town or region.\nKEY TERMS\nNon-probability sampling\nTh is approach to sampling cannot be used to calculate \nthe probability of any particular sample being selected. \nNon-probability sample results cannot be used to make \ninferences or judgements about the total population. Any \ngeneral statements that are made as a result of this method \nof sampling must be analysed very carefully and fi ltered by \nthe researcher knowledge of the topic being researched.\nTh ese are the most common methods of non-\nprobability sampling:\n\u25a0 Convenience sampling:  Members of the population are \nchosen based on their relative ease of access. Sampling \nfriends, fellow workers or shoppers in just one location are \nall examples of convenience sampling.\n\u25a0 Snowball sampling:  The first respondent refers a friend \nwho then refers another friend\u2026 and so the process \ncontinues. This is a cheap method of sampling and is o ft en 23917: Market research used by companies in the financial services sector, such as \nhealth- and motor-insurance companies. It is likely to lead \nto a biased sample, as each respondent\u2019s friends are likely \nto have a similar lifestyle and opinions.\n\u25a0 Judgemental sampling: The researcher chooses the \nsample based on who they think would be appropriate to \nstudy. This could be used by an experienced researcher who \nmay be short of time as they have been asked to produce a \nreport quickly.\n\u25a0 Ad hoc quotas:  A quota is established (say 55% women) \nand researchers are told to choose any respondent they \nwish up to the pre-set quota.\nAll of these samples are likely to lead to less accurate \nresults \u2013 which are less representative of the whole \npopulation \u2013 than probability sampling techniques.\nTOP TIP\nStudents studying the Cambridge syllabus will only \nbe asked questions about random, stratified and \nquota sampling \u2013 the other methods are included for \ncomparison purposes and to show the range of possible \nalternatives.\nWhat to ask \u2013 questionnaire design\nIt is not easy to write an e ff ective questionnaire. Th e \ntemptation is o ft en to ask too many questions in the hope \nof gaining every last scrap of information. Yet people \nmay become suspicious or bored with so many questions. \nUnless it is absolutely essential to know the names and \nprecise ages or income levels of respondents, these \nquestions are best avoided, as there will be reluctance to \nanswer them. One way around this is to group income \nlevels together, such as:\nPlease indicate which of the following income levels \nyou are in:\n$10,000\u2013$20,000\n$20,001\u2013$30,000\nand so on.\nOpen questions:  those that invite a wide-ranging or \nimaginative response \u2013 the results will be di ff icult to collate \nand present numerically.\nClosed questions:  questions to which a limited number of \npre-set answers is o ff ered.\nKEY TERMS\nAsking all \u2018 open \u2019 questions  is not a good idea, although \nquestionnaires usually end with one. Th e y  a l l o w  respondents to give their opinion. For example: \u2018What \ndo you really think of Jupiter perfume?\u2019 \u2212 the answers \nto this will be so varied in length and content that \nthe results will be very di ffi  cult to put together and to \npresent statistically. A better option might be: \u2018What \nmost attracted you to buying Jupiter perfume?\u2019 followed \nby a list of options for the respondents to tick or rate, \nsuch as:\n\u25a0 price\n\u25a0 image\n\u25a0 packaging\n\u25a0 widely available\n\u25a0 smell.\nAs the design of the questionnaire will greatly in fl uence \nthe accuracy and usefulness of the results, it is advisable to \nundertake an initial pilot survey to test the quality of the \nquestions. Other principles to follow include:\n\u25a0 making the objectives of the research clear so that \nquestions can be focused on these\n\u25a0 writing clear and unambiguous questions\n\u25a0 trying to make sure that the questions follow each other in \na\u00a0logical sequence\n\u25a0 avoiding questions that seem to point to one particular \nanswer\n\u25a0 using language that will be readily understood\n\u25a0 including some questions that will allow a classification of \nresults by gender, area lived in, occupation and so on.\nHow to ask? Self-completed questionnaire \nor direct interview?\nSelf-completed questionnaires are either sent through \nthe post or fi lled in by the respondent themselves \u2018on the \nspot\u2019, for example in a shop. Postal surveys are relatively \ncheap to send out, a wide geographical area can be \ncovered and there is no chance of bias creeping in from \nthe interviewer to distort results. However, the response \nrate to both these and other forms of self-completed \nquestionnaires is nearly always very poor, questions could \neasily be misunderstood and the sample returned could \nbe biased in favour of those respondents with the most \nspare time, for example retired people. Direct interviews \nare conducted by an interviewer, usually either in the \nstreet or in the respondent\u2019s home. Skilled interviewers \nwill avoid bias in the way in which they ask questions, and \ndetailed questions can be explained to the interviewee. \nFollow-up questions can be asked if required. Th i s  c a n  \nbe an expensive method, but the interviewer will \ncontinue their work until the pre-set sample size \nhas been reached \u2013 whereas the response to postal \nquestionnaires is always uncertain.240Cambridge International AS and A Level Business","86":"Introduction\nTh e marketing mix  is a range of tactical marketing \ndecisions for a product. Deciding on the appropriate \nmarketing mix is a major factor in in fl uencing whether a \nbusiness can sell its products pro fi tably \u2013 the aim of most \nmarketing departments.\nMarketing mix\nTh e marketing mix is made up of four inter-related \ndecisions \u2212 the 4Ps. Th ese are product design and \nperformance, price, promotion including advertising \nand place, where and how a product will be sold to \nconsumers:\n\u25a0 Consumers require the right product . This might be an \nexisting product, an adaptation of an existing product or a \nnewly developed one.\n\u25a0 The right price  is important too. If set too low, then \nconsumers might lose confidence in the product\u2019s quality; \nif too high, then many will be unable or unwilling to \naff ord it.\n\u25a0 Promotion  must be e ff ective \u2013 telling consumers about the \nproduct\u2019s availability and convincing them, if possible, that \nyour brand is the one to choose.\n\u25a0 Place  refers to how the product is distributed to the \nconsumer. If it is not available at the right time in the right \nplace, then even the best product in the world will not be \nbought in the quantities expected.\nMarketing mix:  the four key decisions that must be taken \nin the e ff ective marketing of a product.\nKEY TERM\nNot all of these 4Ps have the same degree of signi fi cance \nin every case. It is vital that these elements fi t together \ninto a coherent and integrated plan. Th e  r e m a i n d e r  \nof this chapter and the next one will analyse in detail \nthe individual signi fi cance of these four marketing \nelements and consider the options available to marketing \nmanagers.\nIn some texts, the number of Ps is increased to fi ve, \nsix or even seven. For example, it is argued that in the \nmarketing of services rather than tangible goods, people \n(skilled and motivated sta ff ) and process (the way in which \nthe customer accesses the service) are as important as the \noriginal 4Ps.\nTh e key issue that must always be remembered about \nthe marketing mix \u2013 no matter how many Ps you care to \ngive it \u2013 is that these marketing decisions are inter-related \nand, because of this, they must be carefully coordinated to \nmake sure that customers are not confused by con fl icting messages being given about the good or service being sold. \nTh is point is returned to in the next chapter.\nThe role of the customer \u2013 the 4Cs\nSome business analysts consider that the 4Ps approach \nis rather old-fashioned and too much centred on the \nfi rm and its product rather than the ultimate user \u2013 the \nconsumer. Th e \u20184Cs\u2019 has been proposed as an alternative \nview of the key elements of successful marketing. Th ese \ncan be summarised as:\n\u25a0 Customer solution  \u2013 what the firm needs to provide to meet \nthe customer\u2019s needs and wants.\n\u25a0 Cost to customer  \u2013 the total cost of the product including \nextended guarantees, delivery charges and financing costs.\n\u25a0 Communication with customer  \u2013 providing up-to-date \nand easily accessible two-way communication links with \ncustomers to both promote the product and gain back \nimportant consumer market research information.\n\u25a0 Convenience to customer  \u2013 providing easily accessible \npre-sales information and demonstrations and convenient \nlocations for buying the product.\nTh ese can be linked to the 4Ps, as shown in Table 18.1\nUnfortunately, the 4Cs are not as easy to remember \nas the 4Ps and they do not so clearly relate to speci fi c \nmarketing decisions, so most textbooks still tend to use \nthe 4Ps. Th e 4Cs are important, however, in putting the \ncustomer fi rst in marketing decisions and this is the key \nfeature of customer relationship management .\nCustomer relationship management (CRM):  using \nmarketing activities to establish successful customer \nrelationships so that existing customer loyalty can be \nmaintained.\nKEY TERM\nTh e key aim of CRM is not necessarily to win new \ncustomers but to keep  existing ones. Studies have shown \nthat it can cost between four and ten times as much to \ngain new customers (with expensive promotions) as \nit does to keep existing ones.

Products \ncannot just be \u2018launched and forgotten\u2019 but must \nbe developed, marketed and managed to help the \nbusiness increase sales profitably. The product is often \nconsidered to be the most important element of the \nmarketing mix, if it fails to work, is poorly designed \nand looks ugly, will low prices and extensive advertising \nhelp sales much?\nHowever, product is just one part of the overall \nstrategy needed to win and keep customers. Price, \npromotion and place are also key factors in making \nproducts successful \u2013 and a balanced and integrated \nmarketing mix is essential. But without a well managed \nproduct portfolio that o ff ers customer real and \ndistinctive bene fi ts, marketing objectives are unlikely \never to be achieved. \nWhy is price a key part of the \nmarketing mix?\nPrice is the amount paid by customers for a product. \nDetermining an appropriate price for a good or service is \na vital component of the marketing mix. Price can have a \ngreat impact on the consumer demand for the product \u2013 \nsee Chapter 16 for a discussion o f a typical demand curve.\nTh e pricing l evel set for a product will also:\n\u25a0 determine the degree of value added by the business to \nbought-in components\n\u25a0 influence the revenue and profit made by a business due to \nthe impact on demand\n\u25a0 reflect on the marketing objectives of the business and \nhelp establish the psychological image and identity of \na\u00a0product.\nGet the pricing decision wrong and much hard work in \nmarket research and product development can be put at \nrisk. For all these reasons, pricing decisions are some of \nthe most signi fi cant issues that marketing managers are \nfaced with.\nPrice elasticity of demand\nLook at the two demand curves in Figures 18.7 and 18.8, \nD2 D2 has a steeper gradient than D1 D1. What impact does \nthe slope or gradient of the curves have on the demand \nlevels for these two products when prices are changed? \nYou  w i l l  n ot i c e  t h at ,  w h e n  t h e  pr i c e  of  b ot h  pro du c t s  i s  \nincreased by the same amount, the reduction in demand \nis greater for product B than it is for product A. Th i s  c o u l d  \nbe very important information for the marketing manager because the total revenue for product A has actually \nincreased, but for B it has fallen, as can be seen by the size \nof the shaded areas.\nTh is relationship between price changes and the size \nof the resulting change in demand is known as price \nelasticity of demand .\nPrice elasticity of demand:  measures the responsiveness \nof demand following a change in price.\nKEY TERM\nTh is concept can be demonstrated on demand curves \nas shown above \u2013 product A\u2019s demand is less elastic or \nresponsive to a price change than product B\u2019s. Th i s  i d e a  \ncan also be measured mathematically.\nTh e formula for price elasticity of demand (PED) is:percentage change in quantity demandedpercentage change inpriceQuantity demanded\/week0 Price\n$5\n$4\n270  300Rise in Revenue\nFall in\nRevenueD2\nD2\nFigure 18.7 Demand curve for product A\nFigure 18.8  Demand curve for product BQuantity demanded\/week0 Price\nD1\nD1$5\n$4\n200               300     Rise\nFall260Cambridge International AS and A Level BusinessTh e value of PED is normally negative because a fall in \nprice (\u2013ve) usually results in a rise in demand (+ve). Th i s  i s  \ncalled an inverse relationship. It is quite common to ignore \nthe negative sign of the PED result, as it is the extent of the \nchange that is important.\nExample: In Figure 18.7, the price increased from $4 to \n$5 and demand fell from 300 units per week to 270 units. \nWhat is the PED?\nStep 1: Calculate the percentage change in price.\nStep 2:  Calculate the percentage change in demand.\nStep 3:  U s e  t h e  P E D  f o r m u l a :\n  %  c h a n g e  i n  d e m a n d  =  1 0\n  %  c h a n g e  i n  p r i c e  =  2 5PED=102504=It is now important to explain this result. A PED of 0.4 \n(do not forget that we are overlooking the minus sign) \nmeans that demand changes by 0.4% for every 1.0% \nchange in price. As this is less than one, it is described as \nbeing inelastic. Consumers do not respond greatly to a \nchange in the price in this product: an increase in price \nwill raise a fi rm \u2019 s revenue, while a price reduction, because \ndemand will change little, will reduce revenue.ACTIVITY  18.4\n[6 marks, 8 minutes]\n1 Using the information in Figure 18.8  calculate \nthe PED following the rise in p rice of product B. [2]\n2 Comment on your result \u2013 explain what it \nmeans. [4]\nTable 18.3 shows how di ff erent possible results for PED \nmay be classi fi ed.\nFactors that determine price elasticity\nTh ere are a number of factors that will determine the \nPED of a product:\n1 How necessary the product is:  The more necessary \nconsumers consider a product to be, the less they will \nreact to price changes. This will tend to make the demand \ninelastic, for example salt and oil.\n2 How many similar competing products or brands there \nare:  If there are many competitors, then there are a large \nnumber of substitutes, and consumers will quickly switch \nto another brand if the price of one manufacturer\u2019s product \nincreases \u2212 for example fruit being sold by one seller in \na large street market. Any move by a business to reduce Value of PED (ignoring minus sign) Classification Explanation\nZero Perfectly inelastic \ndemand\u25a0 The same amount is demanded, no matter what the price. In \nreality, there is no product that would have this PED.\nBetween 0 and 1 Inelastic demand \u25a0 The percentage change in demand is less than the \npercentage change in price. If a firm faces this elasticity \nof demand, it can raise the price, not lose much demand \nand increase sales revenue. However, this cannot keep \nhappening. As the price continues to rise, demand will \nbecome more elastic.\nUnitary Unit elasticity \u25a0 The percentage change in demand is equal and opposite to \nthe percentage change in price, so any price change will lead \nto an equal change in demand and the total sales revenue \nwill remain constant. When PED = 1, sales revenue will be \nmaximised.\nBetween 1 and infinity ( \u221e) Elastic demand \u25a0 The percentage change in demand is greater than the \npercentage change in price. If a firm faces this elasticity \nof demand, then it can lower the price, pick up a lot more \ndemand and increase sales revenue.\nInfinity ( \u221e) Perfectly elastic \ndemand\u25a0 An infinitely large amount is demanded at one price and \nthen demand falls to zero if the price is raised, even by the \nsmallest amount. In reality, there is no product that would \nhave this PED.\nTable 18.3 The potential range of elasticity and its e ff ects (negative signs are not shown) \u00a026118: The marketing mix \u2212 product and price ","88":"Methods Advantages Disadvantages\nFull-cost pricing \u25a0 price set will cover all costs of production\n\u25a0 easy to calculate for single-product firms where \nthere is no doubt about fixed cost allocation\n\u25a0 suitable for firms that are \u2018price-makers\u2019 due to \nmarket dominance\u25a0 inaccurate for businesses with several products \nwhere there is doubt over the allocation of fixed \ncosts\n\u25a0 does not take market\/competitive conditions \ninto account\n\u25a0 tends to be inflexible, e.g. there might be \nopportunities to increase price even higher\n\u25a0 if sales fall, average costs o ft en rise \u2013 this could \nlead to the price being raised using this method\nContribution \npricing\u25a0 all variable costs will be covered by the price \u2013 \nand a contribution made to fixed costs\n\u25a0 suitable for firms producing several products \u2013 \nfixed costs do not have to be allocated\n\u25a0 flexible \u2013 price can be adapted to suit market \nconditions or to accept special orders\u25a0 fixed costs may not be covered\n\u25a0 if prices vary too much \u2013 due to the flexibility \nadvantage \u2013 then regular customers might be \nannoyed\nCompetitor pricing \u25a0 almost essential for firms with little market \npower \u2013 price-takers\n\u25a0 flexible to market and competitive conditions\u25a0 price set may not cover all of the costs of \nproduction\n\u25a0 may have to vary price frequently due to \nchanging market and competitive conditions\nPrice \ndiscrimination\u25a0 uses price elasticity knowledge to charge \ndiff erent prices in order to increase total \nrevenue\u25a0 administrative costs of having di ff erent pricing \nlevels\n\u25a0 customers may switch to lower-priced market\n\u25a0 consumers paying higher prices may object and \nlook for alternatives\nTable 18.4 Summary of pricing methodsPricing methods\nTh ere are several di ff erent pricing methods that can be \nused and these are broadly categorised into cost-based \nmethods and market\/competition-based methods (see \nTable 18.4).\nCost-based pricing\nTh e basic idea is that fi rms will assess their costs of \nproducing or supplying each unit, and then add an \namount on top of the calculated cost. Th ere are a number \nof di ff erent methods of cost-based pricing that may be \nadopted:\nMark-up pricing\nTh is method is o ft en used by retailers, who take the price \nthat they pay the producer or wholesaler for the product \nin question, and then just add a percentage mark-up. Th e \nsize of the mark-up usually depends upon a combination \nof the strength of demand for the product, the number of \nother suppliers and the age and stage of life of the product. \nSometimes it also depends on traditional practice in the \nindustry.Mark-up pricing:  adding a fixed mark-up for profit to the \nunit price of a product.\nKEY TERM\nExample 1:\nTotal cost of brought-in materials = $40\n50% mark-up on cost = $20\nSelling price = $60\nTarget pricing\nTh is is best explained by an example. If a company has \ncosts of $400,000 when making 10,000 units of output and \nhas an expected rate of return of 20%, then it will set its \nprice by working out its total cost and expected return and \nthen dividing the amount by the output.\nTarget pricing:  setting a price that will give a required rate \nof return at a certain level of output\/sales.\nKEY TERM264Cambridge International AS and A Level BusinessExample 2:\nTotal output costs for 10,000 units = $400,000\nRequired return of 20% on sales = $80,000\nTotal revenue needed = $480,000\nPrice per unit 480,000\/10,000 = $48\nFull-cost (or absorption-cost) pricing\nHowever, it is not always easy to allocate or divide all of the \ncosts of a fi rm to a speci fi c product, especially if the fi rm \nmakes a range of products. It is especially di ffi  cult to allocate \nthe fi xed costs. Th e  m e t h o d  d i ff ers from mark-up pricing \nonly to the extent that a method of allocating fi xed costs \namong the various products being sold has to be found. See \nChapter 29  for more detailed coverage of this issue.\nFull-cost pricing:  setting a price by calculating a unit cost \nfor the product (allocated fixed and variable costs) and \nthen adding a fixed profit margin.\nKEY TERM\nExample 3:  A business makes industrial training DVDs \nand the annual overheads or fi xed costs are $10,000. Th e \nvariable cost of producing each DVD is $5. Th e business is \ncurrently producing 5,000 units per year. Th e total costs of \nthis product each year are:\n$10,000 + [5,000 \u00d7 $5] = $35,000\nTh e average or unit cost of making each DVD:\n$35,000\/5,000 = $7\nTh e business will have to charge at least $7 each in order \nto break even on each unit. If the fi rm now adds a 300% \nprofi t margin then the total selling price becomes $28.\nContribution-cost (or marginal-cost) pricing\nTh is method does not try to allocate the fi xed costs to \nspeci fi c products. Instead of this, the fi rm calculates a unit \nvariable cost for the product in question and then adds \nan extra amount that is known as a \u2018contribution\u2019 to fi xed \ncosts. If enough units are sold, the total contribution will be \nenough to cover the fi xed costs and to return a pro fi t.\nContribution-cost pricing:  setting prices based on the \nvariable costs of making a product in order to make a \ncontribution towards fixed costs and profit.\nKEY TERM\nExample 4: a fi rm produces a single product that has direct \ncosts of $2 per unit and the total fi xed costs of the fi rm are $40,000 per year. Th e fi rm sets a contribution of $1 per \nunit and so sells the product at $3. Every unit sold makes \na contribution towards the fi xed costs of $1. If the fi rm \nsells 40,000 units in the year, then the fi xed costs will be \ncovered. Every unit sold over 40,000 will return a pro fi t. \nTh us, if the fi rm sells 60,000 units, then the fi xed costs will \nbe covered and there will be $20,000 pro fi t made.\nObviously, it would be good for a fi rm if it produced \na range of products that all made a positive contribution \nto the fi xed costs. Th en each product is \u2018doing its bit\u2019 . As \na general rule of thumb, a product that makes a positive \ncontribution to fi xed costs should continue to be produced \nso long as there is spare capacity in the fi rm, it does not \ntake the place of a product with a higher contribution and \nthere is not another option that has a higher contribution. \nTh ere are many fi rms that have excess capacity and hence \nuse contribution-cost pricing to attract extra business that \nwill absorb the excess capacity.\nExamples are train companies, for which there is \nsubstantial excess capacity except in the morning and \nevening rush hours. Even then, trains tend to run almost \nempty in one of the two directions. Electricity and \ntelephone companies face the same sort of situation. When \nthis problem arises, some businesses are able to use price \ndiscrimination to increase demand during the low-use \nperiods \u2013 see below.\nExample 5:  A fi rm produces a single product that \nhas a variable cost per unit of $4. Th e annual fi xed \ncosts or overheads are $80,000. Th e fi rm decides on a \ncontribution of $2 per unit sold. Th erefore, selling price \nis $6. If the business sells 50,000 units in one year, the \ntotal contribution to fi xed costs becomes 50,000 \u00d7 $2 = \n$100,000. Th is exceeds the fi xed costs by $20,000 and so a \nprofi t of this amount has been made. Th i s  fi rm would have \nto sell at least 40,000 units per year in order to break \u00a0even.\nCompetition-based pricing\nCompetition-based pricing:  a firm will base its price \nupon the price set by its competitors.\nKEY TERM\nTh ere are a number of di ff erent possible scenarios in which \nthis approach can be used:\n\u25a0 Price leadership o ft en exists in markets where there is one \ndominant firm and other firms simply charge a price based \nupon that set by the market leader.\n\u25a0 Some markets have a number of firms the same size, but \nprices are still similar in order to avoid a price war. An \nexample of this would be the large petrol companies.26518: The marketing mix \u2212 product and price \u25a0 Destroyer pricing exists when firms note the price of \ncompetitors\u2019 products and then deliberately undercut \nthem in order to try to force them out of the market.\n\u25a0 Market pricing is where the price charged is based \nupon a study of the conditions that prevail in a certain \nmarket. This is sometimes also called consumer-based \npricing, because, when the market is studied, it is in many \nways the actions of consumers in that market that \nare actually being looked at. However, a study of the \nmarket is, in fact, more detailed than just looking at the \nresponses of the consumers. A number of di ff erent \npricing strategies come under the heading of market-\norientated pricing:\n\u274f Perceived-value pricing  ( c u s t o m e r - v a l u e  p r i c i n g )  i s  \nused in markets where demand is known to be inelastic \nand a price is placed upon the product that reflects its \nvalue, as perceived by the consumers in the market. \nThe \u00a0more prestigious the brand name, for example \nRolex watches, the higher the perceived value, and so \nthe higher the price that can be set.\n\u274f Price discrimination  takes place in markets where it \nis possible to charge di ff erent groups of consumer\u2019s \ndiff erent prices for the same product. An example of this \nwould be airline operators who charge many di ff erent \nrates for the same journey. Firms can price discriminate \nif there are di ff erent groups of consumers, with di ff erent \nelasticities of demand for the product, where the firm \nis able to avoid resale between the groups and when it \ndoes not cost too much to keep the groups of consumers \nseparate. Other examples of price discrimination include \nselling train and bus tickets more cheaply to children or \nthe elderly and setting di ff erent prices for products in \ndiff erent export markets.\n\u274f Dynamic pricing:  The increasing use of constantly \nchanging prices when selling goods to di ff erent \ncustomers \u2013 especially online through e-commerce.  \nE-commerce has become a \u2018hot spot\u2019 for dynamic \npricing models due to the way consumers can be \n\u2018separated by and communicated with\u2019 over the \ninternet. Consumers cannot tell what other buyers \nare paying and businesses can vary the price \naccording to demand patterns or knowledge that \nthey have about a particular consumer and their \nability to pay.\nDynamic pricing:  off ering goods at a price that changes \naccording to the level of demand and the customer\u2019s ability \nto pay.\nKEY TERM\nPricing strategies for new products\nTh ese are normally split into two di ff erent approaches \ndepending on the marketing objectives of the business.1 Penetration pricing\nFirms tend to adopt penetration pricing  because \nthey are attempting to use mass marketing and gain a \nlarge market share. If the product gains a large market \nshare, \u00a0then the price could slowly be increased. See \nFigure 18.9.\nPenetration pricing:  setting a relatively low price o ft en \nsupported by strong promotion in order to achieve a high \nvolume of sales.\nKEY TERM\n2 Market skimming\nTh e aims of this pricing strategy are to maximise short-run \nprofi ts before competitors enter the market with a similar \nproduct and to project an exclusive image for the product. \nIf rivals do launch similar products, it may be necessary \nfor the price of the original product to be reduced over a \nperiod of time. An example of this is pharmaceutical fi rms, \nwho are o ft en given a legal monopoly for a certain number \nof years for new drugs. Th ey are able to charge high prices \nin order to recoup their considerable investments in \nresearch and to make high pro fi ts. It is not uncommon \nfor them to lower their prices in the last year of their legal \nmonopoly in order to hold their market share when other \ncompanies enter. Th is is a typical example of market-\nskimming price strategy.\nMarket skimming:  setting a high price for a new product \nwhen a firm has a unique or highly di ff erentiated product \nwith low price elasticity of demand.\nKEY TERMTime0 PricePenetration\nSkimming\nFigure 18.9 Market-skimming and penetration pricing \nstrategies\n266Cambridge International AS and A Level Business","89":"Introduction\nTh e two components of the marketing mix considered \nso far have been product and price. No matter how good \nthe product or how attractive the prices to consumers, \nbusinesses have to communicate with customers \u2013 or \npotential customers \u2013 to persuade them to purchase the \ngood or service. Th is is the role of \u2018promotion\u2019. \u2018Place\u2019 \nrefers to how the product is sold to the customer \u2013 the \nchannel of distribution used from producer to consumer. \nBoth of these key elements of the marketing mix are being \ntransformed by technological change.\nWhy is promotion an important part of the \nmarketing mix?\nPromotion  is about communicating with actual or \npotential customers. E ff ective promotion not only \nincreases awareness of products, but can create images \nand product \u2018personalities\u2019 that consumers can identify \nwith. Advertising is only one form of promotion and \nother techniques include direct selling and sales-\npromotion o ff ers. Th e combination of all forms of \npromotion used by a business for any product is known \nas the \u2018promotion mix\u2019. Th e  a m o u n t  fi rms spend on \npromotion \u2013 the promotion budget \u2013 is o ft en a key \ndecision but successful communication is not just about \nthe total amount spent. It is also about how the budget \nis allocated between the competing forms of promotion \navailable \u2013 this is called the promotions mix. Th e \npackaging of products is o ft en considered as a separate \n\u2018P\u2019 in the marketing mix, but it is very closely tied to \npromotion and product imagery. Th i s  c h a p t e r  a l s o  t a k e s  \na closer look at the role of packaging in complementing \npromotional strategies.\nPromotion:  the use of advertising, sales promotion, \npersonal selling, direct mail, trade fairs, sponsorship and \npublic relations to inform consumers and persuade them \nto buy.\nKEY TERM\nPromotion objectives\nPromotion campaigns can be planned to achieve several \nobjectives. Th ese are all about communicating with the \ntarget consumers. Th ese aims can either be focused on \nthe short term \u2013 such as an increase in sales next month \u00a0\u2013 \nor on the longer term \u2013 such as to change the image of \nthe business. Th ese aims should be linked to the overall \nobjectives of the business.Promotional objectives aim to:\n\u25a0 increase sales by raising consumer awareness of a product \u2013 \nespecially important for newly launched ones\n\u25a0 remind consumers of an existing product and its distinctive \nqualities\n\u25a0 increase purchases by existing consumers or to attract new \nconsumers to the brand\n\u25a0 demonstrate the superior specification or qualities of a \nproduct compared with those of competitors \u2013 o ft en \nused when the product has been updated or adapted in \nsome way\n\u25a0 create or reinforce the brand image or \u2018personality\u2019 of \nthe product \u2013 this is becoming increasingly important \nin consumer markets, where it is o ft en  c l a i med  th a t  \u2018 al l \nproducts look the same\u2019\n\u25a0 correct misleading reports about the product or the \nbusiness and to reassure the consuming public a ft er a \n\u2018scare\u2019 or an accident involving the product\n\u25a0 develop the public image of the business \u2013 rather than the \nproduct \u2013 through corporate advertising\n\u25a0 encourage retailers to stock and actively promote products \nto the final consumer.\nTOP TIP\nWhen writing about promotion of a product, try to \nconsider the marketing objectives of the business. Is \nthe promotion being used likely to help achieve these \nobjectives?\nPromotion decisions \u2013 key issues\nThe promotion mix\nIt is most unlikely that just one method of promotion will \nbe su ffi  cient to achieve promotional objectives. Th e r e  a r e  \nseveral elements of the promotion mix . Th ey include all of \nthe marketing tools that can be used to communicate with \nconsumers.\nPromotion mix:  the combination of promotional \ntechniques that a firm uses to sell a product.\nKEY TERM\nAdvertising\nTh is form of promotion is sometimes referred to as \u2018 above-\nthe-line promotion \u2019.\nSo advertising  is communicating information about \na product or business through the media, such as radio, 274Cambridge International AS and A Level BusinessTV and newspapers. Th ese advertisements are usually \ndirected towards the appropriate target market by \nselecting the right media \u2013 but it is possible that many \npeople who are unlikely to purchase the product may see \nthe advertisements too. Successful advertising campaigns \nhave led to substantial increases in consumer awareness \nand sales, and this e ff ect can last for a considerable length \nof time if brand loyalty can be established.\nAdvertisements are o ft en classi fi ed into two types, but \nin practice this distinction is o ft en quite blurred.\n1 Informative advertising  \u2013 adverts that give information to \npotential purchasers of a product, rather than just trying to \ncreate a brand image. This information could include price, \ntechnical specifications or main features and places where \nthe product can be purchased. This style of advertising \ncould be particularly e ff ective when promoting a new \nproduct that consumers are unlikely to be aware of or \nwhen communicating a substantial change in price, design \nor specification.\n2 Persuasive advertising \u2013 adverts trying to create a distinct \nimage or brand identity for the product. They may not \ncontain any details at all about materials or ingredients \nused, prices or places to buy the product. This form of \nadvertising is very common, especially in those markets \nwhere there might be little di ff erenti ation between \nproducts and where advertisers are trying to create a \nperceived di ff erence in the minds of consumers. Perhaps, \nin reality, there is little di ff erence between these two styles \nof advertising: \u2018The more informative your advertising, the \nmore persuasive it will be\u2019 (David Ogilvy, Confessions of an \nAdvertising Man , New York: Ballantine Books, 1971).\nNot all advertising is aimed at the fi nal consumer. \nTrade advertising is aimed at encouraging retailers to \nstock and sell products to consumers and, if possible, to \npromote them in preference to rival products. Th i s  t y p e  \nof advertising is most likely to take place in trade journals \nand magazines not available to consumers.\nAdvertising agencies\nTh ese are fi rms who advise businesses on the most \neff ective way to promote products. Although expensive, \nthese specialists can o ff er a complete promotional strategy \nand this can be invaluable to a business that does not have its own marketing experts or to one that might be \nentering a new market for the fi rst time. Th e s e  a g e n c i e s  \nwill \u2013 for substantial fees \u2013 undertake the following stages \nin devising a promotional plan:\n\u25a0 Research the market, establish consumer tastes and \npreferences and identify the typical consumer profile.\n\u25a0 Advise on the most cost-e ff ective forms of media to be used \nto attract these potential consumers.\n\u25a0 Use their own creative designers to devise adverts \nappropriate to the media to be used.\n\u25a0 Film or print the adverts to be used in the campaign.\n\u25a0 Monitor public reaction to the campaign and feed this back \nto the client to improve the e ff ectiveness of future advice on \npromotion.\nAdvertising decisions \u2013 which media to use?\nCommunication with the public needs a message \nand a medium to transmit the message. Th e  b i g g e r  \nthe advertising budget, the more media choice there \nis. Limited resources will restrict options to the \ncheaper media. However, the most expensive forms \nof communication are not always the most e ff ective. \nTh e choice of media requires consideration of the \nfollowing \u00a0factors:\n1 Cost:  TV, radio and cinema advertising can be very \nexpensive per minute of advert. The actual cost will depend \non the time of day that the advertisements are to be \ntransmitted and the size of the potential audience. National \nnewspapers will be more expensive than local ones. Other \nmedia include posters and magazines. Marketing managers \nare able to compare the cost of these media and assess \nwhether they fall within the marketing budget. It must not \nbe forgotten that buying media time or space is not the \nonly cost. The advert still has to be written and produced \nand the use of celebrities in TV, radio or cinema adverts can \ngreatly increase the total cost. In contrast, viral marketing \nthrough social media can be virtually cost-free.\n2 Size of audience: This will allow the cost per person to be \ncalculated. Media managers will provide details of overall \naudience numbers at di ff erent times of da y or in di ff erent \nregions. Total numbers are of less importance than the \n\u2018profile\u2019 of the audience, as the advertisements need to be \ndirected towards potential customers only and not \u2018wasted\u2019 \non groups that are unlikely to ever buy the product.\n3 The profile of the target audience in terms of age, income \nlevels, interests and so on: This should reflect as closely \nas possible the target consumer profile of the market being \naimed for. For instance, there is likely to be little point in \nadvertising a new children\u2019s toy a ft er 10pm at night. Using \na mass-market, low-priced daily newspaper to advertise \na new range of exclusive clothing would be aiming at the \nwrong target. Younger consumers are likely to be most \naccessible via social media.Above-the-line promotion:  a form of promotion that is \nundertaken by a business by paying for communication \nwith consumers.\nAdvertising:  paid-for communication with consumers to \ninform and persuade, e.g. TV and cinema advertising.\nKEY TERMS\n27519: The marketing mix \u2013 promotion and place ","90":"Packaging\nTh e quality, design and colour of materials used in \npackaging of products can have a very supportive role to \nplay in the promotion of a product. Packaging can perform \nthe following functions:\n\u25a0 protect and contain the product\n\u25a0 give information, depending on the product, to consumers \nabout contents, ingredients, cooking instructions, assembly \ninstructions and so on\n\u25a0 support the image of the product created by other aspects \nof promotion\n\u25a0 aid the recognition of the product by the consumer.\nCheap and nasty packaging of goods such as clothes or \nchocolates will destroy any quality and status image \nthat the fi rm is attempting to establish. Distinctive \npackaging \u00a0can help to form the basis of a promotional \ntheme, which will endure as long as the product \u00a0\u2013 \nthe bright red of Coca-Cola cans is a feature of \nadvertisements for the product, while Pepsi is instantly \nrecognisable with blue cans.\nIn contrast, expensive and wasteful packaging \nmay add unnecessarily to costs that could reduce a \nproduct\u2019s competitiveness. In addition, with increasing \nenvironmental pressures, packaging that is seen to be \ntoo ostentatious or wasteful may spark o ff  a negative \nconsumer reaction. For this reason, the use of recycled \nand recyclable materials in packaging is increasing. \nSome packaging advances can revolutionise the sale \nand promotion of products. Wine is now sold in cans \nand plastic-coated boxes in addition to bottles. Tetra \nBrik (a registered trademark) boxes have given milk and \nfruit-juice manufacturers many new marketing and sales \nopportunities. As with all other aspects of marketing, \npackaging decisions need to be blended in with the \noverall objectives of the business for the product in \nquestion.\nWhy are \u2018place\u2019 decisions an important part \nof the marketing mix?\n\u2018Place\u2019 decisions are concerned with how products should \npass from manufacturer to the fi nal customer. Several \ndiff erent \u2018 channels of distribution \u2019 are available for fi rms \nto use.\nChannel of distribution:  this refers to the chain of \nintermediaries a product passes through from producer to \nfinal consumer.\nKEY TERMHere are some reasons why the distribution channel choice \nis important:\n\u25a0 Consumers may need easy access to a firm\u2019s products to \nallow them to try them and see them before they buy, to \nmake purchasing easy and to allow, if necessary, for the \nreturn of goods.\n\u25a0 Manufacturers need outlets for their products that give \nas wide market coverage as possible, but with the desired \nimage of the product appropriately promoted.\n\u25a0 Retailers \u2013 firms that sell goods to the final consumer \u2013 will \nsell producers\u2019 goods but will demand a mark-up to cover \ntheir costs and make a profit, so, if price is very important, \nusing few or no intermediaries would be an advantage.\nConcept of distribution\n\u2018Getting the right product to the right consumer at \nthe right time in a way that is most convenient to the \nconsumer\u2019 is a good de fi nition of distribution. Any \nbusiness, whether it produces goods or provides services, \nneeds to establish a distribution strategy that will de fi ne \nhow it is going to move products from the point of \ncreation to points of consumption in an e ffi  cient and \nlow-cost manner so that it is convenient for the consumer \nto buy. Th e term \u2018supply chain\u2019 is o ft en used to refer to \nall businesses involved in getting products to the fi nal \nconsumer \u2212 the producer and manufacturer, wholesalers, \ntransporters and retailers.\nCustomer service as objective of \ndistribution\nTh e  m a i n  p u r p o s e  o f  d i s t r i b u t i o n  i s  n o t  n e c e s s a r i l y  t o  a i m  \nfor lowest cost.

Th i s  w o u l d  b e  c h e a p e s t  f o r  t h e  \nfarmer \u2013 but would it be convenient for many potential \nconsumers? Probably not, as many busy consumers expect \nhome delivery or access to food products through local \nshops. A computer manufacturer may decide to only sell \nits products via the Internet and not to shops or other \noutlets. Again, this might be cheapest for the manufacturer, \nbut how good is the service being o ff ered to customers \u2013 \nespecially those without a computer to access the Internet?\nCost must be a factor in the distribution strategy used \nby any business, but it should not be the primary one. \nCustomer service is the key objective of distribution. \nGoods and services should be available to customers \nas and when they choose to purchase them \u2013 not at the \nconvenience of the producer. Later in this chapter, the \ndiff erent distribution channels will be analysed for their \npotential to provide good customer service.286Cambridge International AS and A Level Business","91":"What do these results mean?\n\u25a0 The own-label cereal is called an inferior good because it \nhas a \u2018superior\u2019 branded alternative and because quantity \ndemand rises as income falls \u2013 and falls when incomes rise. In \nthe case of products like these, income elasticity is negative.\n\u25a0 The expensive branded good is referred to as a normal good \nbecause we would expect that the demand for most products \nwould fall if consumers had less income to spend \u2013 and would \nrise when incomes increase. In the case of products like \nthese, income elasticity is positive.\n\u25a0 Salt is a necessity and has very low positive income elasticity.\nPromotional elasticity of demand\nPromotional elasticity of demand:  measures the \nresponsiveness of demand for a product following a \nchange in the amount spent on promoting it.\nPromotional elasticity of demand =\n % change in demand for the product\n% change in promotional spending\nKEY TERM\nIf the result is greater than 1, then, as with the other \nforms of elasticity already considered, demand is said to \nbe elastic or responsive following a change in spending \non promotion. If the result is less than 1, then demand \nis inelastic and there might be little point in increasing \npromotional expenditure.\nGenerally, it would be more e ff ective for a business to \nincrease spending on those products with a high promotional \nelasticity of demand and to cut back promotional spending \non those with a low elasticity. Much depends on the \neff ectiveness of the promotional campaign, however. Just \nbecause last year\u2019s advertising campaign was so successful \ndoes not guarantee success with higher sales this year if the \nstyle of the advert and the media used have changed.\nExample 2:  A business increases its advertising spending \non two of its products by 10%.

Th is will be the most crucial \nfew weeks or months in the life of the new product, and \nmarketing managers will await the newest sales-results \ndata with keen interest.\nResearch and development\nEff ective research and development  (R&D) is essential \nin some industries if a business is to keep at the forefront \nof its market and is to retain or recapture a competitive \nadvantage. Examples of fi rms that have improved their \nperformance with R&D include Apple, Hewlett-Packard, \nToyota and Honda.\nResearch and development:  the scientific research and \ntechnical development of new products and processes.\nKEY TERM\nThe significance of R&D and possible business \nstrategies\nInventions generate new product possibilities.

A willingness to work hard, keen \nambition to succeed, energy and focus are all essential qualities \nof a successful entrepreneur.\nMultiskilled:  An entrepreneur will have to make the product \n(or provide the service), promote it, sell it and keep accounts. \nThese di ff erent business tasks require a person who has many \ndiff erent qualities, such as being keen to learn technical skills, \nbeing able to get on with people and being good at handling \nmoney and keeping accounting records.\nLeadership skills:  The entrepreneur will have to lead by \nexample and must have a personality that encourages \npeople \u00a0in the business to follow them and be motivated \nby\u00a0them.\nSelf-confidence and an ability to bounce back:  Many \nbusiness start-ups fail, yet this would not discourage a true \nentrepreneur who would have such belief in themselves and their business idea that they would bounce back from \u00a0any \nsetbacks.\nRisk taking:  Entrepreneurs must be willing to take risks in \norder to see results.

Initially, he opened \ntwo greenhouses growing just roses. He used his \nown savings, so took a considerable risk, but his \nconfidence in the growth of flower-giving at times \nof major festivals encouraged other investors too. \nHe sold the flowers in India, but his business also \nbecame one of the first in India to start exporting \nflowers on a large scale. Rama worked long hours \nto make his business a success. The business, \ncalled Katuri Networks, has grown at a tremendous \nrate, helped by Rama\u2019s all-round business skills. \nHe recently bought out a large rose-grower in \nKenya and his business is now the world\u2019s largest \ncultivator of roses \u00a0\u2013 and Rama achieved this in a \nlittle over ten years.ACTIVITY  1.2\n[9 marks, 15 minutes]\n1 Rama is an example of a \u2018business entrepreneur\u2019. \nExplain what is meant by this term.

Many people say that they \u2018want to work \nfor themselves\u2019, but they do not make the leap into \nentrepreneurship successfully because they have not been \nable to identify a market need that will o ff er su ffi  cient 71: Enterprise business.

Whereas a website \ndesigner could operate from home very e ff ectively, as \ncommunication with customers will be by electronic \nmeans, a hairdresser may need to consider obtaining \npremises in an area with the biggest number of potential \ncustomers. An alternative is to visit customers in their own \nhomes \u00a0\u2013 this way, the entrepreneur may avoid the costs of \nbuying or renting their own premises altogether.\nCompetition\nTh is is nearly always a problem for new enterprises unless \nthe business idea is so unique that no other business has \nanything quite like it. A newly created business will o ft en \nexperience competition from older, established businesses, \nwith more resources and more market knowledge. Th e \nentrepreneur may have to o ff er better customer service \nto overcome the cost and pricing advantages that bigger \nbusinesses can usually o ff er.\nBuilding a customer base\nTh is is linked to the previous point about competition. To \nsurvive, a new fi rm must establish itself in the market \u00a0and \nbuild up customer numbers as quickly as possible. Th e  l o n g -\nterm strength of the business will depend on encouraging \ncustomers to return to purchase products again and again. \nMany small businesses try to encourage this by o ff ering \na better service than their larger and better-funded \ncompetitors.

In fact, many businesses fail during their \nfi rst year of operation. Th e most common reasons for \nnew enterprises failing are:demand for their product to allow the business to be \nprofi table. Th e original idea for most new businesses \ncomes from one of several sources including:\n\u25a0 O w n  s k i l l s  o r  h o b b i e s \u00a0\u2013 e.g. dress-making or car \nbodywork repairing. Very o ft en, these skills will enable an \nentrepreneur to o ff er them to friends and relatives and this \ncould be the start of the business.\n\u25a0 P r e v i o u s  e m p l o y m e n t  e x p e r i e n c e \u00a0\u2013 working for a \nsuccessful hairdresser, for example, allows a potential \nentrepreneur to see the working of such a business \nand judge whether they could set up a similar business \nthemselves.\n\u25a0 F r a n c h i s i n g  c o n f e r e n c e s  and exhibitions \u00a0\u2013 these o ff er a \nwide range of new business start-up ideas, e.g. fast-food \nrestaurants, which also give the potential benefits of the \nsupport of a much larger franchiser business.\n\u25a0 Small-budget market research \u00a0\u2013 the Internet allows any \nuser to browse business directories to see how many \nbusinesses there are in the local area o ff ering certain \ngoods or services. Such small-scale research might indicate \ngaps in local markets that could be profitably filled by the \nentrepreneur.\nSourcing capital (finance)\nOnce the entrepreneur has decided on the business idea \nor opportunity, the next task is to raise the necessary \ncapital. In an International Labour Organization survey \nof new business start-ups, the problem of fi nance came \ntop of the list of replies from entrepreneurs regarding the \nmain di ffi  culty.

This \nprovides protection to the inventor from unauthorised \ncopying of the new idea or design. If the idea proves to be \nvery popular with consumers, this means that the original \ninventor will be able to secure the profits from the product \nwithout fear of illegal copying.\n2 They can provide financial assistance to businesses \nengaging in R&D. This is usually done either by providing \ntax-reduction incentives, or by o ff ering grants to firms or \nuniversity departments with close links to industry, to be \nspent on specific projects.\nTOP TIP\nDo not assume that a firm\u2019s success will be guaranteed by \nspending more and more on R&D \u2013 some inventions will \nsimply not be commercially successful.\nInternational comparisons of \nR&D spending\nUK businesses spend less than their major competitors on \nR&D as a proportion of total sales.

Other businesses, such as hotels and hairdressing, would need \nto spend much less.\n\u25a0 The R&D spending plans of competitors:  In most \nmarkets, it is essential to spend as much as or more than \ncompetitors if market share and technical leadership are to \nbe maintained.\n\u25a0 Business expectations:  I f  b u s i n e s s  m a n a g e r s  a r e  \noptimistic about the future state of the economy and the \nrate of economic growth and consumer demand, then \nthey are more likely to agree to substantial budgets for \nR&D.\n\u25a0 The risk profile or culture of the business:  The attitude \nof the management to risk and whether shareholders are \nprepared to invest for the long term will have a significant \neff ect on the sums that businesses can inject into R&D \nprogrammes. \u2018Short-termism\u2019 is an accusation made \ntowards many major UK financial institutions, and the need \nto satisfy these investors could discourage managers from \ninvesting in R&D.\n\u25a0 Government policy towards grants to businesses and \nuniversities for R&D:  Programmes and the range and \nscope of tax allowances for such expenditure will influence \ndecisions by businesses.\nAircraft maker invests $200 million \nin new wings\nAirbus is spending $200 million at its Welsh factory \nto develop new materials for very light aircra ft  wings \nfor the planes of the future.

New ideas \noft en fail to reach the market because of defects in design \nor manufacture, competitors\u2019 products leaping ahead in \nterms of technology and higher-than-expected costs. Even \nwhen they are launched, they may still fail. Products can \nfail to progress at all stages of the product development \nprocess.

Both of these can create \nvalue  for a business.\nKEY CONCEPT LINK\nSales forecasting \u2013 potential benefits\nIf marketing managers were able to predict the future \naccurately, the risks of business operations would be much \nreduced. If a precise forecast of monthly sales over the \nnext two years could be made, the bene fi ts to the whole \norganisation would be immense:\n\u25a0 The production department would know how many units \nto produce and how many materials to order, distribution \nwould hold just the correct level of stocks.\u25a0 The marketing department would be aware of how many \nproducts to distribute.\n\u25a0 Human resources workforce plan would be more accurate, \nleading to the appropriate level of sta ff i n g.\n\u25a0 Finance could plan cash flows with much greater accuracy.\nIn reality, of course, such precision in forecasting is \nimpossible to achieve, because of all the external factors \nthat can greatly in fl uence sales performance. Consider, \nfor example, the di ffi  culties in forecasting, even for a \nshort-term period, the sales of DVDs from music shops. \nApart from changes in musical and fi lm tastes, new \ndevelopments in recording, download and playback \ntechnology will impact on DVD sales; the growth of \nInternet shopping, rather than buying from shops, and \nthe general economic climate will also have a great e ff ect \non future sales levels. Despite these problems, most fi rms \nmake sales forecasts in order to reduce to an acceptable \nminimum the unforeseen nature of future changes.\nMarket forecasts form an essential part of the market-\nplanning process and of the screening process before new \nproducts are launched onto the market. Th e s e  f o r e c a s t s  \nwill be based on market research data, gained from both \nprimary and secondary sources. For existing products, \nthere are two broad approaches towards sales forecasting. \nTh e fi rst approach is to ask the opinions of experts and \ncustomers and the second approach is to analyse past sales \nresults to try to use these to predict the future.\nSales-force composite\nSales-force representatives have the task of keeping in \ncontact with customers \u2013 usually not the fi nal consumers, \nbut the retail businesses that purchase and stock the \nproduct for sale to consumers. Frequent contact with \ncustomers means sales representatives are able to develop \na real insight into market trends and potential demand for \nthe future.

In \naddition, tea is still widely drunk in India and \nCoca-Cola\u2019s failure to adapt its global products to local \u00a0tastes is another major factor. Finally, most \nIndian retailing is still through informal unorganised \nstreet and market traders \u2013 and Coca-Cola is reluctant \nto see its products sold in this way. Perhaps this is one \nreason why it has recently set up a branded university \nin India to teach modern retailing techniques to \nmillions of small shop and stall owners.

Th e  k e y  f e a t u r e s  \nof globalisation that have an impact on business strategy are:\n\u25a0 increased international trade as barriers to trade are reduced\n\u25a0 growth of multinational businesses in all countries as there \nis greater freedom for capital to be invested from one \ncountry to another\n\u25a0 freer movement of workers between countries.\nAs with many major economic developments, globalisation \ncreates both potential opportunities and limitations to \nbusinesses (see Table 21.1  on page 320). Th i s  c h a p t e r  318focuses on the impact globalisation is having on marketing \nstrategies. Firstly, however, we consider the sheer scale of \nrecent globalisation and the wider impact that globalisation \nis having on business strategies.\nGlobalisation and the growth in \ninternational trade\nWorld trade \u2013 international trade between countries \u2013 has \ngrown in recent years. Th is has been a sign of increased \nglobalisation resulting from:\n\u25a0 the work of the World Trade Organization and its free-trade \nagreements\n\u25a0 the growth of regional free trade areas that allow no trade \nbarriers between member states, such as ASEAN, NAFTA \nand the EU.\nAveraging 7% growth per year in the decade to 2007, the \nrate of growth of world trade fell considerably a ft er 2008 \nas a consequence of the global fi nancial crisis and only \nreached 2.5% in 2013. Since 2001, Asian economies, led by China and India, have contributed 40% of total world \ntrade expansion. China\u2019s membership of the WTO \u00a0\u2013 \nthe World Trade Organization that negotiates regular \nreductions in world trade barriers \u2013 was one of the major \nfactors behind this rapid growth.

Improved communications, better transport \nlinks and freer international trade \u2013 all key features of \nglobalisation \u2013 have changed all this. For many fi rms, \ninternational marketing is now an opportunity to pro fi tably \nexpand their sales and, indeed, for some fi rms it is no \nlonger an option to remain based in just one country. Th i s  \nis the case for members of the European Union, where the \ngrowth of membership has led to increased competition \nfrom other countries and improved chances of successfully \nselling abroad. Th e rapid development of major developing \ncountries \u2013 the BRICS  \u2013 is leading to huge marketing \nopportunities for businesses prepared to sell their products \nand services in these international markets.\nInternational marketing:  selling products in markets \nother than the original domestic market.\nBRICS: the acronym for five rapidly developing economies \nwith great market opportunities \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, \nChina and South Africa.\nKEY TERMSWhy sell products in other countries?\n\u25a0 Saturated home markets \u2013 one country can have only \nso many fast-food restaurants. When the market stops \ngrowing and competition is severe, a move to another \ncountry, with few large competitors, can o ff er rapid sales \nincreases.\n\u25a0 Profits \u2013 rapid sales growth may be combined with low \ncosts of operation and create high profitability. If the \nforeign country has low labour and property costs and low \ntax levels, then selling from there to a high-cost country \ncan o ff er higher profit margins. In contr ast, the great \nwealth of some Arab oil states gives the opportunity to \nsome luxury goods producers to sell at higher prices than \n\u2018back home\u2019 .\n\u25a0 Spreading risks \u2013 international marketing means that the \nsales and profits of a business are much less dependent on \neconomic and legal constraints in the home country.\n\u25a0 Poor trading conditions in the home market \u2013 in 2013, \nsales of luxury cars in Spain fell due to the Eurozone \neconomic crisis, but sales in China continued to \nincrease.\n\u25a0 Legal di ff erences creating opportunities abroad \u2013 strict \nlegal controls on the selling and advertising of tobacco \nproducts in the USA and EU have encouraged most large \ncigarette manufacturers to target selling in emerging \nmarket economies with fewer restrictions. Profitable, \nyes \u2013 but how ethical is this?Potential benefits and strategic\nopportunitiesPotential limitations and threats\n\u25a0 There is greater opportunity for selling goods \nin other countries. Opening up new markets, \nwhich may not have reached saturation as the \ndomestic market may have done, gives the \nchance of higher sales, economies of scale and \nimproved profitability.\n\u25a0 Increased competition gives firms the incentives \nto become more internationally competitive. \nHiding behind trade barriers breeds ine ff iciency \nand this will no longer be possible.\n\u25a0 Pan-European or pan-global marketing \nstrategies can be used to create a global brand \nidentity. This saves on the costs of \u2018di ff erent \nmarkets \u2013 di ff erent products\u2019 .\n\u25a0 There is a wider choice of locations \u2013 the \nopportunity to set up operations in other \ncountries and become a multinational. These \nlocations o ff er, usually, lower costs and direct \naccess to local markets. Working within each \ncountry should lead to better market information.\n\u25a0 Greater freedom to arrange mergers and \ntakeovers with firms from other nations as \nrestrictions on foreign acquisitions are reduced.\u25a0 Businesses from other countries now have freer access to the \ndomestic market, so there will be increased competition.

She was lucky that her father \nwas prepared to invest $5,000 in it, but she would \nhave to find the rest of the capital needed \u00a0\u2013 about \n$10,000, she guessed \u00a0\u2013 from her own savings and \na bank loan. Her first step was to investigate the \nprices of shop premises and she was disappointed \nwhen she found out how expensive the city-centre \nlocations were. Her father suggested a cheaper but \nless busy out-of-town location. She contacted an \naccountant who o ff ered to look a ft er the financial \nside of the business, but he would charge at least \n$2,000 per year.

Industrialisation is the term used to describe \nthe growing importance of the secondary-sector \nmanufacturing industries in developing countries. The \nrelative importance of each sector is measured in terms \neither of employment levels or of output levels as a \nproportion of the whole economy. In many countries in \nAfrica and Asia, the relative importance of secondary-\nsector activity is increasing. This brings many benefits as \nwell as problems.\nBenefits\n\u25a0 T o t a l  n a t i o n a l  o u t p u t  ( g r o s s  d o m e s t i c  p r o d u c t )  i n c r e a s e s  \nand this raises average standards of living.\n\u25a0 Increasing output of goods can result in lower imports and \nhigher exports of such products.\n\u25a0 Expanding manufacturing businesses will result in more \njobs being created.\n\u25a0 Expanding and profitable firms will pay more tax to the \ngovernment.\n\u25a0 Value is added to the countries\u2019 output of raw materials, \nrather than just exporting these as basic, unprocessed \nproducts.\nProblems\n\u25a0 The chance of work in manufacturing can encourage a huge \nmovement of people from the countryside to the towns, \nwhich leads to housing and social problems.\n\u25a0 I m p o r t s  o f  r a w  m a t e r i a l s  a n d  c o m p o n e n t s  a r e  o ft en \nneeded, which can increase the country\u2019s import costs.\n\u25a0 Much of the growth of manufacturing industry is due to the \nexpansion of multinational companies. The consequences \nof this are covered later in this chapter.\n2 In developed economies, the situation is reversed. There \nis a decline in the importance of secondary-sector activity \nand an increase in the tertiary sector. This process is termed \ndeindustrialisation. In the UK, the proportion of total output \naccounted for by secondary industry has fallen by 15% to \n23% in 25 years. Reasons for this include:Country Primary Secondary Tertiary\nUnited Kingdom  2 19 79\nChina 42 26 32\nGhana 54 20 26\nTable 2.1 Employment data 2013 \u00a0\u2013 as percentage of total \nemployment\nPrimary production \u00a0\u2013 dairy farm in France\nSecondary production \u00a0\u2013 clothing factory in China\nTertiary sector \u00a0\u2013 the breath-taking Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai\nTh e balance of these sectors in the economies of di ff erent \ncountries varies substantially. It depends on the level of \nindustrialisation in each country. Table 2.1 shows the \ndiff erences between three countries.16Cambridge International AS and A Level Business\u25a0 Rising incomes associated with higher living standards \nhave led consumers to spend much of their extra income \non services rather than more goods. There has been \nsubstantial growth in tourism, hotels and restaurant \nservices, financial services and so on \u00a0\u2013 yet spending on \nphysical goods is rising more slowly.\n\u25a0 As the rest of the world industrialises, so manufacturing \nbusinesses in developed countries face much more \ncompetition and these rivals tend to be more e ff i c i en t  a nd \nuse cheaper labour. Therefore, rising imports of goods are \ntaking the market away from the domestic secondary-\nsector firms.\n3 The importance of each sector varies significantly \nbetween di ff erent economies. Table 2.1  gives details of the \ndiff erences that exist between three di ff erent countries\u2019 \neconomies and the share of total employment accounted \nfor by each sector of industry.\nPublic and private sectors\nIndustry may also be classi fi ed in other ways, for example by \npublic  or private sector  and by type of legal organisation. \nAs we shall see, these two types of classi fi cation are \ninterlinked, as some types of legal structure are found only \nin the private sector. What is the di ff erence between the \nprivate sector and public sector of the economy?\nPublic sector: comprises organisations accountable \nto and controlled by central or local government \n(the state).\nPrivate sector: comprises businesses owned and \ncontrolled by individuals or groups of individuals.\nKEY TERMS\nIn nearly every country with a mixed economy , most \nbusiness activity is in the private sector. Th e  r e l a t i v e  \nimportance of the private sector compared to the \npublic sector is not the same in all countries. Th o s e  \neconomies that are closest to a free-market  system have \nvery small public sectors. Th ose countries with central \nplanning command economies  will have very few \nbusinesses in the private sector.Command economy: economic resources are owned, \nplanned and controlled by the state.\nKEY TERM\nTh e types and sizes of businesses in the private sector can \nvary considerably. Th e  l e g a l  o r g a n i s a t i o n  o f  fi rms in the \nprivate sector is covered below. In most mixed-economy \ncountries, certain important goods and services are provided \nby state-run organisations as it is argued that they are too \nsigni fi cant to be le ft  to private businesses. Th e s e  u s u a l l y  \ninclude health and education services, defence and public \nlaw and order (police force). In some countries, important \nstrategic industries are also owned and controlled by the \nstate, such as energy, telecommunications and public \ntransport. In recent years, there has been a trend towards \nselling these o ff  to the private sector \u00a0\u2013 privatisation \u00a0\u2013 and the \nimpact of this policy is analysed on page  67.\nAnother re ason for the state or public sector to provide \ngoods or services rather than the private sector is the \nexistence of what economists call \u2018public goods\u2019. Th e s e  \nare goods and services that cannot be charged for, so it is \nimpossible for a private-sector business to make a pro fi t \nfrom producing them. A good example is street lighting. It \nis impossible to exclude people from obtaining the bene fi t \nof the streetlights if they have not contributed to paying for \nthem \u00a0\u2013 so why should anyone contribute directly towards \npaying for them? Th is means that taxes will have to be used \nto raise revenue to pay for a street-lighting system and this \nmeans that it can be provided only by the public sector.\nThe legal structure of business \norganisations \u00a0\u2013 the private sector\nFigure 2.1 on the next page shows the main types of \nprivate sector business.\nSole trader\nTh is is the most common form of business organisation. \nAlthough there is a single owner in this business \norganisation, it is common for sole traders  to employ \nothers, but the fi rm is likely to remain very small. \nBecause of this, although they are great in number, \nsole traders account for only a small proportion of \ntotal business turnover.

In the UK, it is possible to set up limited \nliability partnerships. It is usual, although not a legal \nrequirement, to draw up a formal Deed of Partnership \nbetween all partners.

Small fi rms o ff er many bene fi ts for \nthe dynamism of an economy and o ft en receive special \nassistance from governments. Even the world\u2019s greatest \ncompanies started o ff  as very small fi rms and the ways in \nwhich fi rms can expand and the impact of these forms of \ngrowth on stakeholders are the focus of the last section of \nthis chapter.29Measuring business size\nIt is common to compare businesses by their size. Who \nwants to know how large a particular business is? Th e \ngovernment might wish to give assistance to \u2018small\u2019 \nfi rms, so will need a measure of size. Investors in a fi rm \nmay wish to compare the size of the business with close \ncompetitors \u00a0\u2013 particularly in order to compare the rate \nof growth. Customers may prefer to deal only with large \nfi rms, assuming, perhaps, that they are more stable and \nless likely to cease production than smaller ones. Th e r e  a r e  \ntwo problems with these and other requirements for a way \nof measuring business size:\n1 T h e r e  a r e  s e v e r a l  d i ff erent ways of measuring and \ncomparing business size and they o ft en giv e di ff erent \ncomparative results. A firm might appear large by one \nmeasure but quite small by another.\n2 There is no internationally agreed definition of what a small, \nmedium or large business is, but the number of employees \nis oft en  used  to mak e  this distinction.\nDiff e r e n t  m e a s u r e s  o f  s i z e\n1 Number of employees\nTh is is the simplest measure. It is easy to understand \u00a0\u2013 for \nexample, it is obvious to everyone that a shop run by just \nthe owner or their family is small. It is also clear that a \nfi rm employing many sta ff  is likely to be large. However, \nthere are problems. How about a business that needs to \nemploy only a few people \u00a0\u2013 such as a highly automated \ncomputer-chip maker with expensive capital equipment?\nExample:  Th ere are two so ft  drink fi rms in the same \ntown. One uses traditional methods of production, using \n108 people to make 300,000 litres of drink a week. Th e \nother is totally automated and produces one million litres \na week with just ten \u00a0staff .\n2 Revenue\nRevenue  is oft en used as a measure of size \u00a0\u2013 especially \nwhen comparing fi rms in the same industry. It is less \neff ective when comparing fi rms in di ff erent industries \nbecause some might be engaged in \u2018high-value\u2019 \nproduction, such as precious jewels, and another might be \nin \u2018low-value\u2019 production, such as cleaning services. Th i s  \nmeasure is needed to calculate market share.\nRevenue: total value of sales made by a business in a \ngiven time period.\nKEY TERM3 Capital employed\nGenerally, the larger the business enterprise, the greater \nthe value of capital needed for long-term investment, \nor the greater the amount of capital employed . Again, \ncomparisons between fi rms in di ff erent industries may \ngive a rather misleading picture. Two fi rms employing \nthe same number of sta ff  may have very di ff erent capital \nequipment needs, such as a hairdresser and an optician. \nTh e latter will need expensive diagnostic and eyesight-\nmeasuring machines.\nCapital employed: the total value of all long-term finance \ninvested in the business.\nKEY TERM\n4 Market capitalisation\nMarket capitalisation  can be used only for businesses that \nhave shares quoted on the stock exchange (public limited \ncompanies). It is calculated by this formula:\nMarket capitalisation =  current share price \u00d7 \ntotal number of shares issued\nMarket capitalisation: the total value of a company\u2019s \nissued shares.\nKEY TERM\nAs share prices tend to change every day, this form of \ncomparison is not a very stable one. For example, a \ntemporary but sharp drop in the share price of a company \ncould appear to make it much \u2018smaller\u2019 than this measure \nwould normally suggest.\n5 Market share\nMarket share  is a relative measure. If a fi rm has a high \nmarket share, it must be among the leaders in the industry \nand comparatively  large. However, when the size of the total \nmarket is small, a high market share will not indicate a very \nlarge fi rm. Th i s  i s  c a l c u l a t e d  u s i n g  t h e  f o l l o w i n g  f o r m u l a :total sales of business\ntotal sales of industry\u00d7100\nMarket share: sales of the business as a proportion of \ntotal market sales.\nKEY TERM30Cambridge International AS and A Level BusinessOther measures that can be used\nTh ese will depend very much on the industry. Th e  n u m b e r  \nof guest beds or guest rooms could be used to compare \nhotel businesses. Th e number of shops could be used \nfor retailers. Total fl oor sales space could also be used to \ncompare retail businesses.\nTOP TIP\nProfit is not a good measure of business size \u00a0\u2013 but it can \nbe used to assess business performance.\nWhich form of measurement is best?\nTh ere is no \u2018best\u2019 measure. Th e one used depends on what \nneeds to be established about the fi rms being compared. \nTh is could depend on whether we are interested in absolute \nsize or comparative size within one industry. If an absolute \nmeasure of size is required, then it is almost certainly \nadvisable to test a fi rm on at least two of the above criteria \nand to make comparisons on the basis of these.\nTOP TIP\nIf asked to comment on data showing the sizes of \ndiff erent businesses, do remember that if another \nmeasure were used, the conclusions about relative size \nmight be very di ff erent.\nThe significance of small and \nmicro-businesses\nEven though we have not established a universally agreed \ndefi nition of small fi rms, it will be easy to identify them \nwithin your own economy. Th ey will employ few people \nand will have a low turnover compared to other fi rms. \nTh e  offi  cial de fi nition within your own country could be \ndiscovered from the trade and industry department. It is \nnow common to make a further distinction for very small \nbusinesses known as \u2018micro-enterprises\u2019. Th e  E u r o p e a n  \nUnion de fi nitions are shown in  Table 3.1.Small fi rms (including micro-enterprises) are very \nimportant to all economies and to the industry in which \nthey operate. Encouraging the development of small \nbusiness units can have the following bene fi ts:\n\u25a0 Many jobs are created by small firms and, even though each \none may not employ many sta ff , collectively the small-\nbusiness sector employs a very significant proportion of the \nworking population in most countries.\n\u25a0 S m a l l  b u s i n e s s e s  a r e  o ft en ru n b y dyn amic entrepreneu rs, \nwith new ideas for consumer goods and services. This helps \nto create variety in the market and consumers will benefit \nfrom greater choice.\n\u25a0 Small firms can create competition for larger businesses. \nWithout this competition, larger firms could exploit \nconsumers with high prices and poor service. The cost \nof air travel has been reduced in recent years due to the \nestablishment of many small airlines competing with the \nlarge, established companies.\n\u25a0 Small firms o ft en supply specialist goods and \nservices to important industries in a country. For \nexample, the global car industry is dominated by major \nmanufacturers such as Toyota, BMW and Ford. All of \nthese large businesses depend on small specialist \nsuppliers of on-board computers, high-quality audio \nequipment and headlights. Very o ft en, by being able to \nadapt quickly to the changing needs of large firms, small \nbusinesses actually increase the competitiveness of the \nlarger organisations.\n\u25a0 All great businesses were small at one time. The Body Shop \nbegan in one small rented store in 1976. Hewlett-Packard \nstarted assembling electrical equipment in Packard\u2019s \ngarage! The large firms of the future are the small firms \nof today \u00a0\u2013 and the more small firms are encouraged to \nbecome \u00a0established and expand, the greater the chances \nthat an economy will benefit from large-scale organisations \nin the future.\n\u25a0 Small firms may enjoy lower average costs than larger \nones and this benefit could be passed on to the consumer \ntoo. Costs could be lower because wage rates paid to sta ff  \nmay be less than the salaries paid in large organisations, \nor the sheer cost of the administration and management \nstructure of bigger enterprises may increase their costs \ndramatically.\nBusiness category Employees Revenue Capital employed\nMedium 51\u2013250 over \u20ac10m to \u20ac50m over \u20ac10m to \u20ac34m\nSmall 11\u201350 over \u20ac2m to \u20ac10m over \u20ac2m to \u20ac10m\nMicro 10 or fewer up to \u20ac2m up to \u20ac2m\nTable 3.1 EU classifications of business size313: Size of business ","100":"This chapter covers syllabus \nsection AS Level 1.4.\nobjectives of the business in their Memorandum of \nAssociation, but this o ft en lacks strategic detail.

Since \nsetting up the business called Health and Beauty for You \nwith her brother, Will, they had managed to keep the \nbusiness going through three very di ff icult years. When \nthey set the business up, they agreed that their first \nobjective was survival at all costs. Despite the country\u2019s \neconomic di ff iculties and some fierce competition, the \nbusiness had built up a good customer base and had \ncovered all of its costs for the first three years. Now the \npair had decided to plan for the next three years and \nthe first stage of this was to agree on new objectives for \nthe business. June wanted the business to grow and \nshe thought the best way to do this was to buy another \nbeauty salon in another area of the city. \u2018This will get \nthe business name really well-known and will give us \nthe basis for further sales growth of at least 20% a year,\u2019 \nshe told Will. He was not so sure he wanted the sta ff i n g \nand marketing problems associated with another salon. \n\u2018I\u00a0think we should aim to make as much profit as we can from the existing salon. I think we could aim for a profit of \n$40,000 per year. We could o ff er a wider range of services \nand increase our prices. A ft er  a l l,  w e  w en t  i n t o  b u s i n ess \nwith the intention of becoming rich!\u2019 he reminded June.\nAft er much argument, the pair agreed that the \nnew business objective should be, in the short term, \nto open a new salon and to double sales within three \nyears. A ft er this had been achieved, the aim should be \nto maximise long-term profits from the two locations \nby improving image and raising prices \u00a0\u2013 Will thought a \nfive-year target of $90,000 per year was realistic.\nPoints to think about:\n\u25a0 W h a t  d o  y o u  u n d e r s t a n d  b y  t h e  t e r m  \u2018 o b j e c t i v e \u2019 ?\n\u25a0 Do you think it is important that Health and Beauty for You \nshould have clear objectives? Explain your answer with as \nmany reasons as you can.\n\u25a0 Why do you think June and Will are thinking of changing \nthe objectives for their business over time?\nIntroduction\nBusinesses of any size can bene fi t from having clear \nobjectives or targets to work towards. In small sole-\ntrader businesses, these objectives are o ft en not written \ndown or formalised in any way, but the owners will o ft en \nhave a clear idea of what they are trying to achieve. In \npartnership organisations, it is important for partners \nto agree on the direction their business should take or \nfuture disagreements can cause much time to be wasted \nthat would be better spent on running the business \neff ectively. Limited companies must state the overall 38review the success of business activity. In addition, \nfor any aim to be successfully achieved, there has \nto be an appropriate strategy \u00a0\u2013 or detailed plan of \naction \u00a0\u2013 in place to ensure that resources are correctly \ndirected towards the fi nal goal. Th i s  s t r a t e g y  s h o u l d  \nbe constantly \u00a0reviewed to check whether the business \nis on target to achieve its objectives. Both the aims of \nan organisation and the strategies it adopts will o ft en \nchange over time. Indeed, a change of objective will \nalmost certainly require a change of plan too. A poor \nplan or strategy will lead to failure to reach the target \n(Unit 6  focuses on how businesses develop strategies to \nmeet their objectives).\nTh e most e ff ective business objectives usually meet the \nfollowing \u2018SMART\u2019 criteria:\nS\u00a0\u2013 Specific:  Objectives should focus on what the business \ndoes and should apply directly to that business. A hotel may set \nan objective of 75% bed occupancy over the winter period. This \nobjective is specific to this business.\nM\u00a0\u2013 Measurable:  O b j e c t i v e s  t h a t  h a v e  a  q u a n t i t a t i v e  v a l u e  a r e  \nlikely to prove to be more e ff ective targets for directors and \nstaff  to work towards. For instance, to increase sales in the \nsouth-east region by 15% this year.\nA\u00a0\u2013 Achievable:  Setting objectives that are almost impossible \nin the time frame given will be pointless. They will demotivate \nstaff  who have the task of trying to reach these targets. So \nobjectives should be achievable.\nR\u00a0\u2013 Realistic and relevant:  O b j e c t i v e s  s h o u l d  b e  r e a l i s t i c  w h e n  \ncompared with the resources of the company and should be \nexpressed in terms relevant to the people who have to carry \nthem out. So informing a factory cleaner about \u2018increasing \nmarket share\u2019 is less relevant than a target of reducing usage of \ncleaning materials by 20%.\nT\u00a0\u2013 Time-specific:  A time limit should be set when an objective \nis established \u00a0\u2013 by when does the business expect to increase \nprofits by 5%? Without a time limit, it will be impossible to \nassess whether the objective has actually been met.\nTOP TIP\nRemember the slogan: SMART.\nAims, mission statements, objectives and \nstrategies \u00a0\u2013 what do they all mean?\nTh e links between these concepts can be made clearer by \nstudying this \u2018hierarchy of objectives\u2019 ( Figure 4.1), which \nshows, visually, the balance and dependencies between the \ndiff erent stages in the setting of aims and objectives. Later \nin this chapter we will consider the importance of these \nobjectives to business strategies.Corporate aims\nTh ese are the very long-term goals that a business hopes \nto achieve. Th e core central purpose of a business\u2019s \nactivity is expressed in its corporate aims. Sole traders \nand partnerships \u00a0\u2013 not just companies \u00a0\u2013 will also \ncommonly develop the same kind of long-term vision for \ntheir \u00a0business.\nTh e case study demonstrates a typical corporate \naim. Daimler Mercedes-Benz tells us that it aims to \nachieve pro fi table growth by continuing to play a leading \nrole in the automobile industry. Other corporate aims \ntend to concentrate on customer-based goals \u00a0\u2013 such as \n\u2018meeting customers\u2019 needs\u2019 \u00a0\u2013 or market-based goals \u00a0\u2013 \nsuch as \u2018becoming the world leader\u2019.

Many, but not all, scientists think that prokaryotes evolved before eukaryotes and \nso are missing some cell components that eukaryotic cells possess.

It is mainly water and it holds other \ncomponents such as ribosomes.

However, unlike plant cell walls this is not made of cellulose. The cell membrane is found on the inside surface of the cell wall.\nSingle DNA loop (not in chromosomes)DNA in prokaryotes is not arranged in complex chromosomes  \nlike in eukaryotic cells.

They can be unicellular or belong \nto multicellular organisms. Eukaryotic cells almost always have a \nnucleus and are generally larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells.\nThe structure of a generalised animal cell is shown in Figure 1.6. \nA generalised cell is one that has been simplified to make the key \ncomponents easier to identify.\n\u25b2 Figure 1.6 A generalised animal cell as seen with a microscope (magnified \u00d74800) \nand as three- and two-dimensional diagrams.\nComponents of animal cells\nIn the previous section we looked at bacterial cells. Animal cells have \nmany components in common with these. The cytoplasm of animal cells \nis also mainly water and it holds other components such as ribosomes. \nIn the cytoplasm most of the chemical reactions in the cell happen \n(such as the making of proteins in ribosomes).\nThe cell-surface membrane of animal cells also surrounds the cell. There \nare no cell walls in animal cells and so the membrane is on the outside \nof these cells. The membrane controls what substances go in and out of \nthe cell. Many cells need glucose and oxygen for respiration, and these \nsubstances move by diffusion into the cell from the blood, where it is \nfound at a higher concentration. Carbon dioxide moves back into the \nblood capillaries through the membrane.\nMitochondria are small organelles found in the cytoplasm and are \nonly present in eukaryotic cells. They are the site of most of a cell\u2019s \nrespiration. Here the energy stored in glucose is released for the cell \nto complete the seven life processes. Without this energy all cells die. \nMore-active cells such as those in muscles or sperm cells usually have \nmore mitochondria because these cells need more energy. Mitochondria \nhave many folds inside them, which make their surface area very large \nto increase the rate at which energy is released.\nRibosomes are the site of protein synthesis. These organelles are \npresent in the cytoplasm of animal cells.\nKEy TERM\nDiffusion  The net movement \nof particles from an area of high \nconcentration to an area of lower concentration.\nnucleuscell surface\nmembrane\ncytoplasmmitochondria\nribosomes\nAnimal and plant cells\n11Animal cells are unlike bacterial cells in that they usually possess a \nnucleus. This component is present in almost all eukaryotic cells. It is \nfound in the cytoplasm and is surrounded by its own membrane. The \ncell\u2019s genetic material (DNA) is enclosed within it, arranged into shapes \ncalled chromosomes. (Red blood cells do not have a nucleus, so they \nhave more room to absorb and carry the maximum amount of oxygen, \nwhich is their main function.)\nHumans are of course classified as animals. Many of our cells are like \nother animal cells.\n\u25cf\u25cfGeneralised plant cells\nLike those belonging to animals, plant cells are eukaryotic. This means that \nthey may belong to single-celled or multicellular organisms, they do have a \nnucleus and they are generally larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells.\n\u25b2 Figure 1.7 A generalised plant cell as seen with a microscope (magnified \u00d72800) \nand as three- and two-dimensional diagrams.\nComponents of plant cells\nPlant cells have many components in common with animal cells, \nincluding a nucleus in which the organism\u2019s genetic material (DNA) \nis found. Plant cells also possess ribosomes for protein synthesis and \nmitochondria for respiration in their cytoplasm.\nPlant cells possess some components not present in animal cells. \nChloroplasts are small components, full of a green pigment called \nchlorophyll which is necessary for photosynthesis to occur. This reaction \nuses light energy from the Sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into \nglucose and oxygen and so provides an energy source for the plant. It is \nthe green chlorophyll in plants that gives some of their parts their green \ncolour. Most roots are hidden from the Sun and so cannot photosynthesise. \nThey do not have chloroplasts and so are often white, not green.\nThere are huge numbers of chloroplasts in leaf cells. There are often \nwell over half a million per square millimetre of leaf.\nPlant cells also possess a cell wall, unlike animal cells. This is made \nfrom cellulose and provides structure for the cell. Plants would not be \nable to stand upright to catch light energy from the Sun without cell \nwalls.

We have developed specialised cells that have adaptations \nto allow them to complete specific functions. Red blood cells, for \nexample, have a biconcave shape (which dips in the middle on both \nsides) and no nucleus to maximise their surface area to absorb more \noxygen. Key specialised cells for animals and plants, together with their \nadaptations, are listed below.\n\u25cf\u25cfSperm cell\nIn humans, during a male orgasm about a teaspoon of semen is ejaculated. Within this are tens of millions of sperm cells, which must \nswim through the cervix and uterus to the fallopian tubes. Here one \ncell may fertilise an egg cell (ovum). Sperm cells have a tail to propel \nthem towards the ovum (Figure 1.10). They have a relatively large \nnumber of mitochondria to release the energy from glucose during \nrespiration. This is needed to keep them swimming. The nucleus of a \nhuman sperm contains the genetic material (DNA) of the father. This \nwill make up half of the DNA of the baby. At the front of a sperm is an \nacrosome. This contains digestive enzymes, which break down the outer \nlayer of the ovum, allowing the sperm to enter and fertilise it.\n\u25cf\u25cfNerve cell\nOur nervous system controls and coordinates all our actions. These \ncan be either voluntary actions (like picking up the television remote \ncontrol) or involuntary actions (like our heart beating faster when we \nexercise). There are two main parts to our nervous system. The first is \nour central nervous system (CNS), which is made up of our brain and \nspinal cord. The other is our peripheral nervous system (PNS), which is  \nall the other nerve cells that connect to the CNS but then spread out across the body. To control our actions, signals must be sent and received.

Their long extensions are called axons and these \nhave a myelin sheath surrounding much of their length (Figure 1.11). \nThis acts like the plastic coating on an electrical wire and insulates the \nelectrical impulse. The cell body of the nerve also has smaller extensions \ncalled dendrites, which allow it to pick up signals from neighbouring cells.\n\u25cf\u25cfMuscle cell\n\u25b2 Figure 1.13 The three types of muscle.\nThere are three types of muscle in our bodies, all of which can contract and relax. Smooth muscle contracts and relaxes automatically and \nis found in places such as the linings of the vessels that make up \nour circulatory system and the iris of our eyes. Cardiac muscle also \ncontracts and relaxes automatically and is found in our heart. The third \ntype is skeletal muscle, which is usually found attached to our bones. \nWe control the contractions of this type of muscle, so its movements \nare not automatic.\nAll three types of muscle are made from muscle cells (Figure 1.13). \nThese are long thin cells full of mitochondria. In the mitochondria the \nenergy from glucose is released during respiration. This energy allows \nthe muscle to keep on contracting.\n\u25cf\u25cfRoot hair cell\nRoot hair cells have a small thin extension, which pokes out into the soil (Figure 1.14). Many plants \nhave such high numbers of long root hairs that they \ncan look like a spider\u2019s web. The purpose of these \nhairs is to increase the surface area of the root that \nis in contact with the soil. This allows the plant to \nabsorb more water and minerals from the soil. A \nsingle rye plant has billions of root hairs, which have \na total length of hundreds of miles. Without these \nit is likely that the adult plant would not be able to \nabsorb enough water to survive.\nKEy TERMS\nAxon  The extension of a nerve cell \nalong which electrical impulses travel.\nMyelin sheath  The insulating cover \nalong an axon, which speeds up the \nelectrical impulse.\nTIP\nMake a model of a bacterial, plant or animal cell and label it with the cell components and their functions to \nhelp you remember them (Figure 1.12).\n\u25b2 Figure 1.12 A model of a eukaryotic \ncell made from sweets.skeletal muscle\nsmooth muscle\ncardiac muscle\nsoil particles\nroot hairwater and mineral\nions ar e absorbed\nnucleusvacuolecellulose\ncell wall\n\u25c0 Figure 1.14 The parts of a root hair cell.Cell specialisation\n15\u25cf\u25cfXylem cell\nXylem cells form long tubes running along the stem or trunk of plants. \nThey are strengthened by lignin fibres. They carry water and some \ndissolved minerals from the roots upwards to other parts of the plant. \nThis water evaporates and is lost from leaves as water vapour during \nthe continual process of transpiration. It is also used in the green \nparts of plants for photosynthesis during the day. Xylem tubes are made \nfrom lots of individual cells that have died. The ends of these cells \nerode away, leaving long tubes through which water is naturally drawn \nupwards (Figure 1.15). They have reinforced cell walls to support the \nweight of the plant.\n\u25cf\u25cfPhloem cell\nPhloem cells carry the glucose (as sucrose) made in photosynthesis from the leaves of a plant to all other parts of the plant in cell sap. This process \nis called translocation. The sugar is used immediately in respiration to \nrelease energy for the plant or is stored as starch in cells or particularly in structures such as the roots of \nvegetables. Unlike xylem, phloem cells are living. They \nhave fewer cell organelles than many other types of \ncell, which allows the sugar to travel easily. Connecting \nadjacent phloem cells are sieve plates. These have small \nholes to speed up translocation (Figure 1.16).\nPhloem cells are arranged with xylem cells to form \nbundles. These make up the veins you can see in a leaf (Figure 1.17).\n\u25c0 Figure 1.17 The veins of a leaf are made from xylem tubes \ntransporting water to the leaf and phloem tubes transporting sugars away from it.\nKEy TERMS\nPhloem  Living cells that carry sugars \nmade in photosynthesis to all cells of a plant.\nTranslocation  The movement of \nsugars made in photosynthesis from \nthe leaves of plants.\nOrganelle  A part of a cell with a \nspecific function.\nKEy TERMS\nXylem  Dead plant cells joined \ntogether into long tubes through which \nwater flows during transpiration.\nTranspiration  The gradual release of \nwater vapour from leaves to continue \nthe \u2018pull\u2019 of water up to them from the soil.\ntranspiration\nof water\ncompanion\ncell\ntranslocation\nof sucr ose\n\u25b2 Figure 1.15 The parts of a xylem \ntube.\u25b2 Figure 1.16 The parts of a phloem tube.1 Cell biology\n16\u25cf\u25cfCell differentiation\nThe previous two sections have looked at generalised and specialised \nanimal and plant cells. After generalised cells are formed they become \nspecialised as an organism develops. This process is called cell \ndifferentiation. Your cells did this while you were in your mother\u2019s \nuterus. Part of this process involves cells developing specific structures \nwithin them to allow them to function. For example, muscle cells need \nto release lots of energy during respiration and so require a high number \nof mitochondria. Unlike animal cells, most plant cells retain the ability \nto differentiate throughout their life. We would not be able to take plant \ncuttings without this. You will learn about this in Chapter 14.\nMicroscopy\nIt is not very easy to know who invented the first microscope or exactly when this happened. It is likely to have occurred in the 1590s in the \nNetherlands by makers of eye glasses. Seventy-five years later, in 1665, \nEnglish scientist Robert Hooke published a book called Micrographia, \nwhich was full of impressive images including a drawing of the eyes \nof a fly using a microscope. In this book he first used the word \u2018cell\u2019, \nbecause when he looked at plant cells using his microscope he was \nreminded of the cells in a honeycomb.\nA decade later, in the mid-1670s, a Dutch scientist called van \nLeeuwenhoek discovered sperm cells and then single-celled bacteria \nfrom a human mouth. This was a tremendously important development \nin science, because before this no one had ever seen a single-celled organism.

Their long extensions are called axons and these \nhave a myelin sheath surrounding much of their length (Figure 1.11). \nThis acts like the plastic coating on an electrical wire and insulates the \nelectrical impulse. The cell body of the nerve also has smaller extensions \ncalled dendrites, which allow it to pick up signals from neighbouring cells.\n\u25cf\u25cfMuscle cell\n\u25b2 Figure 1.13 The three types of muscle.\nThere are three types of muscle in our bodies, all of which can contract and relax. Smooth muscle contracts and relaxes automatically and \nis found in places such as the linings of the vessels that make up \nour circulatory system and the iris of our eyes. Cardiac muscle also \ncontracts and relaxes automatically and is found in our heart. The third \ntype is skeletal muscle, which is usually found attached to our bones. \nWe control the contractions of this type of muscle, so its movements \nare not automatic.\nAll three types of muscle are made from muscle cells (Figure 1.13). \nThese are long thin cells full of mitochondria. In the mitochondria the \nenergy from glucose is released during respiration. This energy allows \nthe muscle to keep on contracting.\n\u25cf\u25cfRoot hair cell\nRoot hair cells have a small thin extension, which pokes out into the soil (Figure 1.14). Many plants \nhave such high numbers of long root hairs that they \ncan look like a spider\u2019s web. The purpose of these \nhairs is to increase the surface area of the root that \nis in contact with the soil. This allows the plant to \nabsorb more water and minerals from the soil. A \nsingle rye plant has billions of root hairs, which have \na total length of hundreds of miles. Without these \nit is likely that the adult plant would not be able to \nabsorb enough water to survive.\nKEy TERMS\nAxon  The extension of a nerve cell \nalong which electrical impulses travel.\nMyelin sheath  The insulating cover \nalong an axon, which speeds up the \nelectrical impulse.\nTIP\nMake a model of a bacterial, plant or animal cell and label it with the cell components and their functions to \nhelp you remember them (Figure 1.12).\n\u25b2 Figure 1.12 A model of a eukaryotic \ncell made from sweets.skeletal muscle\nsmooth muscle\ncardiac muscle\nsoil particles\nroot hairwater and mineral\nions ar e absorbed\nnucleusvacuolecellulose\ncell wall\n\u25c0 Figure 1.14 The parts of a root hair cell.","107":"1 Cell biology\n16\u25cf\u25cfCell differentiation\nThe previous two sections have looked at generalised and specialised \nanimal and plant cells. After generalised cells are formed they become \nspecialised as an organism develops. This process is called cell \ndifferentiation. Your cells did this while you were in your mother\u2019s \nuterus. Part of this process involves cells developing specific structures \nwithin them to allow them to function. For example, muscle cells need \nto release lots of energy during respiration and so require a high number \nof mitochondria. Unlike animal cells, most plant cells retain the ability \nto differentiate throughout their life. We would not be able to take plant \ncuttings without this. You will learn about this in Chapter 14.\nMicroscopy\nIt is not very easy to know who invented the first microscope or exactly when this happened. It is likely to have occurred in the 1590s in the \nNetherlands by makers of eye glasses. Seventy-five years later, in 1665, \nEnglish scientist Robert Hooke published a book called Micrographia, \nwhich was full of impressive images including a drawing of the eyes \nof a fly using a microscope. In this book he first used the word \u2018cell\u2019, \nbecause when he looked at plant cells using his microscope he was \nreminded of the cells in a honeycomb.\nA decade later, in the mid-1670s, a Dutch scientist called van \nLeeuwenhoek discovered sperm cells and then single-celled bacteria \nfrom a human mouth. This was a tremendously important development \nin science, because before this no one had ever seen a single-celled organism.

But the thing they have in common is that they all use \nmagnifying lenses to enlarge images.\n\u25cf\u25cfLight microscopes\nThe parts of a light microscope and their functions are shown in Table 1.2.\nTable 1.2 The functions of the parts of a light microscope.\nPart Function\nEyepiece lens You will look through this lens to see your sample. This is often \u00d710.\nObjective lens Usually there are three to choose from (often \u00d75, \u00d710 and \u00d725). The \nsmallest will be the easiest to focus, so select this first. When you have focused this lens try a different one with a greater magnification.\nStage This holds the sample securely, often using two metal clips.\nSpecimen This is usually placed in a drop of water or stain on a microscope slide under a very thin glass cover slip.\nMirror This reflects the light up through the sample, and then the objective and eyepiece lenses into your eyes.\nCourse focus This quickly and easily moves the stage up and down to focus on the sample.\nFine focus This sensitively and slowly moves the stage up and down to allow you to make your image very sharp.\nThe total magnification of the image you are looking at is calculated by:\ntotal magnification =  magnification of \u00d7 magnification of  \n   eyepiece lens       objective lens\n\u25cf\u25cfElectron microscopes\nElectron microscopes use electrons in place of rays of light to \nmake an image (Figure 1.19). The wavelength of electrons can be \nup to 100 000 times smaller than that of visible light. This means \nthat electron microscopes can take images at significantly higher magnifications. The first electron microscope was made by German \nscientists Ernst Ruska (1906\u20131988) and Max Knoll (1897\u20131969) in \n1931. This was a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Several years \nlater, in 1937, German scientist Manfred von Ardenne (1907\u20131997) \ninvented a second type called a scanning electron microscope (SEM). \nKEy TERMS\nElectron microscope  A microscope \nthat uses electron beams in place of \nlight to give higher magnifications.\nElectron  Negatively charged, tiny \nsubatomic particle that is found in \nshells surrounding the nucleus of an atom.\nTIP\nCopy out the table headings in the first row and column and test yourself by filling in the rest of the table from \nmemory. This will help you remember \nthe processes.\n\u25b6 Figure 1.19 A large modern electron microscope.\n1 Cell biology\n18Transmission electron microscopes fire a large beam of electrons though \na very thin slice of the specimen. All electrons are fired at the same \ntime. Not all of the electrons pass though the specimen. The image is \nmade from only those electrons that do.\nScanning electron microscopes also use a beam of electrons. This beam \nis much smaller and scans across the whole image but not all at the \nsame time. Electrons scatter from the surface of the sample and are \ndetected to make an image.\nAs a consequence of their different methods of working, the images that \nthese two microscopes take are very different from each other. Images from \ntransmission electron microscopes are flat and are usually taken in cross-\nsection through a specimen. That is, they are frequently used to look at \na section through a cell. Scanning electron microscopes don\u2019t need thin \nsamples so can be used to take images that look more three-dimensional. \nAll electron microscope images are black and white. On occasions scientists \ncolour these images to make them look more striking (Figure 1.20).\nThe resolution of microscopes is defined as the shortest distance \nbetween two parts of a specimen that can be seen as two distinctly \nseparate points. As a result of the wavelength of light the maximum \nresolution of light microscopes is 200 nm. (There are one million \nnanometres (nm) in a millimetre.) The wavelength of electrons is shorter than that of light, and so much closer points can be resolved. \nAn electron microscope can resolve points up to 2000 times closer than \na light microscope, at a separation of just 0.1 nm.\nKEy TERM\nResolution  The smallest distance \nbetween two separate points.\nTest yourself\n13 State the range of magnification you might see in a light microscope.\n14 State the resolution of an electron microscope.\n15 Describe why electron microscopes have greater magnification.\n16 Describe a disadvantage of using an electron microscope.\nExplain why scanning electron \nmicroscopes can take images that look three-dimensional.Show you can...\n\u25b2 Figure 1.20 (a) A three-dimensional image of an ant\u2019s head taken with a scanning electron microscope.

They can be unicellular or belong \nto multicellular organisms. Eukaryotic cells almost always have a \nnucleus and are generally larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells.\nThe structure of a generalised animal cell is shown in Figure 1.6. \nA generalised cell is one that has been simplified to make the key \ncomponents easier to identify.\n\u25b2 Figure 1.6 A generalised animal cell as seen with a microscope (magnified \u00d74800) \nand as three- and two-dimensional diagrams.\nComponents of animal cells\nIn the previous section we looked at bacterial cells. Animal cells have \nmany components in common with these. The cytoplasm of animal cells \nis also mainly water and it holds other components such as ribosomes. \nIn the cytoplasm most of the chemical reactions in the cell happen \n(such as the making of proteins in ribosomes).\nThe cell-surface membrane of animal cells also surrounds the cell. There \nare no cell walls in animal cells and so the membrane is on the outside \nof these cells. The membrane controls what substances go in and out of \nthe cell. Many cells need glucose and oxygen for respiration, and these \nsubstances move by diffusion into the cell from the blood, where it is \nfound at a higher concentration. Carbon dioxide moves back into the \nblood capillaries through the membrane.\nMitochondria are small organelles found in the cytoplasm and are \nonly present in eukaryotic cells. They are the site of most of a cell\u2019s \nrespiration. Here the energy stored in glucose is released for the cell \nto complete the seven life processes. Without this energy all cells die. \nMore-active cells such as those in muscles or sperm cells usually have \nmore mitochondria because these cells need more energy. Mitochondria \nhave many folds inside them, which make their surface area very large \nto increase the rate at which energy is released.\nRibosomes are the site of protein synthesis. These organelles are \npresent in the cytoplasm of animal cells.\nKEy TERM\nDiffusion  The net movement \nof particles from an area of high \nconcentration to an area of lower concentration.\nnucleuscell surface\nmembrane\ncytoplasmmitochondria\nribosomes\nAnimal and plant cells\n11Animal cells are unlike bacterial cells in that they usually possess a \nnucleus. This component is present in almost all eukaryotic cells. It is \nfound in the cytoplasm and is surrounded by its own membrane. The \ncell\u2019s genetic material (DNA) is enclosed within it, arranged into shapes \ncalled chromosomes. (Red blood cells do not have a nucleus, so they \nhave more room to absorb and carry the maximum amount of oxygen, \nwhich is their main function.)\nHumans are of course classified as animals. Many of our cells are like \nother animal cells.\n\u25cf\u25cfGeneralised plant cells\nLike those belonging to animals, plant cells are eukaryotic. This means that \nthey may belong to single-celled or multicellular organisms, they do have a \nnucleus and they are generally larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells.\n\u25b2 Figure 1.7 A generalised plant cell as seen with a microscope (magnified \u00d72800) \nand as three- and two-dimensional diagrams.\nComponents of plant cells\nPlant cells have many components in common with animal cells, \nincluding a nucleus in which the organism\u2019s genetic material (DNA) \nis found. Plant cells also possess ribosomes for protein synthesis and \nmitochondria for respiration in their cytoplasm.\nPlant cells possess some components not present in animal cells. \nChloroplasts are small components, full of a green pigment called \nchlorophyll which is necessary for photosynthesis to occur. This reaction \nuses light energy from the Sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into \nglucose and oxygen and so provides an energy source for the plant. It is \nthe green chlorophyll in plants that gives some of their parts their green \ncolour. Most roots are hidden from the Sun and so cannot photosynthesise. \nThey do not have chloroplasts and so are often white, not green.\nThere are huge numbers of chloroplasts in leaf cells. There are often \nwell over half a million per square millimetre of leaf.\nPlant cells also possess a cell wall, unlike animal cells. This is made \nfrom cellulose and provides structure for the cell. Plants would not be \nable to stand upright to catch light energy from the Sun without cell \nwalls. The cell surface membrane is found inside the cell wall.\nKEy TERM\nPhotosynthesis  An endothermic \nreaction that occurs in the \nchloroplasts of plants and algae and \nstores energy in glucose.\nmitochondria\nnucleuscell surface \nmembranecell wallchlor oplastsvacuolecytoplasm\nribosomes\n\u25b2 Figure 1.8 The structure of a \nchloroplast (magnification about \u00d715 000)."}}
