All sugars can be classified as reducing or non-reducing. The Benedict's test tests for sugars \u2014 it differs depending on the type of sugar you are testing for.1)2)3)Reducing sugars include all monosaccharides (e.g. glucose) and some disaccharides (e.g. maltose and lactose).You add Benedict's reagent (which is blue) to a sample and heat it in a water bath that's been brought to the boil.If the test's positive it will form a coloured precipitate (solid particles suspended in the solution).The colour of the precipitate changes from:blue-\u00a3> green>=>-yellowH>orange=4> brick redr Alwars us\u00ab an excess of r Z Benedict's solution \u2014 ;Z thls mak\u00ab sure that all ~ Z the sugar reacts. z1 1 1 \" I I I I I I M M | | | V\\N4)The higher the concentration of reducing sugar, the further the colour change goes \u2014 you can use this to compare the amount of reducing sugar in different solutions. A more accurate way of doing this is to filter the solution and weigh the precipitate.C\/1d\u00a3<UD1X1UZuDOLUIzO1) If the result of the reducing sugars test is negative, there could still be a non-reducing sugar present. To test for non-reducing sugars, like sucrose, first you have to break them down into monosaccharides.2) You do this by getting a new sample of the test solution, adding dilute hydrochloric acid and carefully heating it in a water bath that's been brought to the boil. You then neutralise it with sodium hydrogencarbonate. Then just carry out the Benedict's test as you would for a reducing sugar.3) If the test's positive it will form a coloured precipitate (as for the reducing sugars test). If the test's negative the solution will stay blue, which means it doesn't contain any sugar (either reducing or non-reducing).Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","2":"34Cell Division \u2014 Investigating MitosisIt's time to dust off your lab coat and get out your safety specs. Here are all the techniques you need to study mitosis. You'll need to know how to stain root cells on slides and how to use an optical microscope and graticules.Root Tips Can be Stained and Squashed to Observe MitosisYou need to know how to prepare and stain a root tip in order to observe the stages of mitosis. Make sure you're wearing safety goggles and a lab coat before you start. You should also wear gloves when using stains.1)2)3)4)5)6) 7)Stained Root Cells8)9)Cut 1 cm from the tip from a growing root (e.g. of an onion). It needs to be the tip because that's where growth occurs (and so that's where mitosis takes place).If you're using ethano-orcein to stain the cells, the tips will also need to be fixed in ethanoic acid.Prepare a boiling tube containing 1 M hydrochloric acid and put it in a water bath at 60 \u00b0C. Transfer the root tip into the boiling tube and incubate for about 5 minutes.Use a pipette to rinse the root tip well with cold water. Leave the tip to dry on a paper towel.Place the root tip on a microscope slide and cut 2 mm from the very tip of it. Get rid of the rest.Use a mounted needle to break the tip open and spread the cells out thinly.Add a few drops of stain and leave it for a few minutes.The stain will make the chromosomes easier to see under a Telophase microscope. There are loads of different stains, all with crazy names (toluidine blue O, ethano-orcein, Feulgen stain...If you're using the beulgen stain, you'll need an extra rinse.Place a cover slip over the cells and push down firmly to squash the tissue. This will make the tissue thinner and allow light to pass through it. Don't smear the cover slip sideways (or you'll damage the chromosomes).Now you can look at all the stages of mitosis under an optical microscope (see below).

You'll also need to label your drawing.High and low power objective lensesThe Mitotic Index Is the Proportion of Cells Undergoing MitosisYou can calculate the mitotic index of your cells using this formula:mitotic index =number of cells with visible chromosomes total number of cells observedThis lets you work out how quickly the tissue is growing and if there's anything weird going on. A plant root tip is constantly growing, so you'd expect a high mitotic index (i.e. lots of cells in mitosis). In other tissue samples, a high mitotic index could mean that tissue repair is taking place or that there is cancerous growth in the tissue.Topic 2 A \u2014 Cell Structure and Division\n","3":"1CSPECIFICATION \nREFERENCE1  RISK,  CORRELATION AND CAUSE1.17 1.15\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n\u25fc Under stand why people\u2019s perception of risks is often different from the actual risks, including underestimating and \noverestimating the risks due to diet and other lifestyle factors in the development of heart disease.\n\u25fc\n Be a\nble to distinguish between correlation and causation.\nEvery country has diseases which affect its people and may even kill them. Some of  these diseases \naffect you randomly \u2013 there is nothing you can do to change whether you are affected or not. However, for many diseases, especially non-communicable (non-infectious) conditions such as heart disease \nand cancer, you can increase or lower your risk of  becoming ill, based on factors in your lifestyle. If  you understand the risk factors, you can help to make yourself  and your family healthier.\nWHAT IS RISK?\nThe word risk is used regularly in everyday conversation, but in science it has a very specific meaning. In science, risk describes the probability that an event will happen. Probability means the chance or likelihood of  the event, calculated mathematically. For example, imagine you have six coloured balls \u2013 red, blue, green, yellow, orange and purple \u2013 in a black cloth bag (see fig A). If  you reach in and pull out a single ball, the probability (risk) of  getting, say, a green ball can be expressed in one of  three ways:\n \u20221 in 6\n \u20220.166\n 66 r\necurring (0.17)\n \u202217%.\nT\nhis is the case for any one of  the six colours in the bag. In the same way, it is possible to work out \nyour risk of  developing certain specified diseases or of  dying from a specified cause. \nHOW DO WE PERCEIVE RISK? \nThe actual risk of  doing something is not always the same as the sense of  risk one feels. Most people don\u2019t think twice before getting into their car \u2013 but globally you have an annual risk of  1 in 5747 of  being killed in a road traffic accident. On the other hand, many people get very worried before flying, but commercial flights have a 1 in 4.5\u20135.5\u00a0million risk of  crashing. Personal perception of  risk is based on a variety of  factors which include: \n \u2022ho\nw familiar you are with the activity \n \u2022ho\nw much you enjoy the activity\n \u2022w\nhether or not you approve of  the activity. \nThe actual mathematical risk may play very little part in developing your personal perception of  risk. People often overestimate the benefits, or minimise the risk, of  behaviour that they want to continue. For example, there is now strong evidence from around the world that obesity is linked to a range of  diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers. However, people like eating and so they still become overweight. On the other hand, they will over-emphasise the risks of  activities if  they want to avoid them or prevent others from doing them. For example, parents over-emphasise the risk of  wandering away to small children, to help make the child behave and stay close.\nIn another example, there is good scientific evidence that smoking affects our risk of  developing \ndiseases such as atherosclerosis, as well as lung cancer. However, knowledge of  the mathematical risk of  an early death if  you smoke cigarettes doesn\u2019t always stop people from smoking.\u25b2 fig A  T he risk, chance or \nprobability that you will pick a blue ball out of the black bag is 1 in 6. If\u00a0you return the ball to the bag each time, you will have exactly the same probability of picking a blue ball again the next time. The probability will always be 1\u00a0in 6.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

But the risk is higher for some people than others, depending on their lifestyle and which genes they inherit.\nIt is possible to identify the risk factors that may contribute to \nthe cause of  a disease. Y ou can look at people who have the same factors (e.g. smoking) and compare their risk of  the disease with the average risk for the whole population. Using these techniques, it appears that there are a number of  factors that increase the likelihood that a person will develop atherosclerosis. If  many factors influence your chance of  having a disease, it is called a multifactorial disease. The study of  the patterns of  diseases and their causes is called epidemiology.\nWhen two different sets of  data change together, there may be a \nlink, which is called a correlation. For example, mortality data from a disease such as atherosclerosis may change in a similar pattern to a lifestyle factor such as smoking or lack of  exercise. However, this does not prove that one is the cause of  the other. They could both be caused by something else which would explain why they change in the same way. Correlation is not the same as causation \u2013 further research is always needed to demonstrate a causal link.\nFor example, fig B shows the percentage of  deaths in the  \nUAE from cardiovascular disease each year. It also shows the statistics for obesity and diabetes. This data suggests a possible correlation between obesity and heart disease. \nDeaths from CVD05101520253035404550\nObesePercentage of the population affected\nOverweight Diabetes33%47.5%\n13%31%\n\u25b2 fig B  T his data shows a possible correlation between obesity, diabetes \nand death from cardiovascular disease (CVD).

However, \nthese UAE data agree with findings from countries around the world that suggest obesity is closely linked to the development of  diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Dr Raghib Ali, principle investigator in the UAE Healthy Future Study, has set up a long-term study in Abu Dhabi. The team is aiming to collect the data needed to confirm the pattern of  increased disease risk in the UAE \u2013 and so to find ways of  reducing the risk of  diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\nCHECKPOINT \n1.

Eat fruit and vegetables, drink orange juice, take lots of  exercise, enjoy these foods \u2013 how do we know which advice is based on good science, and which is given to us because someone wants to sell us something? There are many ways in which you can evaluate the design of  studies to decide if  the data are meaningful.\nDESIGNING STUDIES\nMost epidemiological studies are based on a very big sample size \u2013 usually, the bigger the study, the more meaningful the results. \nThe ideal is to investigate one factor or variable, keeping all other \nvariables the same (controlled). However, controlling variables is almost impossible when you are working with human beings. The way people live is complex and varies a lot, so it is hard to detect how any one factor affects people. When a larger number of  people are studied, it is more likely that patterns may emerge, even with all the other differences between the people involved. Evidence based on large amounts of  data is more likely to be statistically significant than evidence based on small studies.\nSome epidemiological studies are carried out over a long time. \nThese longitudinal studies are very valuable because they follow the same group of  individuals over many years (see fig\u00a0A). This means the impact of  their known lifestyle on their health can be tracked over time. For example, the M\u00fcnster Heart Study looked at cardiovascular disease in 10\n 856 men a\nged 36\u201365 in \nEurope, following them from the start of  the study well into the 21st century. The results from this study are still seen as important because so many people were involved over a long period of  time. The Framingham Study in the US also provided much data \u2013 but was limited because they were all from similar American citizens. The study started in 1948 and it is still going on \u2013 the scientists have widened the population they gather data from, so it is more relevant now.\nAn ambitious new study called the National Children\u2019s Study has \nbeen set up in the US to follow 100\n 000 childr\nen from birth until \nthey are 21 years old. From 2008\u20132012, children were selected to be representative of  the whole of  the US population. One major objective of  the study is to examine how environmental inputs and genetic factors interact to affect the health and development of  children. This is believed to be the biggest longitudinal study ever set up. Similarly, the UAE Healthy Future Study will be longitudinal, looking at the same group of  volunteers over a number of  years.\nSometimes, scientists look at all the available studies in a subject \narea and analyse the available data in a massive literature study. This combines small and large studies and can give more reliable evidence than any one of  the studies alone. This is called a metadata analysis (meta-analysis).\nEVALUATING SCIENTIFIC STUDIES\nWhen considering a study, you need to examine the methodology to see if  it is valid. That means that it is properly designed to answer the question or questions being asked. Y ou also need to see if  the measurements have been carried out with precision. It is important to find out if  other scientists have been able to repeat the methodology and have had similar results \u2013 if  so, the results are considered more reliable.\nIt is also important to know who carried out the research, who \nfunded it and where it was published. Then to decide whether or not any of  these factors might have affected or biased the study. Y ou need to evaluate the data and conclusions from the study in the light of  all these factors.\nEXAM HINT\nRemember the meaning of the following terms.\nValid: answers the question the scientists are askingPrecise: measurements with little difference between themReliable: the investigation is repeatable by other scientists who get \nsimilar results\nThey are important in evaluating all practical work and research.\nIn the next few pages, you are going to look at some of  the \nevidence that scientists have collected suggesting factors that may \u2013 or may not \u2013 affect your risk of  developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In each case, you need to look carefully at the type of  evidence that is presented and think about what else you need to know to make firm conclusions.\nRISK FACTORS FOR CVDs\nThe results from many epidemiological studies have identified a range of  risk factors linked to CVDs. These factors divide into two main groups \u2013 those you can\u2019t change and those you can do something about (see Section 1C.3).\nNON-MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS FOR ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nThere are three main risk factors for CVDs which cannot (at the present time) be changed.\n \u2022Genes\n: studies show that there is a genetic tendency (trend) \nin some families, and also in some ethnic groups, to develop CVDs. These trends can include\u2013\n ar\nteries which are easily damaged\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

This can make you more likely \nto suffer from CVDs, particularly heart disease.\n \u2022Gender\n: statistically, under the age of  50, men are more likely \nto suffer from heart disease (and other CVDs) than women. The female hormone oestrogen, which is an important factor in the woman\u2019s menstrual cycle, appears to reduce the build-up of  plaque. This gives women some protection against CVDs until they go through the menopause when oestrogen levels fall.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that risk factors do not cause the disease, they contribute \nto the chances of developing the disease.\nLOOKING AT THE DATA\nIdentical twin studies are an excellent resource when investigating \nwhether there is a genetic factor at work, because identical twins have exactly the same genes. Any differences should therefore be due to the environment in which they live. A major twin study was conducted in Sweden and was based on over 21\n 000 pair\ns of  twins, \nboth identical and non-identical. This study showed that (for male twins) if  one twin died of  heart disease between the ages of  36 and 55, then the risk of  the other twin also dying of  heart disease was eight times higher than if  neither was affected (see fig A). However, as the twins got older, one dying of  heart disease had less of  a correlation with the other twin also dying of  heart disease. In other words, there appears to be a clear genetic link to heart disease in younger men, but it gets less in much older men. \nEpidemiological studies have also identified several lifestyle \nfactors linked to CVDs, some of  which you will look at in the following pages. These lifestyle factors are important for health because they are the factors that we can change.\nCHECKPOINT \nSKILLS EXECUTIVE FUNCTION\n1.

Y our lifestyle can affect your \nrisk of  developing atherosclerosis in the future. Epidemiological studies have shown links with smoking, diet and weight, lack of  activity and high blood pressure. These are the factors we can change, so we can change our risk of  developing CVDs by the lifestyle choices we make.\nSMOKING AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nStudies have shown that smokers are far more likely to develop atherosclerosis than non-smokers with a similar lifestyle. Nine out of  ten people who need heart bypass surgery or stents as a result of  atherosclerosis are smokers. In 2007, a Spanish study showed a clear correlation between smoking and the incidence of  death from atherosclerotic heart disease. Causation was established by further research. For example, studies found that the substances in tobacco smoke:\n \u2022can dama\nge the artery linings, which makes the build-up of  plaques more likely\n \u2022can cause the ar\nteries to narrow, raise the blood pressure and increase the risk of  atherosclerosis.\nSimilar findings were made in a study on adults with heart disease in Jordan in 2017 (see fig B).1.16 1.12\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

A study of  10\n 269 male Har\nvard University (USA) graduates aged between \n45 and 84 showed that the men who changed from being inactive to taking regular exercise had a 23% lower mortality over the life of  the study than those who did not exercise. Moreover, the main cause of  the deaths was atherosclerosis and the linked CVDs. A study of  72\n 488 f\nemale nurses \nshowed the same benefits for women \u2013 the more active women had a significantly lower risk of  developing atherosclerosis and other CVDs. \nA 2013 study from Sri Lanka showed a similar pattern \u2013 high levels of  inactivity were linked to an \nincreased risk of  obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and CVDs. High levels of  activity were linked to a reduced risk of  all these conditions. Several studies have shown that exercise both reduces the formation of  plaques in the arteries and also keeps plaques that are present more stable and less likely to break.\nHIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nAs you saw in Section 1B.4, the heart pumps blood out into your arteries in a regular rhythm. The blood travels through your arterial system at pressures which change as your heart beats and which are easily measured (see fig C). At systole, when the blood is forced out of  the heart, a healthy blood pressure is around 120\n mmHg\n. When the heart is relaxed and filling during diastole, a healthy blood \npressure is around 80\n mmHg\n. Measuring blood pressure is used as an indicator of  the health of  both \nyour heart and your blood vessels. Y our blood pressure goes up and down naturally during the day \u2013 but it shouldn\u2019t be constantly raised. If  your blood pressure is regularly above 140\/90\n mmHg\n, you \nhave high blood pressure or hypertension. Raised blood pressure can be a sign of  atherosclerosis. The blood pressure goes up when the walls of  the arteries become less flexible due to the build-up of  plaque, and when the lumen of  the arteries get narrower as they are blocked by the plaques. This means that raised blood pressure can be the result of  atherosclerosis and can be used to help diagnose the disease.\n\u25b2 fig C  Doctors can use a blood pr essure monitor like this to check that your blood pressure is in the healthy range. \nSome people buy and use their own monitor, so they can check their blood pressure regularly to help prevent them \ngetting CVDs.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Why do they do this? \nPREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE \nCardiovascular disease has a negative effect on individuals, on families  and on society. It costs a lot of  money to treat people in hospital. When  people are too ill to work, they are losing money for their families, and  also for the companies where they work. Treating people with drugs to  prevent them from needing surgery is cheaper for health service providers.  It is even cheaper (and better for the individual) if  we can stop ourselves  needing the drugs. So, prevention is better than treatment for CVDs for  many reasons (see fig A). However, persuading people to change their  \nlifestyle habits is often difficult.\nFor example, there is a lot of  reliable evidence to show that smoking is  \none of  the highest risk factors for CVDs. However, if  you stop smoking,  your risk of  developing heart disease is almost halved after just one year.  Moreover, research carried out by a team led by Azra Mahmud from  Trinity College Dublin and published in 2007 suggests that after 10 years,  the arteries of  smokers who stop smoking are the same as if  they had  never smoked. There is a lot of  support available for people who want to  stop smoking. Y et, despite all this, almost 1 billion people around the  world smoke cigarettes and millions of  them die each year of  CVDs and  cancers linked to their smoking. \nHealth education programmes in schools and communities can help to  \nmake sure that everyone is aware of  the risks associated with different  lifestyle choices. However, each individual has to make their own choices  and take their own risks.\nOVERWEIGHT OR UNDERFIT?\nMost people are aware that obesity is linked to CVDs, and many go on  slimming diets to try to lose weight. Most people also know that taking  regular exercise helps protect against CVDs \u2013 but more people choose to  go on a diet than choose to take regular exercise. The results of  a study  carried out over an average of  eight years on 20\n 000 men a\nged from  \n30 to 83 years are given in Section 1C.4 fig\u00a0B. Fitness was defined by  how much oxygen they used during exercise. The results show that if  you  are obese and fit you have a lower risk of  dying from CVDs than someone  who is not obese but unfit. Obviously, being the correct weight and fit is  best of  all! \nThe problem is that many people enjoy their food, and don\u2019t take sufficient exercise. It takes a lot of  \neffort to cut down the amount of  food you eat and change to eating healthier foods including lots of  fruit and vegetables. \u25b2\n fig A  Infogr aphics like this one published in Gulf News help \npeople understand the factors which affect their heart health.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember to read all the \ninformation in graphics.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Changing lifestyle, such as improving diet, giving up smoking and taking more exercise can help but there are also various drugs that can be given. The drugs aim to reduce the risks associated with CVDs by helping to prevent problems developing. However, all medicines carry some risk. \nCONTROLLING BLOOD PRESSURE\nAs you have seen, hypertension or high blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.\nANTIHYPERTENSIVES\nDrugs that reduce blood pressure are known as antihypertensives. Some commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs are described below.\n \u2022T\nreatment often begins with diuretics, which increase the volume \nof  urine produced. This eliminates excess fluids and salts, so that the blood volume decreases. With less blood, a smaller volume is pumped from the heart and the blood pressure falls. \n \u2022Beta b\nlockers interfere with the normal system for controlling \nthe heart. They block the response of  the heart to hormones such as adrenaline, which normally act to speed up the heart and increase the blood pressure (you will find out more in Book 2 Topic 7). So, beta blockers make the heart rate slower and the contractions less strong, so the blood pressure is lower.\nSympathetic nerve inhibitors affect the sympathetic nerves which go from your central nervous system to all parts of  your body (you will find out more in Book 2 Topic 7). Sympathetic nerves stimulate your arteries to constrict, which raises your blood pressure. The inhibitors prevent these nerves signalling to the arteries, which helps to keep the arteries dilated and your blood pressure lower.\n \u2022Angiotensin is a hor\nmone which stimulates the constriction of  \nyour blood vessels and so causes the blood pressure to rise. ACE inhibitors block the production of  angiotensin, which reduces the constriction of  your blood vessels and so keeps your blood pressure lower.\nThe benefits of  these drugs in reducing blood pressure are clear. They reduce the risk of  CVDs, and also reduce the risk of  damage to the kidneys and eyes from the high blood pressure. \nBut there are risks. The risks of  these treatments are twofold. \nIf  the treatment is not monitored carefully, your blood pressure may become too low. That can lead to falls and injuries which, particularly in elderly patients, can be serious and even life-threatening. The second major risk is the side-effects that may result from the way your body reacts to the drugs. Each type of  drug has its own possible side-effects (see fig A). For a drug to be given a licence for use, the benefits of  the treatment must be judged to outweigh any side-effects.\nThe side-effects from commonly used antihypertensives include \ncoughs, swelling of  the ankles, impotence, tiredness and fatigue, and constipation. These are not serious compared with the health risks from high blood pressure \u2013 but to the patient they may feel very significant. High blood pressure often doesn\u2019t make you feel ill, but the medication needed to control it can affect your quality of  life. Doctors find many patients stop taking their medication \u2013 the side-effects make them ignore the much larger but invisible risk of  CVDs.\n\u25b2 fig A  All medically licensed drugs c ome with instructions and information \nwhich includes possible side-effects known to be caused by the drug.\nEXAM HINT\nIf you are asked to discuss or evaluate the use of medication or some \nother treatment, you must remember to include both the benefits and the potential risks associated with the treatment.\nSTATINS\nStatins are a group of  drugs that lower the level of  cholesterol in \nyour blood. They block the enzyme in the liver that is responsible for making cholesterol, and are very effective at blocking the production of  LDLs. Statins also improve the balance of  LDLs to HDLs and reduce inflammation in the lining of  the arteries. Both functions reduce the risk of  atherosclerosis developing.\nFig B shows the results from a trial using statins with a group of  6605 \nAsian Indians in the US. This shows the results for men and women, and other groups who are high-risk categories for cardiovascular disease. Statins reduce the incidence of  serious cardiovascular disease in all categories, but they seem to have a greater effect for some groups than for others.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Statins had a strong positive \nbenefit to a range of patients.\nA UK study showed that men who took a particular statin for five \nyears had a lower risk of  death or heart attack, even 10 years after they stopped taking the drug. The study involved 6595 middle-aged men. It showed that for the first five years, the overall risk of  heart attack or death from any type of  heart disease was 11.8% for the men who took the statin, compared with 15.5% for men who took a placebo (an inactive substance that resembles the drug but has no action in the body). The risk was reduced the most while the men were taking the drug, but some level of  protection lasted for up to 10 years afterwards.\nMost people use statins with little or no ill effect. Side-effects of  \nmuscle and joint aches and nausea, constipation and diarrhoea are sometimes reported. However, there are two serious but very rare side-effects. In a tiny number of  people, statins trigger a form of  muscle inflammation which can be fatal. For example, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported 3339 cases of  these muscle reactions between January 1990 and March 2002, but during this time millions of  Americans took statins daily. Statins can also cause liver problems in a small group. As an example, the risk of  liver damage in people taking lovastatin is two in a million. Out of  51\n 741 li\nver transplant patients in the US \nbetween 1990 and 2002, liver failure appeared to be caused by statins in only three cases.\nAnother risk is more subtle: there is a risk that, if  people take \nstatins to lower their blood cholesterol, they will no longer try to eat a healthy diet, and statins give no protection against the other ill effects of  a bad diet.\nPlant stanols and sterols are now widely sold in spreads \nand yoghurts. These compounds are very similar in structure to cholesterol. They reduce the amount of  cholesterol absorbed from your gut into your blood, which can make it easier for your body to metabolise cholesterol and reduce the levels of  LDLs in the blood. Products like these are sold as a food, not as a drug. While there is scientific evidence that they are effective in many people, they have not undergone the levels of  testing that drugs such as statins have. Metadata analysis has shown that these products do work if  they are eaten regularly in the recommended amounts (2\n g \nper da\ny of  plant sterols and stanols). It has been estimated that \nthese products can lower your risk of  heart disease by about 25% if  they are used correctly (see fig C).Plant sterols (g\/d)LDL cholesterol (% change)0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5\n41 trials with plant sterols\/stanols:\n95% Cl from meta-analysisKatan et al.

Here are two examples.\nWarfarin is an anticoagulant that interferes with the \nmanufacture of  prothrombin in the body. Low prothrombin levels make the blood clot less easily (see Section 1B.2). Warfarin has been used in rat poison \u2013 in high doses the blood will not clot at all and the rats bleed to death after the slightest injury. In humans, the dose is carefully monitored to make sure that the clotting of  the blood is reduced but not prevented completely. \nPlatelet inhibitory drugs make the platelets less sticky, and \nso reduce the clotting ability of  the blood. The cheapest and most common of  these is aspirin (fig D) but clopidogrel is also commonly used. \n\u25b2 fig D  Aspirin is a r elatively cheap drug. It has been used traditionally  \nas a painkiller. It is also a very effective way of preventing many \ncardiovascular problems.\nThe risks of  taking aspirin are well known \u2013 it irritates the \nstomach lining and causes bleeding in the stomach which can become serious. A combination of  aspirin and clopidogrel can reduce the risk of  developing a range of  cardiovascular diseases by 20\u201325% in some low-risk patients. However, based on data from several studies it appears that, for some patients, the risk of  side-effects is much higher when the two drugs are combined. For example, for every 1000 patients at high risk of  CVDs treated for 28 months, five cardiovascular events would be avoided \u2013 but three major stomach bleeds would be caused. In lower-risk patients, 23 cardiovascular events would be avoided while 10 major bleeds would be caused. It is difficult to achieve the correct balance between preventing the blood from clotting too easily while allowing it to clot when necessary. For example, when people are treated with anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin, they must be monitored very carefully to make sure that they do not bleed internally, particularly in the brain. The decision whether to give warfarin will depend on many factors, including the patient\u2019s age and condition as well as other medication they may be taking.\nCHECKPOINT \n1.

Well now it's time to delve a little deeper...Membranes Control What Passes Through ThemAll cells are surrounded by membranes. In eukaryotic cells,many of the organelles are surrounded by membranes too.1)2)Cell-surface membranes surround cells. They are a barrier between the cell and its environment, controlling which substances enter and leave the cell. They're partially permeable \u2014 they let some molecules through but not others. Substances can move across the cell-surface membrane by diffusion, osmosis or active transport (see pages 38-43).The membranes around organelles divide the cell into different compartments \u2014 they act as a barrier between the organelle and the cytoplasm. They are also partially permeable and control what substances enter and leave the organelle.Cell Membranes have a Fluid Mosaic\u2019 StructurePartially permeable membranes can be useful at sea.The basic structure of all cell membranes is pretty much the same. They're composed of lipids (mainly phospholipids \u2014 see page 7), proteins and carbohydrates (attached to proteins or lipids).1)2)3)4)5)In 1972, the fluid mosaic model was suggested to describe the arrangement of molecules in the membrane.

They bind to the cholesterolhydrophobic tails of the phospholipids, causing them to pack more closely together.This restricts the movement of the phospholipids, making the membrane less fluid and more rigid.Cholesterol helps to maintain the shape of animal cells (which don't have cell walls). This is particularly important for cells that aren't supported by other cells, e.g. red blood cells, which float free in the blood.Topic 2B \u2014 Cell Membranes\n","15":"37Cell Membrane StructureThe Permeability of the Cell Membrane can be Investigated in the LabThe permeability of cell membranes is affected by different conditions, e.g. temperature and solvent concentration. You can investigate how these things affect permeability by doing an experiment using beetroot. Beetroot cells contain a coloured pigment that leaks out \u2014 the higher the permeability of the membrane, the more pigment leaks out of the cell. Here's how you could investigate how temperature affects beetroot membrane permeability:1) Use a scalpel to carefully cut five equal sized pieces of beetroot. (Make sure you do your cutting on a cutting board.) Rinse the pieces to remove any pigment released during cutting.2) Add the five pieces to five different test tubes, each containing 5 cm3 of water.Use a measuring cylinder or pipette to measure the water.3) Place each test tube in a water bath at a different temperature, e.g. 10 \u00b0C, 20 \u00b0C, 30 40 \u00b0C, 50 \u00b0C, for the same length of time (measured using a stopwatch).4) Remove the pieces of beetroot from the tubes, leaving just the coloured liquid.5) Now you need to use a colorimeter \u2014 a machine that passes light through the liquid and measures how much of that light is absorbed.

They're also non-polar, which makes them soluble in lipids, so they can dissolve in the hydrophobic bilayer.6) When molecules diffuse directly through a cell membrane, it's also known as simple diffusion.Facilitated Diffusion uses Carrier Proteins and Protein Channels1) Some larger molecules (e.g. amino acids, glucose) would diffuse extremely slowly through the phospholipid bilayer because they're so big.2) Charged particles, e.g. ions and polar molecules, would also diffuse slowly \u2014 that'sbecause they're water soluble, and the centre of the bilayer is hydrophobic (see page 36).3) So to speed things up, large or charged particles diffuse through carrier proteins or channel proteins in the membrane instead \u2014 this is called facilitated diffusion.4) Like diffusion, facilitated diffusion moves particles down a concentration gradient, from a higher to a lower concentration.5) It's also a passive process \u2014 it doesn't use energy.'fiAndy needed all his concentration for this particular gradient...Carrier proteins move large molecules across membranes, down their concentration gradient.

So, for those of you feeling a bit more active, here's a page all about... you guessed it... active transport.Active Transport Needs EnergyActive transport uses energy to move molecules and ions across membranes, usually against a concentration gradient.Carrier proteins are involved in active transport. The process is pretty similar to facilitated diffusion (see p. 38) \u2014 a molecule attaches to the carrier protein, the protein changes shape and this moves the molecule across the membrane, releasing it on the other side.There are two main differences between active transport and facilitated diffusion though:1) Active transport usually moves solutes from a low to a high concentration\u2014 in facilitated diffusion, they always move from a high to a low concentration.2) Active transport requires energy \u2014 facilitated diffusion does not.\u2022 ATP is a common source of energy in the cell.

Infectious diseases can be really nasty, but luckily there's an army of cells in the body that helps lo protect us \u2014 the immune system.Foreign Antigens Trigger an Immune ResponseAntigens are molecules (usually proteins) that can generate an immune response when clctected by the body.They arc usually found on the surface of cells and are used by the immune system to identify: pathogens (organisms that cause disease), abnormal body cells (e.g. cancerous or pathogen-infected cells, which have abnormal antigens on their surface), toxins and cells from other individuals of the same species (e.g. organ transplants).There are four main stages in the immune response:(T) Phagocytes Engulf PathogensA phagocyte (e.g. a macrophage) is a type of white blood cell that carries out phagocytosis (engulfment of pathogens). They're found in the blood and in tissues and are the first cells to respond to an immune system trigger inside the body. Here's how they work:1) A phagocyte recognises the foreign antigens on a pathogen.2) The cytoplasm of the phagocyte moves round the pathogen, engulfing it.3) The pathogen is now contained in a phagocytic vacuole (a bubble) in the cytoplasm of the phagocyte.4) A lysosome (an organelle that contain enzymes called lysozymes) fuses with the phagocytic vacuole. The lysozymes break down the pathogen.5) The phagocyte then presents the pathogen's antigens \u2014 it sticks the antigens on its surface to activate other immune system cells.nucleuscytoplasmlysosomeantigens on surface ofphagocyte engulfs the pathogenlysosome fuses with phagocytic vacuole(2) Phagocytes Activate T-cellsA T-cell {also called a T-lymphocyte) is another type of white blood cell. It has receptor proteins on its surface that bind to complementary antigens presented to it by phagocytes. This activates the T-cell. Different types of T-cells respond in different ways. For example, helper T-cells {TH cells) release chemical signals that activate and stimulate phagocytes and cytotoxic T-cells (Tc cells), which kill abnormal and foreign cells B-cells, which secrete antibodies (see below).Th cells also activate(3) T-cells Activate B-cells, Which Divide into Plasma CellsB-cells (also called B-lymphocytes) are also a type of white blood cell. They're covered with antibodies \u2014 proteins that bind antigens to form an antigen-antibody complex. Each B-cell has a different shaped antibody on its membrane, so different ones bind to different shaped antigens.1) When the antibody on the surface of a B-cell meets a complementary shaped antigen, it binds to it.2) This, together with substances released from helper T-cells, activates the B-cell. This process is called clonal selection.3) The activated B-cell divides into plasma cells.(V) Plasma Cells Make More Antibodies to a Specific AntigenPlasma cells are identical to the B-cell (they're clones). They secrete loads of antibodies specific to the antigen. These are called monoclonal antibodies. They bind to the antigens on the surface of the pathogen to form lots of antigen-antibody complexes,An antibody has two binding sites, so can bind to two pathogens at the same time. This means that pathogens become clumped together \u2014 this is called agglutination. Phagocytes then bind to the antibodies and phagocytose many pathogens at once. This process leads to the destruction of pathogens carrying this antigen in the body.variableregions(orange)constan regions (blue)heavychainAntibodies are proteins \u2014 they're made up of chains of amino acids.The specificity of an antibody depends on its variable regions, which form the antigen binding sites. Each antibody has a variable region with a unique tertiary structure {due to different amino acid sequences) that's complementary to one specific antigen. All antibodies have the same constant regions.Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","21":"46Immunity and VaccinesThe primary response gives us immunity against a disease, but only after you've become infected. If only there was a way to stimulate memory cell production without getting the disease... well, there is \u2014 vaccination.Vaccines can Protect Individuals and Populations Against Disease1) While your B-cells are busy dividing to build up their numbers to deal with a pathogen (i.e. the primary response \u2014 see previous page), you suffer from the disease. Vaccination can help avoid this.2) Vaccines contain antigens that cause your body to produce memory cells against a particular pathogen, without the pathogen causing disease. This means you become immune without getting any symptoms.3) Vaccines protect individuals that have them and, because they reduce the occurrence of the disease, those not vaccinated are also less likely to catch the disease (because there are fewer people to catch it from). This is called herd immunity.4) Vaccines always contain antigens \u2014 these may be free or attached to a dead or attenuated (weakened) pathogen.5) Vaccines may be injected or taken orally. The disadvantages of taking a vaccine orally are that it could be broken down by enzymes in the gut or the molecules of the vaccine may be too large to be absorbed into the blood.6) Sometimes booster vaccines are given later on (e.g. after several years) to make sure that memory cells are produced.Antigenic Variation Helps Some Pathogens Evade the Immune System1) Antigens on the surface of pathogens activate the primary response.2) When you're infected a second time with the same pathogen (which has the same antigens on its surface) they activate the secondary response and you don't get ill.3) However, some sneaky pathogens can change their surface antigens. This antigen variability is called antigenic variation. (Different antigens are formed due to changes in the genes of a pathogen.)4) This means that when you're infected for a second time, the memory cells produced from the first infection will not recognise the different antigens. So the immune system has to start from scratch and carry out a primary response against these new antigens.5) This primary response takes time to get rid of the infection, which is why you get ill again.6) Antigenic variation also makes it difficult to develop vaccines against some pathogens for the same reason. Examples of pathogens that show antigenic variation include HIV and the influenza virus.7) Here's how antigenic variation affects the production of vaccines to help prevent people catching influenza:1) The influenza (flu) vaccine changes every year. That's because the antigens on the surface of the influenza virus change regularly, forming new strains of the virus.2) Memory cells produced from vaccination with one strain of the flu will not recognise other strains with different antigens. The strains are immunologically distinct.3) Every year there are different strains of the influenza virus circulating in the population, so a different vaccine has to be made.4) New vaccines are developed and one is chosen every year that is the most effective against the recently circulating influenza viruses.5) Governments and health authorities then implement a programme of vaccination using the most suitable vaccine.1st infection\n2nd infectiondifferent antigensThe oral vaccine was proving hard to swallow.\nTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","22":"4CarbohydratesSo, you've already looked at monosaccharides and disaccharides... now it's time to give polysaccharides some love.Polysaccharides are Loads of Sugars Joined TogetherA polysaccharide is formed when more than two monosaccharides are joined together by condensation reactions.\na-glucose a-glucose a-glucose a-glucose a-glucoseYou need to know about the relationship between the structure and function of three polysaccharides\u2014 starch, glycogen and cellulose.Starch is the Main Energy Storage Material in Plants\none alpha-glucose molecule1) Cells get energy from glucose. Plants store excess glucose as starch (when a plant needs more glucose for energy, it breaks down starch to release the glucose).2) Starch is a mixture of two polysaccharides of alpha-glucose \u2014 amylose and amylopectin:\u2022 Amylose \u2014 a long, unbranched chain of a-glucose. The angles of the glycosidic bonds give it a coiled structure, almost like a cylinder. This makes it compact, so it's really good for storage because you can fit more in to a small space.\u2022 Amylopectin \u2014 a long, branched chain of a-glucose. Its side branches allow the enzymes that break down the molecule to get at the glycosidic bonds easily.This means that the glucose can be released quickly. Amylopectin3) Starch is insoluble in water and doesn't affect water potential (see page 40), so it doesn't cause water to enter cells by osmosis, which would make them swell.This makes it good for storage.Use the Iodine Test for StarchIf you do any experiment on the digestion of starch and want to find out if any is left, you'll need the iodine test.just add iodine dissolved in potassium iodide solution to the test sample. If there is starch present, the sample changes from browny-orange to a dark, blue-black colour.Glycogen is the Main Energy Storage Material in AnimalsGlycogen1) Animal cells get energy from glucose too.But animals store excess glucose as glycogen\u2014 another polysaccharide of alpha-glucose.2) Its structure is very similar to amylopectin, except that it has loads more side branches coming off it. Loads of branches means that stored glucose can be released quickly, which is important for energy release in animals.3) It's also a very compact molecule, so it's good for storage.After throwing and fetching the ball no less than 312 times, Chappy and Stuart were finally out of glycogen.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","23":"48Antibodies in MedicineAntibodies aren't only great for fighting off infection, they're also excellent tools for use in medical diagnosis and drug development. Let's all give three cheers for antibodies. Without them, we'd all probably be dead by now.Monoclonal Antibodies can be used to Target Specific Substances or Cells1) Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies produced from a single group of genetically identical B-cells(plasma cells). This means that they're all identical in structure.2) As you know, antibodies are very specific because their binding sites have a unique tertiary structure (see p.44) that only one particular antigen will fit into (one with a complementary shape).3) You can make monoclonal antibodies that bind to anything you want, e.g. a cell antigen or other substance, and they will only bind to (target) this molecule.EXAMPLE: Targeting drugs to a particular cell type \u2014 cancer cells1) Different cells in the body have different surface antigens.2) Cancer cells have antigens called tumour markers that are not found on normal body cells.3) Monoclonal antibodies can be made that will bind to the tumour markers.4) You can also attach anti-cancer drugs to the antibodies.5) When the antibodies come into contact with the canccr cells they will bind to the tumour markers.6) This means the drug will only accumulate in the body where there are cancer cells.7) So, the side effects of an antibody-based drug are lower than other drugs because they accumulate near specific cells.monoclonalantibodyantigen binding siteanti-cancer drugdrug attached to antibodyantibody binds to tumour markers on cancer cellcell-surface antigen\/\\----------------------------No0No------------------------------------------------------------\u2014L\nnormal body cell tumour marker cancer cellEXAMPLE: Targeting a particular substance for medical diagnosis \u2014 pregnancy testingPregnancy tests detect the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) that's found in the urine of pregnant women:1) The application area contains antibodies for hCG bound to a coloured bead (blue).2) When urine is applied to the application area any hCG will bind to the antibody on the beads, forming an antigen-antibody complex.3) The urine moves up the stick to the test strip, carrying any beads with it.4) The test strip contains antibodies to hCG that are stuck in place (immobilised).5) If there is hCG present the test strip turns blue because the immobilised antibody binds to any hCG \u2014 concentrating the hCG-antibody complex with the blue beads attached.If no hCG is present, the beads will pass through the test area without binding to anything, and so it won't go blue.coloured bead antibody \u00a9 ^ to hCGhCG\nappflow of liquidIimmobilised antibody to hCGication areatest stripTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","24":"52HIV and VirusesViruses aren't cells like bacteria. They're not even living things \u2014 they can only reproduce inside the cells of another organism (called the host). All viruses cause disease, and you need to know all about one particularly nasty blighter...HIV is the Virus That Causes AIDS1) HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that affects the immune system.It eventually leads to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).2) AIDS is a condition where the immune system deteriorates and eventually fails. This makes someone with AIDS more vulnerable to other infections, like pneumonia (see next page).3) HIV infects (and eventually kills) helperT-cells, which act as the host cells (see p. 28) for the virus. Remember, helper T-cells send chemical signals that activate phagocytes, cytotoxic T-cells and B-cells (see p. 44) so they're hugely important cells in the immune response. Without enough helper T-cells, the immune system is unable to mount an effective response to infections because other immune system cells don't behave how they should.4) People infected with HIV develop AIDS when the helper T-cell numbers in their body reach a critically low level.HIV has a Spherical StructureYou might get asked about the structure of HIV in your exam1) A core that contains the genetic material (RNA) and some proteins (including the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is needed for virus replication).2) An outer coating of protein called a capsid.3) An extra outer layer called an envelope. This is made of membrane stolen from the cell membrane of a previous host cell.4) Sticking out from the envelope are loads of copies of an attachment protein that help HIV attach to thehost helper T-cell.HIV Replicates Inside its Host\u2019s Helper T-CellsHIV (and all other viruses) can only reproduce inside the cells of the organism it has infected. HIV replicates inside the helper T-cells of the host. It doesn't have the equipment (such as enzymes and ribosomes) to replicate on its own, so it uses those of the host cell.Here's how HIV replicates:1) The attachment protein attaches to a receptor molecule on the cell membrane of the host helper T-cell.2) The capsid is released into the cell, where it uncoats and releases the genetic material (RNA) into the cell's cytoplasm.3) Inside the cell, reverse transcriptase is used to make a complementary strand of DNA from the viral RNA template (see p. 16-17 for more on DNA and RNA).4) From this, double-stranded DNA is made and inserted into the human DNA.5) Host cell enzymes are used to make viral proteins from theviral DNA found within the human DNA.6) The viral proteins are assembled into new viruses, which bud from the cell and go on to infect other cells.During the initial infection period, HIV replicates rapidly and the infected person may experience severe flu-likesymptoms. After this period, HIV replication drops to a lower level. This is the latency period. During the latency period (which can last for years), the infected person won't experience any symptoms.Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\u00a9HIVhelper T cellDNA\u00a9\u00aev \u201c \u201c  DAttachment protein CapsidS1 , \" \"........................u-n,,,,,._ ttachnient proteins can also -EnvelopeGeneticmaterialReverse transcriptase\n","25":"54Topic 3A \u2014 Exchange and Transport SystemsSize and Surface AreaExchanging things with the environment is pretty easy if you're a single-celled organism, but if you're multicellular it all gets a bit more complicated... and it's all down to this 'surface area to volume ratio' malarkey.Organisms Need to Exchange Substances with their EnvironmentEvery organism, whatever its size, needs to exchange things with its environment.Otherwise there'd be no such thing as poop scoops...1) Cells need to take in oxygen (for aerobic respiration) and nutrients.2) They also need to excrete waste products like carbon dioxide and urea.3) Most organisms need to stay at roughly the same temperature, Raj was g|ac| he'd exchangedSO heat needs to be exchanged too. his canoe for a bigger boat.How easy the exchange of substances is depends on the organism's surface area to volume ratio.Smaller Animals have Higher Surface Area : Volume RatiosA mouse has a bigger surface area relative to its volume than a hippo.

The diffusion rate is quick because of the small distances the substances have to travel (see p. 39).2) In multicellular animals, diffusion across the outer membrane is too slow, for two reasons:\u2022 Some cells are deep within the body \u2014 there's a big distance between them and the outside environment.\u2022 Larger animals have a low surface area to volume ratio \u2014 it's difficult to exchange enough substances to supply a large volume of animal through a relatively small outer surface.So rather than using straightforward diffusion to absorb and excrete substances, multicellular animals need specialised exchange organs (like lungs \u2014 see p. 58).They also need an efficient system to carry substances to and from their individual cells \u2014 this is mass transport.In mammals, 'mass transport' normally refers to the circulatory system (see p. 70), which uses blood to carry glucose and oxygen around the body. It also carries hormones, antibodies (p. 44) and waste like CO,.Mass transport in plants involves the transport of water and solutes in the xylem and phloem (see pages 78 and 80).Topic 3 A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","26":"56Gas ExchangeLots of organisms have developed adaptations to improve their rate of gas exchange. It's a tricky business if you're an insect or a plant though \u2014 you've got to exchange enough gas but avoid losing all your water and drying to a crisp...Gas Exchange Surfaces have Two Major AdaptationsMost gas exchange surfaces have two things in common:1) They have a large surface area.2) They're thin (often just one layer of epithelial cells)\u2014 this provides a short diffusion pathway across the gas exchange surfaceThe organism also maintains a steep concentration gradient of gases across the exchange surface.All these features increase the rate of diffusion \u2014see page 39.Single-celled Organisms Exchange Gases across their Body Surface1) Single-celled organisms absorb and release gases by diffusion through their outer surface.2) They have a relatively large surface area, a thin surface and a short diffusion pathway (oxygen can take part in biochemical reactions as soon as it diffuses into the cell)\u2014 so there's no need for a gas exchange system.Fish Use a Counter-Current System for Gas ExchangeThere's a lower concentration of oxygen in water than in air. So fish have special adaptations to get enough of it.1) Water, containing oxygen, enters the fish through its mouth and passes out through the gills.2) Each gill is made of lots of thin plates called gill filaments, which give a big surface area for exchange of gases.3) The gill filaments are covered in lots of tiny structures called artcry ___^ \/(plural = lamellae)lamellae, which increase the surface area even more.4) The lamellae have lots of blood capillaries and a thin surface layer of cells to speed up diffusion.artery (deoxygenated blood to gill)artery (oxygenated blood from the gill)lamella\nblood leaves lamella with high oxygen conc.Water flowing towards the lamella (relatively high oxygen conc.'blood enters lamella with low oxygen conc.Water flowing away from the lamella (relatively low oxygen conc.)gill filaments5) Blood flows through the lamellae in one direction and water flows over in the opposite direction. This is called a counter-current system. It maintains a large concentration gradient between the water and the blood.

This means that oxygen diffuses directly into the respiring cells \u2014 the insect's circulatory system doesn't transport Or5) Carbon dioxide from the cells moves down its own concentration gradient towards the spiracles to be released into the atmosphere.6) Insects use rhythmic abdominal movements to move air in and out of the spiraclesspiracletracheole lined with single layer of cells to minimise diffusion distanceOj diffuses into respiring cellsCO, diffuses into tracheal tubesTopic 3 A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","27":"58Gas Exchange in HumansIn humans, gas exchange takes place in the lungs. You need to know the structure of the lungs as well as how they're ventilated... take a deep breath...Lungs are Specialised Organs for Gas ExchangeHumans need to get oxygen into the blood (for respiration) and they need to get rid of carbon dioxide (made by respiring cells). This is where breathing (or ventilation as it's sometimes called) and the gas exchange system comes in.Human Gas Exchange Systemintercostal muscles bronchusbronchiole alveoli1) As you breathe in, air enters the trachea (windpipe).2) The trachea splits into two bronchi \u2014 one bronchus leading to each lung.3) Each bronchus then branches off into smaller tubes called bronchioles.4) The bronchioles end in small 'air sacs' called alveoli (this is where gases are exchanged \u2014 see next page).5) The ribcage, intercostal muscles and diaphragm all work together to move air in and out (see below).si 111 n 111 u i w 111 m i \\ \/111 u ii i u 111111111 11111 m i 11 w n 111111\/ ~ There are actually three layers of intercostal muscles.

This can make it more difficult to breathe and reduce the rate of gas exchange.Measures of Lung Function Can Help to Diagnose Lung DiseasesLung diseases affect both ventilation (breathing) and gas exchange in the lungs \u2014 in other words, how well the lungs function. Doctors can carry out tests to investigate lung function and diagnose a lung disease. You might be asked to interpret results from tests like these in your exams. Here are some terms you might come across:1) Tidal volume is the volume of air in each breath \u2014 usually between 0.4 dm* and 0.5 dm* for adults.2) Ventilation rate is the number of breaths per minute. For a healthy person at rest it's about 15 breaths.3) Forced expiratory volumet (FEV1) is the maximum volume of air that can be breathed out in 1 second.4) Forced vital capacity (FVC) is the maximum volume of air it is possible to sV\\n m u n m i m ibreathe forcefully out of the lungs after a really deep breath in. \u201c stan s \u00b0r. z0\/1 - decimetres cubed, -X 1 dm3 is the same -You can figure out tidal volume, ventilation rate and other measures of breathing from the graph produced from a spirometer (a fancy machine that scientists and doctors use to measure the volume of air breathed in and out):9. as a litre. :\nMeasuring tidal volume is one of the hardest jobs in the world.Different Diseases Affect the Lungs in Different WaysHere are some examples of different lung diseases and how they affect breathing.Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB)1) When someone becomes infected with tuberculosis bacteria, immune system cells build a wall around the bacteria in the lungs. This forms small, hard lumps known as tubercles.2) Infected tissue within the tubercles dies and the gaseous exchange surface is damaged, so tidal volume is decreased.3) Tuberculosis also causes fibrosis (see below), which further reduces the tidal volume.4) A reduced tidal volume means less air can be inhaled with each breath. In order to take in enough oxygen, patients have to breathe faster, i.e. ventilation rate is increased.5) Common symptoms include a persistent cough, coughing up blood and mucus, chest pains, shortness of breath and fatigue.Fibrosis1) Fibrosis is the formation of scar tissue in the lungs.This can be the result of an infection or exposure to substances like asbestos or dust.2) Scar tissue is thicker and less elastic than normal lung tissue.3) This means that the lungs are less able to expand and so can't hold as much air as normal \u2014 tidal volume is reduced, and so is FVC (i.e. a smaller volume of air can be forcefully breathed out).4) There's a reduction in the rate of gaseous exchange \u2014 diffusion is slower across a thicker scarred membrane.5) Symptoms of fibrosis include shortness of breath, a dry cough, chest pain, fatigue and weakness.6) Fibrosis sufferers have a faster ventilation rate than normal \u2014 to get enough air into their lungs to oxygenate their blood.Topic 3A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","29":"64Dissecting Gas Exchange SystemsAfter learning all about how different organisms are adapted for efficient gas exchange, you might be wondering what those structures really look like. Well, here are some lovely dissections that you might do. How exciting.You Need to be Able to Carry Out Dissections1) As part of your AS or A level in Biology, you're expected to carry out at least one dissection. It could be a dissection of a gaseous exchange system or a mass transport system (or an organ within one of those systems) in either an animal or a plant. You could also be asked about dissections in your exams.2) There's an example of a plant dissection that you could do on page 79.These two pages cover some animal dissections that you could do as well or instead.3) Whether it's a plant or animal dissection, you're expected to know how to carry it out safely and ethically.

They'll probably be sheep or pig lungs from a butcher's shop. You should be able to see the trachea and two bronchi going into the lungs.To see the lungs inflate, attach a piece of rubber tubing to the trachea and pump air into the lungs using a foot or bicycle pump. The lungs will deflate by themselves because of the elastin in the walls of the alveoli (see p. 61).Never blow down the tube to inflate the lungs \u2014 you could end up sucking up stale air from irside the lungs into your mouth.Pop the lungs in a clear plastic bag before you start to stop bacteria inside the lungs from being released into the room.Once you've seen the lungs inflate, you can examine the different tissue types in the lungs.The trachea is supported by C-shaped rings of cartilage. smooth muscleA cross-section of the trachea looks like this:C-shapedcartilageII I | I 1 \\ I I I M I III I I ' I M 1\/- If you do cut the - Z. cartilage be careful \u2014 you -- need to wear goggles to rprotect your eyes.\/| i \\ i H n 111 w M 111 M i7)8) 9)Cartilage is tough, so if you want to open up the trachea, it's best to cut it lengthways, down the gap in the C-shaped rings.

You should be able to see the bronchioles branching off.Cut off a piece of the lung. The tissue will feel spongy because of the air trapped in all the alveoli.Lungs from a butcher are safe for humans to handle, but they could still contain bacteria that cause food poisoning. That's why it's important to wash your hands after the dissection and disinfect work surfaces.Here\u2019s How to Dissect Fish Gills in Bony Fish1) Again, make sure you're wearing an apron or lab coat.2) Place your chosen fish (something like a perch or salmon works well) in a dissection tray or on a cutting board.3) Gills are located on either side of the fish's head. They're protected on eachside by a bony flap called an operculum and supported by gill arches.4) To remove the gills, push back the operculum and use scissors to carefully remove the gills.

As you might imagine, this involves loads of different chemical reactions and our old friends, enzymes.Food is Broken Down into Smaller Molecules During Digestion1) The large biological molecules (e.g. starch, proteins) in food are too big to cross cell membranes.This means they can't be absorbed from the gut into the blood.2) During digestion, these large molecules are broken down into smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, amino acids), which can move across cell membranes. This means they can be easily absorbed from the gut into the blood, to be transported around the body for use by the body cells.3) You might remember from Topic 1 A, that most large biological molecules are polymers, which can be broken down into smaller molecules (monomers) using hydrolysis reactions.Hydrolysis reactions break bonds by adding water.4) During hydrolysis, carbohydrates are broken down into disaccharides and then monosaccharides.Fats are broken down into fatty acids and monoglycerides. Proteins are broken down into amino acids.Digestive Enzymes are Used to Break Down Biological Molecules in Food1) A variety of different digestive enzymes are produced by specialised cells in the digestive systems of mammals. These enzymes are then released into the gut to mix with food.2) Since enzymes only work with specific substrates (see page 11), different enzymes are needed to catalyse the breakdown of different food molecules.Carbohydrates are Broken Down by Amylase and Membrane-Bound Disaccharidases1) Amylase is a digestive enzyme that catalyses the conversion of starch (a polysaccharide) into the smaller sugar maltose (a disaccharide). This involves the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds in starch.2) Amylase is produced by the salivary glands (which release amylase into the mouth) and also by the pancreas (which releases amylase into the small intestine).3) Membrane-bound disaccharidases are enzymes that are attached to the cell membranes of epithelial cellslining the ileum (the final part of the small intestine). They help to break down disaccharides (e.g. maltose, sucrose and lactose) into monosaccharides (e.g. glucose, fructose and galactose).

This involves the hydrolysis of the ester bonds in lipids.2) Lipases are made in the pancreas. They work in the small intestine.3) Bile salts are produced by the liver and emulsify lipids \u2014 this means they cause the lipids to form small droplets.4) Bile salts are really important in the process of lipid digestion. Several small lipid droplets have a bigger surface area than a single large droplet (for the same volume of lipid).

As well as being found in all vertebrates, haemoglobin is found in earthworms, starfish, some insects, some plants and even in some bacteria.Haemoglobin Saturation Depends on the Partial Pressure of Oxygen1) The partial pressure of oxygen (p02) is a measure of oxygen concentration.The greater the concentration of dissolved oxygen in cells, the higher the partial pressure.2) Similarly, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pC02) is a measure of the concentration of CO, in a cell.3) Haemoglobin's affinity for oxygen varies depending on the partial pressure of oxygen:Oxygen loads onto haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin where there's a hi;Oxyhaemoglobin unloads its oxygen where there's a lower p02.4) Oxygen enters blood capillaries at the alveoli in the lungs. Alveoli have a high p02 so oxygen loads onto haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin.5) When cells respire, they use up oxygen \u2014 this lowers the pOr Red blood cells deliver oxyhaemoglobin to respiring tissues, where it unloads its oxygen6) The haemoglobin then returns to the lungs to pick up more oxygen.There was no use pretending \u2014 the partial pressure of CH., had just increased, and Keith knew who was to blame.Dissociation Curves Show How Affinity for Oxygen VariesA dissociation curve shows how saturated the haemoglobin is with oxygen at any given partial pressure.slll I I M M I III W I I I I I I II I \/\/,- 100% saturation means C- every haemoglobin molecule f~ is carrying the maximum -- of 4 molecules of oxygen. \u2014'\/1 I II I I M I II II M J 1 I II I I I IX\\U I I I II H I I I M I II M I I I M I l\/y- 0% saturation means none 3r of the haemoglobin molecules 5are carrying any oxygen. -\"'n I I M I i w I I I I II II 11 n I I 11The graph is 'S-shaped' because when haemoglobin (Hb) combines with the first 02 molecule, its shape alters in a way that makes it easier for other molecules to join too.

As a result, the curve has a steep bit in the middle where it's really easy for oxygen molecules to join, and shallow bits at each end where it's harder.

The right side only needs to get blood to the lungs, which are nearby.2) The ventricles have thicker walls than the atria, because they have to push blood out of the heart whereas the atria just need to push blood a short distance into the ventricles.3) The atrioventricular (AV) valves link the atria to the ventricles and stop blood flowing back into the atria when the ventricles contract.4) The semi-lunar (SL) valves link the ventricles to the pulmonary artery and aorta, and stop blood flowing back into the heart after the ventricles contract.5) The cords attach the atrioventricular valves to the ventricles to stop them being forced up into the atria when the ventricles contract.Captain Jeff reckoned the lock gates were just like a big heart valve \u2014 with enough pressure he would be able to force his way through.The valves only open one way \u2014 whether they're open or closed depends on the relative pressure of the heart chambers.If there's higher pressure behind a valve, it's forced open, but if pressure is higher in front of the valve it's forced shut.

There are certain factors that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.Most Cardiovascular Disease Starts with Atheroma Formationelastic tissue in wall1) The wall of an artery is made up of several layers (see p. 70).2) The endothelium (inner lining) is usually smooth and unbroken.3) If damage occurs to the endothelium (e.g. by high blood pressure) white blood cells (mostly macrophages) and lipids (fat) from the blood, clump together under the lining to form fatty streaks.4) Over time, more white blood cells, lipids and connective tissue build up and harden to form a fibrous plaque called an atheroma.5) This plaque partially blocks the lumen of the artery and restricts blood flow, which causes blood pressure to increase.6) Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a type of cardiovascular disease.It occurs when the coronary arteries have lots of atheromas in them, which restricts blood flow to the heart muscle. It can lead to myocardial infarction (see below).Atheromas Increase the Risk of Aneurysm and ThrombosisTwo types of disease that affect the arteries are:Aneurysm \u2014 a balloon-like swelling of the artery.1) Atheroma plaques damage and weaken arteries.They also narrow arteries, increasing blood pressure.2) When blood travels through a weakened artery at high pressure, it may push the inner layers of the artery through the outer elastic layer to form a balloon-like swelling \u2014 an aneurysm.3) This aneurysm may burst, causing a haemorrhage (bleeding).Thrombosis \u2014 formation of a blood clot.1) An atheroma plaque can rupture (burst through) the endothelium (inner lining) of an artery.2) This damages the artery wall and leaves a rough surface.3) Platelets and fibrin (a protein) accumulate at the site of damage and form a blood clot (a thrombus).4) This blood clot can cause a complete blockage of the artery, or it can become dislodged and block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body.5) Debris from the rupture can cause another blood clot to form further down the artery.Interrupted Blood Flow to the Heart can Cause a Myocardial Infarction1) The heart muscle is supplied with blood by the coronary arteries.2) This blood contains the oxygen needed by heart muscle cells to carry out respiration.3) If a coronary artery becomes completely blocked (e.g. by a blood clot) an area of the heart muscle will be totally cut off from its blood supply, receiving no oxygen.4) This causes a myocardial infarction \u2014 more commonly known as a heart attack.5) A heart attack can cause damage and death of the heart muscle.6) Symptoms include pain in the chest and upper body, shortness of breath and sweating.7) If large areas of the heart are affected complete heart failure can occur, which is often fatal.aneurysmnormal arterythick muscle* layerdeposits of fatty material, dead cells, white blood cells and connective tissuedeposits of fatty material etc. build up and push out endothelium to form an atheromalumen(space in centre)endothelium\nlumen shrinks as artery wall swells, so it's more difficult for blood to pass through\nTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n","37":"76Cardiovascular DiseaseSome Factors Increase the Risk of Cardiovascular DiseaseSome of the most common risk factors for cardiovascular disease are:High blood cholesterol and poor diet1) If the blood cholesterol level is high (above 240 mg per 100 cm3) then the risk of cardiovascular disease is increased.2) This is because cholesterol is one of the main constituents of the fatty deposits that form atheromas (see previous page).3) Atheromas can lead to increased blood pressure and blood clots.4) This could block the flow of blood to coronary arteries, which could cause a myocardial infarction (see previous page for details).5) A diet high in saturated fat is associated with high blood cholesterol levels.6) A diet high in salt also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease because it increases the risk of high blood pressure (see below).John decided to live on the edge and ordered a fry-up.G)Cigarette smoking1) Both nicotine and carbon monoxide, found in cigarette smoke, increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.2) Nicotine increases the risk of high blood pressure (see below).3) Carbon monoxide combines with haemoglobin and reduces the amount of oxygen transported in the blood, and so reduces the amount of oxygen available to tissues. If heart muscle doesn't receive enough oxygen it can lead to a heart attack(see previous page).4) Smoking also decreases the amount of antioxidants in the blood \u2014 these are important for protecting cells from damage. Fewer antioxidants means cell damage in the coronary artery walls is more likely, and this can lead to atheroma formation.High blood pressure1) High blood pressure increases the risk of damage to the artery walls.2) Damaged walls have an increased risk of atheroma formation, causing a further increase in blood pressure.3) Atheromas can also cause blood clots to form (see previous page).4) A blood clot could block flow of blood to the heart muscle, possibly resulting in myocardial infarction.5) So anything that increases blood pressure also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, e.g. being overweight, not exercising and excessive alcohol consumption.~ ^ther factors include age ' - (risk increases with age) ~ 5 and sex (men are more at E -v risk than women) - IW||VV\"Most of these factors are within our control \u2014 a person can choose to smoke, eat fatty foods, etc. However, some risk factors can't be controlled, such as having a genetic predisposition to coronary heart disease or having high blood pressure as a result of another condition, e.g. some forms of diabetes. Even so, the risk of developing cardiovascular disease can be reduced by removing as many risk factors as you possibly can.Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n","38":"78Transport in Plants \u2014 XylemTransport in plants isn't really roads and railways, but I guess it's a bit like a flowing river that's carrying stuff around in a network of tubes. When you consider the movement of water, it's all about the xylem. It's pretty exciting stuff...Two Types of Tissue are Involved in Transport in Plants1) Xylem tissue transports water and mineral ions in solution.These substances move up the plant from the roots to the leaves.2) Phloem tissue transports organic substances like sugars (also in solution) bothup and down the plant \u2014 there's more about the phloem on pages 80-81.3) Xylem and phloem are mass transport systems (see page 54) \u2014 they move substances over large distances.Xylem vessels are the part of the xylem tissue that actually transports the water and ions. Xylem vessels are very long, tube-like structures formed from dead cells (vessel elements) joined end to end. There are no end walls on these cells, making an uninterrupted tube that allows water to pass up through the middle easily.Xvlem Vesselcell \u00a3wallno end wallc between cells\u00bbtube that water moves throughWater Moves Up a Plant Against the Force of GravityCohesion and tension help water move up plants, from roots to leaves, against the force of gravity.1) Water evaporates from the leaves at the 'top' of the xylem (this is transpiration \u2014 see below).2) This creates tension (suction), which pulls more water into the leaf.3) Water molecules are cohesive (they stick together \u2014 see page 21)so when some are pulled into the leaf others follow. 111 n n 11 u n \/\/,This means the whole column of water in the xylem, \u00a3 \u201d^'s is calle<^ -from the leaves down to the roots, moves upwards. - c\u00b0 esion'tensiori -\u2014 theory of water -4) Water enters the stem through the roots. ~ transport. -n i1 ii 111 niii\\sTranspiration is Loss of Water from a Plant\u2019s SurfaceTranspiration is the evaporation of water from a plant's surface, especially the leaves.1) Water evaporates from the moist cell walls and accumulates in the spaces between cells in the leaf.2) When the stomata open (see page 57), it moves out of the leaf down the concentration gradient (there's more water inside the leaf than in the air outside).s.\"'\"n\"\"i i n II I\/(I,,,,,r Transpiration's really a side \u00a3 r effect of photosynthesis \u2014 ~- the plant needs to open its \u00a7 r stomata to let in CO, so E ~ that it can produce glucose, -- but this also lets water out. z ' 111 11 \/1111111 \/ \/111 |, n\\sFour Main Factors Affect Transpiration Rate1) Light \u2014 the lighter it is the faster the transpiration rate (i.e. there's a positive correlationbetween light intensity and transpiration rate). This is because the stomata open when it gets light to let in CO, for photosynthesis. When it's dark the stomata are usually closed, so there's little transpiration.2) Temperature \u2014 the higher the temperature the faster the transpiration rate. Warmer water molecules have more energy so they evaporate from the cells inside the leaf faster. This increases the concentration gradient between the inside and outside of the leaf, making water diffuse out of the leaf faster.3) Humidity \u2014 the lower the humidity, the faster the transpiration rate (i.e. there's a negative correlationbetween humidity and transpiration rate). If the air around the plant is dry, the concentration gradient between the leaf and the air is increased, which increases transpiration.4) Wind \u2014 the windier it is, the faster the transpiration rate. Lots of air movement blows away water molecules from around the stomata. This increases the concentration gradient, which increases the rate of transpiration.water evaporatestension<3 cohesiong) water enters\nTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n","39":"80Transport in Plants \u2014 PhloemNext up, it's time to look at phloem. I know,; I almost can't contain my excitement. When it comes to the phloem it's all about moving dissolved organic substances around the plant, so it's a bit different to xylem.Phloem Tissue is Adapted for Transporting Solutes1) Solutes are dissolved substances. Phloem tissue transports solutes (mainly sugars like sucrose) round plants. Like xylem, phloem is formed from cells arranged in tubes.2) Sieve tube elements and companion cells are important cell types in phloem tissue:\u2022 Sieve tube elements are living cells that form the tube for transporting solutes. They have no nucleus and few organelles, so...\u2022 ...there's a companion cell for each sieve tube element. They carry out living functions for sieve cells, e.g. providing the energy needed for the active transport of solutes.Translocation is the Movement of Solutes1) Translocation is the movement of solutes (e.g. sugars like sucrose, and amino acids) to where they're needed in a plant. Solutes are sometimes called assimilates.2) It's an energy-requiring process that happens in the phloem.3) Translocation moves solutes from 'sources' to 'sinks'. The source of a solute is where it's made (so it's at a high concentration there). The sink is the area where it's used up (so it's at a lower concentration there).E.g. the source for sucrose is usually the leaves (where it's made), and the sinks are the other parts of the plant, especially the food storage organs and the meristems {areas of growth) in the roots, stems and leaves.4) Enzymes maintain a concentration gradient from the source to the sink by changing the solutes at the sink (e.g. by breaking them down or making them into something else). This makes sure there's always a lower concentration at the sink than at the source.E.g. in potatoes, sucrose is converted to starch in the sink areas, so there's always a lower concentration of sucrose at the sink than inside the phloem. This makes sure a constant supply of new sucrose reaches the sink from the phloem.The Mass Flow Hypothesis Best Explains Phloem TransportScientists still aren't certain exactly how the solutes are transported from source to sink by translocation. The best supported theory is the mass flow hypothesis:1) Active transport (see p. 42) is used to actively load the solutes (e.g. sucrose from photosynthesis) from companion cells into the sieve tubes of the phloem at the source (e.g. the leaves).2) This lowers the water potential inside the sieve tubes, so water enters the tubes by osmosis from the xylem and companion cells.3) This creates a high pressure inside the sieve tubes at the source end of the phloem.1) At the sink end, solutes are removed from the phloem to be used up.2) This increases the water potential inside the sieve tubes, so water also leaves the tubes by osmosis.3) This lowers the pressure inside the sieve tubes.(j) SOURCElow water potential, high pressurewater flow solute flow\u00a9sieve plate plasmodesma\u2014Water flows to xylem(2) SINK high water potential,\u00ae1) The result is a pressure gradient from the source end to the sink end.

Chromosomes are found in the nucleus.The DNA molecule is really long so, it has to be wound up so it can fit into the nucleus.The DNA molecule is wound around proteins called histones.Histone proteins also help to support the DNA.The DNA (and protein) is then coiled up very tightly to make a compact chromosome.DNA double-helixDNA Histone proteins A single chromosomeDNA wound around histone proteinsDNA with the protein is coiled up repeatedly= Eukary\u00b0t'c cells include - Z a\"'\u2122al and p|ant ce|)s r r \u201cr\u00b0karyotir cells are -My bacteria. =1111 111 111 i\\\\~6)The mitochondria and chloroplasts in eukaryotic cells also have their own DNA.

They both involve RNA.There\u2019s More Than One Type of RNARemember, RNA is a single polynucleotide strand and it contains uracil (U) as a base instead of thymine (see p. 16). Uracil always pairs with adenine during protein synthesis. RNA isn't all the same though. You need to know about:(Messenger RNA (mRNA))mRNA is made during transcription (see below). It carries the genetic code from the DNA to the ribosomes, where it's used to make a protein during translation (see next page). mRNA is a single ^ Basepolynucleotide strand.In mRNA, groups of three adjacent bases are usually called codons (they're sometimes Phosphate called triplets or base triplets). Ribose sugarvcodon(Transfer RNA (tRNA))tRNA is involved in translation. It carries the amino acids that are used to make proteins to the ribosomes. tRNA is a single polynucleotide strand that's folded into a clover shape. Hydrogen bonds between specific base pairs hold the molecule in this shape.Every tRNA molecule has a specific sequence of three bases at one end called an anticodon.They also have an amino acid binding site at the other end.AnticodonAmino acid binding siteHydrogen bonds between base pairsFirst Stage of Protein Synthesis \u2014  TranscriptionDuring transcription, an mRNA copy of a gene is made from DNA.In eukaryotic cells, transcription takes place in the nucleus.(Prokaryotes don't have a nucleus, so transcription takes place in the cytoplasm.Transcription starts when RNA polymerase (an enzyme) attaches to the DNA double-helix at the beginning of a gene.The hydrogen bonds between the two DNA strands in the gene break, separating the strands, and the DNA molecule uncoils at that point, exposing some of the bases.One of the strands is then used as a template to make an mRNA copy.vma\\|Cytopla1)2)RNA j polymerase;f \/T |Nucleusl|Template \/ strand of DNA3)RNA njcleotides joined togethernucleotides4)5)The RNA polymerase lines up free RNA nucleotides alongside the exposed bases on the template strand.

This means that some amino acids are coded for by more than one base triplet, e.g. tyrosine can be coded for by UAU or UAC.4) Some triplets are used to tell the cell when to start and stop production of the protein \u2014 these are called start and stop signals (or codons). They're found at the beginning and end of the mRNA. E.g. UAG is a stop signal.5) The genetic code is also universal \u2014 the same specific base triplets code for the same amino acids in all living things. E.g.

Cells that divide by meiosis are diploid to start with, but the cells that are formed from meiosis are haploid \u2014 the chromosome number halves. Without meiosis, you'd get double the number of chromosomes when the gametes fused. Not good.1) Before meiosis starts, the DNA unravels and replicates so there are two copies of each chromosome, called chromatids.2) The DNA condenses to form double-armed chromosomes, each made from two sister chromatids. The sister chromatids are joined in the middle by a centromere.3) Meiosis I (first division) \u2014 the chromosomes arrange themselves into homologous pairs4) These homologous pairs are then separated, halving the chromosome number.5) Meiosis II (second division) \u2014 the pairs of sister chromatids that make up each chromosome are separated (the centromere is divided).6) Four haploid cells (gametes) that are genetically different from each other are producedIn the exams, you might need to spot when meiosis happens in an organism with a life cycle you haven't seen before, e.g. an insect or plant. Just remember (hat in any organism, meiosis is needed for sexual reproduction because it produces daughter cells (gametes) with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell.You might also be told how many chromosomes are in a parent cell, then asked to complete diagrams showing how many chromosomes will be in the daughter cells after the first and second divisions of meiosis. Remember that the chromosome number is halved during the first division.A Note About Homologous Pairs: Humans have 46 chromosomes in total \u2014 23 pairs.

The chromatids still contain the same genes but now have a different combination of alleles.Chromatids of one chromosomeCrossing over occurs between chromatidsChromatids now have a new combination of allelesMeiosis Produces Cells that are Genetically DifferentThere are two main events during meiosis that lead to genetic variation:(l^Crossing over of chromatidsThe crossing over of chromatids in meiosis I means that each of the four daughter cells formed from meiosis contains chromatids with different alleles:The chromosomes of homologous pairs come together.MEIOSIS IChromatids cross over.\nMEIOSISOne chromosome from each homologous pair ends up in each cell.Each cell has a different chromatid and therefore a different set of alleles, which increases genetic variation.(2) Independent segregation of chromosomer1) Each homologous pair of chromosomes in your cells is made up of one chromosome from your mum (maternal) and one chromosome from your dad (paternal).2) When the homologous pairs are separated in meiosis I, it's completely random which chromosome from each pair ends up in which daughter cell.3) So the four daughter cells produced by meiosis have completely different combinations of those maternal and paternal chromosomes.4) This is called independent segregation (separation) of the chromosomes.5) This 'shuffling' of chromosomes leads to genetic variation in any potential offspring.MEIOSISPaternalMaternalORPossible combinations in daughter cellsMeiosis Has a Different Outcome to MitosisYou may remember mitosis from page 32. Mitosis and meiosis have different outcomes:Outcomes:MitosisProduces cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell.Daughter cells are genetically identical to each other and to the parent cell.Produces two daughter cells.MeiosisProduces cells with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.Daughter cells are genetically different from one another and the parent cell.Produces four daughter cells.You need to be able to explain the different outcomes of mitosis and meiosis. They're different because mitosis only involves one division (which separates the sister chromatids) whereas meiosis has two divisions (which separate the homologous pairs and then the sister chromatids). There's no pairing or separating of homologous chromosomes in mitosis, and so no crossing over or independent segregation of chromosomes. This produces genetically identical daughter cells \u2014 unlike meiosis.Topic 4B \u2014 Diversity, Classification and Variation\n","46":"92Genetic Diversity and Natural SelectionGenetic diversity describes the number of alleles in a species or population, and natural selection acts to increase the proportion of advantageous alleles.

This may lead to a higher incidence of genetic disease.3) The founder effect can occur as a result of migration leading to geographical separation or if a newcolony is separated from the original population for another reason, such as religion.Example \u2014The AmishThe Amish population of North America are all descended from a small number of Swiss who migrated there. The population shows little genetic diversity. They have remained isolated from the surrounding population due to their religious beliefs, so few new alleles have been introduced.

Natural selection affects different populations in different ways, as you'll soon discover...Different Types of Natural Selection Lead to Different Frequency PatternsYou might remember from the previous page that natural selection alters allele frequency in a population. Stabilising selection and directional selection are types of natural selection that affect allele frequencyin different ways. You need to learn these examples:Antibiotic Resistance Shows Directional SelectionDirectional selection is where individuals with alleles for characteristics of an extreme type are more likely to survive and reproduce. This could be in response to an environmental change. Bacteria evolving antibiotic resistance is an example of directional selection. Here's how it works:1) Some individuals in a population have alleles that give them resistance to an antibiotic.2) The population is exposed to the antibiotic, killing bacteria without the resistant allele.3) The resistant bacteria survive and reproduce without competition, passing on the allele that gives antibiotic resistance to their offspring.4) After some time, most organisms in the population will carry the antibiotic resistance allele.PARENTSik totali iton$3T5population \/\"rrs\\ breeding ^\u0000>_CA-^population ^o\/ \\ l=^> t<y_Ci1 \\ \/ \\\u00a3c\/ \\ \u00a3 \\ 3 \\ C---------^ . \u0000OFFSPRING\nlowantibiotic resistancehighantibiotic resistanceHuman Birth Weight Shows Stabilising SelectionStabilising selection is where individuals with alleles for characteristics towards the middle of the range are more likely to survive and reproduce. It occurs when the environment isn't changing, and it reduces the range of possible characteristics. An example of stabilising selection is human birth weight.1) Humans have a range of birth weights.2) Very small babies are less likely to survive \u2014 partly because they find it hard to maintain their body temperature.3) Giving birth to large babies can be difficult, so large babies are less likely to survive too.4) Conditions are most favourable for medium-sized babies \u2014 so weight of human babies tends to shift towards the middle of the range.PARENTStotal populationbreedingpopulationOFFSPRING\nweight of babylight--!\"\u0000weight of baby hcav7You Need to be Able to Interpret Data on the Effects of SelectionYou might be asked to interpret information about an unfamiliar species in the exam.

Orangutans were the first group to diverge (evolve to become a different species) from this common ancestor.Each of the following branch points represents another common ancestor from which a different group diverged. Gorillas diverged next, then humans, closely followed by bonobos and chimpanzees.Closely related species diverged away from each other most recently. E.g. humans and chimpanzees are closely related, as they diverged very recently. You can see this because their branches are close together.\u0000 Gorilla\nClassification is All About Grouping Together Related OrganismsTaxonomy is the science of classification. It involves naming organisms and organising them into groups.This makes it easier to identify and study them. Scientists now take into account phylogeny when classifying organisms, and group organisms according to their evolutionary relationships.1) There are eight levels of groups used to classify organisms.These groups are called taxa. Each group is called a taxon.2) The groups are arranged in a hierarchy, with the largest groups at the top and the smallest groups at the bottom.Organisms can only belong to one group at each level in the hierarchy \u2014 there's no overlap.3) Organisms are first sorted into three large groups (or taxa) called domains \u2014 the Eukarya, Bacteria and Archaea.4) Related organisms in a domain are then sorted into slightly smaller groups called kingdoms, e.g. all animalsare in the animal kingdom. More closely related organisms from that kingdom are then groupedinto a phylum, then grouped into a class, and so on down the eight levels of the hierarchy.DomainKingdomPhylumClassOrderFamilyGenusSpecies- You need to learn -\"ames andorder of the groups -5)6)As you move down the hierarchy, there are more groups at each level but fewer organisms in each group. The organisms in each group also become more closely related.The hierarchy ends with species \u2014 the groups that contain only one type of organism (e.g. humans, dogs, E. coll). You need to learn the definition of a species:A species is a group of similar organisms able to reproduce to give fertile offspring.7) Scientists constantly update classification systems because of discoveries about new species and new evidence about known organisms (e.g. DNA sequence data \u2014 see page 98).Topic 4B \u2014 Diversity, Classification and Variation\n","49":"98DNA Technology, Classification and DiversityAdvances in DNA and molecular technology have led to advances in many other fields.For example, scientists have been able to use the technology to help classify organisms more accurately...Advances in Techniques Can Clarify Evolutionary RelationshipsNew or improved technologies can result in new discoveries being made and the relationships between organisms being clarified. This can lead to classification systems being updated. Technologies that have been useful for clarifying evolutionary relationships include:Genome sequencing \u2014 Advances in genome sequencing have meant that the entire base sequence of an organism's DNA can be determined. The DNA base sequence of one organism can then be compared to the DNA base sequence of another organism, to see how closely related they are. Closely related species will have a higher percentage of similarity in their DNA base order, e.g. humans and chimps share around 94%, humans and mice share about 86%.Genome sequencing has clarified the relationship between skunks and members of the Mustelidae family (e.g. weasels and badgers). Skunks were classified in the Mustelidae family until their DNA sequence was revealed to be significantly different to other members of that family. So they were reclassified into the family Mephitidae.Comparing amino acid sequence \u2014 Proteins are made of amino acids. The sequence of amino acids in a protein is coded for by the base sequence in DNA (see p. 82). Related organisms have similar DNA sequences and so similar amino acid sequences in their proteins. E.g. cytochrome C is a short protein found in many species. The more similar the amino acid sequence of cytochrome C in two different species, the more closely related the species are likely to be.Immunological comparisons \u2014 Similar proteinswill also bind the same antibodies (see p. 44).

Some habitats will be more biodiverse than others.2) Global biodiversity \u2014 you could also consider the variety of species on fcarlh. Recent estimates put the total number of species on tarth at about 8.7 million. Biodiversity varies in different parts of the world \u2014 it is greatest at the equator and decreases towards the poles.Pete wasn't sure that the company's new increased biodiversity policy would be good for productivity.Biodiversity Can be Measured Using an Index of Diversity1) Species richness is a measure of the number of different species in a community. It can be worked out by taking random samples of a community (see page 100) and counting the number of different species.2) Species richness is also a simple measure of biodiversity. But the number of different species in a communityisn't the only thing that affects biodiversity. The population sizes of those species do too. Species that are in acommunity in very small numbers shouldn't be treated the same as those with bigger populations.3) An index of diversity is another way of measuring biodiversity. It's calculated using an equation that takes both the number of species in a community (species richness) and the abundance of each species (population sizes) into account.4) You can calculate an index of diversity (d) using this formula:dN(N - 1) X n(n -  1)Where...N = Total number of organisms of all species n = Total number of organisms of one species X = 'Sum of' (i.e. added together)111 *11111 I I I I I I I \/ I I I I,Z.

Here's a quick recap:AdenineATPPhosphate groupsPhosphate bond1) A cell can't get its energy directly from glucose.2) So, in respiration, the energy released from glucose is used to make ATP (adenosine triphosphate).ATP carries energy around the cell to where it's needed.3) ATP is synthesised via a condensation reaction between ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (P.) using energy from an energy-releasing reaction, e.g. the breakdown of glucose in respiration. The energy is stored as chemical energy in the phosphate bond. The enzyme ATP synthase catalyses this reaction.4) ATP diffuses to the part of the cell that needs energy.5) Here, it's hydrolysed back into ADP and inorganic phosphate (P;). Chemical energy is releasedfrom the phosphate bond and used by the cell. ATP hydrolase catalyses this reaction.6) The ADP and inorganic phosphate are recycled and the process starts again.Topic 5 A \u2014 Photosynthesis and Respiration\n","52":"144Muscle ContractionMyofilaments sliding over one another takes a lot of energy \u2014 probably why exercise is such hard work...Myosin Filaments Have Globular Heads and Binding Sitestropomyosinactinfilament1) Myosin filaments have globular heads that are hinged, so they can move back and forth.2) Each myosin head has a binding site for actin and a binding site for ATP.3) Actin filaments have binding sites for myosin heads, called actin-myosin binding sites.4) Another protein called tropomyosin is found between actin filaments.It helps myofilaments move past each other.Binding Sites in Resting Muscles are Blocked by Tropomyosin1) In a resting (unstimulated) muscle the actin-myosin binding site is blocked by tropomyosin.2) So myofilaments can't slide past each other because the myosin heads can't bind to the actin-myosin binding site on the actin filaments.myosinglobularhead\ntropomyosin blocks the\" binding siteMuscle Contraction is Triggered by an Influx of Calcium IonsD2)When an action potential from a motor neurone stimulates a muscle cell, it depolarises the sarcolemma. Depolarisation spreads down the T-tubules to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (see p. 142). This causcs the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release stored calcium ions (Ca2+) into the sarcoplasm.3) Calcium ions bind to a protein attached toCa * binds to a protein, which moves tropomyosinmyosin head_ binds to the exposed siteactin-myosin cross bridge formedtropomyosin, causing the protein to change shape. This pulls the attached tropomyosin out of the actin-myosin binding site on the actin filament.4) This exposes the binding site, which allows the myosin head to bind.5) The bond formed when a myosin head binds to an actin filament is called an actin-myosin cross bridge.6)Calcium ions also activate the enzyme ATP hydrolase which hydrolyses (breaks down) ATP (into ADP + P;) to provide the energy needed for muscle contraction. ^ The energy released from ATP causes the myosin head to bend, which pulls the actin filament along in a kind of rowing action.Another ATP molecule provides the energy to break the actin-myosin cross bridge, so the myosin head detaches from the actin filament after it's moved.The myosin head then reattaches to a different binding site further along the actin filament. A new actin-myosin cross bridge is formed and the cycle is repeated (attach, move, detach, reattach to new binding site...)10) Many cross bridges form and break very rapidly, pulling the actin filament along \u2014 which shortens the sarcomere, causing the muscle to contract11) The cycle will continue as long as calcium ions are present.movement7)8)9)cross bridge breaksmyosin head reattaches to the next binding siteWhen Excitation Stops, Calcium Ions Leave1) When the muscle stops being stimulated, calcium ions leave their binding sites and are moved by active transport back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (this needs ATP too).2) This causes the tropomyosin molecules to move back, so they block the actin-myosin binding sites again.3) Muscles aren't contracted because no myosin heads are attached mm to actin filaments (so there are no actin-myosin cross bridges).4) The actin filaments slide back to their relaxed position, which lengthens the sarcomere.actin filaments slide backtropomyosin blocks the binding sites againTopic 6B \u2014 Nervous Coordination\n","53":"146Topic 6C \u2014 HomeostasisHomeostasis BasicsAh, there's nothing like learning a nice long word to start you off on a new section \u2014 welcome to homeostasis.Homeostasis is the Maintenance of a Stable Internal Environment1) Changes in your external environment can affect your internal environment\u2014 the blood and tissue fluid that surrounds your cells.2) Homeostasis involves control systems that keep your internal environment roughly constant (within certain limits).3) Keeping your internal environment stable is vital for cells to function normally and to stop them being damaged.4) It's particularly important to maintain the right core body temperature and blood pH. This is because temperature and pH affect enzyme activity, and enzymes control the rate of metabolic reactions:\u2022 If body temperature is too high (e.g. 40 \u00b0C) enzymes may becomc denatured. The enzyme's molecules vibrate too much, which breaks the hydrogen bonds that hold them in their 3D shape.The shape of the enzyme's active site is changed and it no longer works as a catalyst.This means metabolic reactions are less efficient.\u2022 If body temperature is too low enzyme activity is reduced, slowing the rate of metabolic reactions.\u2022 The highest rate of enzyme activity happens at their optimum temperature (about 37 \u00b0C in humans).\u2022 If blood pH is too high or too low (highly alkaline or acidic) enzymes become denatured. The hydrogen bonds that hold them in their 3D shape are broken, so the shape of the enzyme's active site is changed and it no longer works as a catalyst. This means metabolic reactions are less efficient.\u2022 The highest rate of enzyme activity happens at their optimum pH \u2014 usually around pH 7 (neutral), but some enzymes work best at other pHs, e.g. enzymes found in the stomach work best at a low pH.5) It's important to maintain the right concentration of glucose in the blood because cells need glucose for energy. Blood glucose concentration also affects the water potential of blood \u2014 this is the potential (likelihood)of water molecules to diffuse out of or into a solution.\u2022 If blood glucose concentration is too high the water potential of blood is reduced to a point where water molecules diffuse out of cells into the blood by osmosis.This can cause the cells to shrivel up and die.\u2022 If blood glucose concentration is too low, cells are unable to carry out normal activities because there isn't enough glucose for respiration to provide energy.Homeostatic Systems Detect a Change and Respond by Negative Feedback1)2)3)4)5)6)Homeostatic systems involve receptors, a communication system and effectors (like the nervous system \u2014 see page 128).Receptors detect when a level is too high or too low, and the information's communicated via the nervous system or the hormonal system to effectors.The effectors respond to counteract the change \u2014 bringing the level back to normal. The mechanism that restores the level to normal is called a negative feedback mechanism.Negative feedback keeps things around the normal level, e.g. body temperature is usually kept within 0.5 \u00b0C above or below 37 \u00b0C.Negative feedback only works within certain limits though \u2014 if the change is too big then the effectors may not be able to counteract it, e.g. a huge drop in body temperature caused by prolonged exposure to cold weather may be too large to counteract.Control of body temperature by negative feedback:body detects temperature's too hotyour internal environment stays around the normal level (37 \u00b0C)body detects temperature's too coldeffectors respond to increase the temperaturetimea>ouJ3u\nTopic 6C \u2014 Homeostasis\n","54":"148Control of Blood Glucose ConcentrationThese pages are all about how homeostasis sorts out your blood glucose level so you can keep revising.Eating and Exercise Change the Concentration of Glucose in your Blood1) All cells need a constant energy supply to work \u2014 so blood glucose concentration must be carefully controlled.2) The concentration of glucose in the blood is normally around 90 mg per 100 cm3 of blood.It's monitored by cells in the pancreas.3) Blood glucose concentration rises after eating food containing carbohydrate.Blood glucose concentration falls after exercise, as more glucose is used in respiration to release energy.Insulin and Glucagon Control Blood Glucose ConcentrationThe hormonal system controls blood glucose concentration using two hormones called insulin and glucagon.Like all hormones, insulin and glucagon travel in the blood to .... , ,, ,their target cells (effectors).

This involves increasing the number of channel proteins in the cell membranes (see next page for more).Insulin also activates enzymes in liver and muscle cells that convert glucose into glycogen. The cells are able to store glycogen in their cytoplasm, as an energy source.The process of forming glycogen from glucose is called glycogenesis.Insulin also increases the rate of respiration of glucose, especially in muscle cells.i |l I II I \/11 ir Liver cells are C f also called E^ Hepatocytes. ~\/' I I I I W I | | | |\\N\"GLYCOGENGlucagon raises blood glucose concentration when it's too lowglycogenesis 11 glycogenolysiss \\l ^activated activatedby insulin \u00bb by glucagon^ .I gluconeogenesisGLYCEROL AMINO ACIDS1) Glucagon binds to specific receptors on the cell membranes of liver cells.2) Glucagon activates enzymes in liver cells that break down glycogen into glucose3) The process of breaking down glycogen is called glycogenolysis.4) Glucagon also activates enzymes that are involved in the formation of glucose from glycerol (a component of lipids) and amino acids.5) The process of forming glucose from non-carbohydrates is called gluconeogenesis6) Glucagon decreases the rate of respiration of glucose in cells.Because they travel in the blood to their target cells, the responses produced by hormones are slower than those produced by nervous impulses (which are very quick \u2014 see page 129).

So, whether you feel the need for some speed or not, read on \u2014 because you really need to know this basic stuff about enzymes.Enzymes are Biological CatalystsEnzymes speed up chemical reactions by acting as biological catalysts. A catalyst is a substance _1)2)3)4)5)6)- readior without being _r up in the reaction\"'t 11 n ' i\" 111\" 1Enzymes catalyse metabolic reactions \u2014 both at a cellular level (e.g. respiration) and for the organism as a whole (e.g. digestion in mammals).Enzymes can affect structures in an organism (e.g. enzymes are involved in the production of collagen, an important protein in the connective tissues of animals) as well as functions (like respiration).Enzyme action can be intracellular \u2014 within cells, or extracellular \u2014 outside cells.Enzymes are proteins (see previous page).Enzymes have an active site, which has a specific shape. The active site is the part of the enzyme where the substrate molecules (the substance that the enzyme interacts with) bind to.Enzymes are highly specific due to their tertiary structure (see next page).Enzymes Lower the Activation Energy of a ReactionIn a chemical reaction, a certain amount of energy needs to be supplied to the chemicals before the reaction will start. This is called the activation energy \u2014 it's often provided as heat. Enzymes lower the amount of activation energy that's needed, often making reactions happen at a lower temperature than they could without an enzyme. This speeds up the rate of reaction.When a substrate fits into the enzyme's active site it forms an enzyme-substrate complex \u2014 it's this that lowers the activation energy. Here are two reasons why:1) If two substrate molecules need to be joined, being attached to the enzyme holds them close together, reducing any repulsion between the molecules so they can bond more easily.2) If the enzyme is catalysing a breakdown reaction, fitting into the active site puts a strain on bonds in the substrate, so the substrate molecule breaks up more easily.chemical reaction beginsactivation ener^y_neede_d _ without enzymeenergy is released as the product is formedTime- chemical reaction without enzyme-chemicalreactionwithenzymeThe \u2018L o c k  and K e y \u2019 Model is a Good Start...Enzymes are a bit picky \u2014 they only work with substrates that fit their active site. Early scientists studying the action of enzymes came up with the lock and key' model. This is where the substrate fits into the enzyme in the same way that a key fits into a lock.enzyme is unchanged\ncomplexScientists soon realised that the lock and key model didn't give the full story. The enzyme and substrate do have to fit together in the first place, but new evidence showed that the enzyme-substrate complex changed shape slightly to complete the fit. This locks the substrate even more tightly to the enzyme. Scientists modified the old lock and key model and came up with the 'induced fit' model.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","56":"150Control of Blood Glucose ConcentrationHomeostasis doesn't always work. One example of this is diabetes...Diabetes Occurs when Blood Glucose Concentration is Not ControlledDiabetes mellitus is a condition where blood glucose concentration can't be controlled properly. There are two types:1) In Type I diabetes, the immune system attacks the (3 cells in the islets of Langerhans so they can't produce any insulin. No one knows exactly what causes the immune system to do this.Scientists have found that some people have a genetic predisposition to developing Type I diabetes. They also think that the disease may be triggered by a viral infection.2) After eating, the blood glucose level rises and stays high \u2014 this is called hyperglycaemia and can result in death if left untreated. The kidneys can't reabsorb all this glucose, so some of it's excreted in the urine.3) Type 1 diabetes is treated with insulin therapy. Most people with Type I diabetes need regular insulin injections throughout the day, but some people use an insulin pump to deliver insulin continuously instead. Insulin therapy has to be carefully controlled because too much insulin can produce a dangerous drop in blood glucose levels \u2014 this is called hypoglycaemia.4) Eating regularly and controlling simple carbohydrate intake (intake of sugars) helps to avoid a sudden rise in glucose.1) Type II diabetes is usually acquired later in life than Type I. It is often linked with obesity and is more likely in people with a family history of the condition. Other risk factors include lack of exercise, age and poor diet.2) It occurs when the |3 cells don't produce enough insulin or when the body's cells don't respond properly to insulin. Cells don't respond properly because the insulin receptors on their membranes don't work properly, so the cells don't take up enough glucose. This means the blood glucose concentration is higher than normal.3) It can be treated by eating a healthy, balanced diet, losing weight (if necessary) and regular exercise. Glucose-lowering medication can be taken if diet and exercise can't control it. Eventually, insulin injections may be needed.Type II Diabetes is a Growing Health Problem1) Type II diabetes is becoming increasingly common in the UK. This has been linked to increasing levels of obesity, a move towards more unhealthy diets and low levels of physical activity.2) Type II diabetes can cause additional health problems, including visual impairment and kidney failure, so health advisors are understandably keen to educate people about the risks and reduce the incidenceof the disease. Some people also think the food industry has a role to play in tackling the problem.3) You need to understand the various responses to the increase in Type II diabetes and be able to evaluate them.To reduce the risk of developing Type II diabetes, health advisors recommend that people:\u2022 eat a diet that's low in fat, sugar and salt, with plenty of whole grains, fruit and vegetables,\u2022 take regular exercise,\u2022 lose weight if necessary.Campaigns like the NHS's 'Change4Life', aim to educate people on how to have a healthier diet and lifestyle, and so reduce their risk of developing conditions like Type II diabetes.Health advisors have also challenged the food industry to reduce the advertising of junk food (particularly to children), to improve the nutritional value of their products, and to use clearer labelling on products \u2014 allowing consumers to make healthier choices about what to buy.w 1111111111 u h 111 ii \\ 111 ii 111111 \\ \\ h 111,In response to criticism, some food companies have z Some people believe that diet varieties are not zattempted to make their products more healthy, e.g. 5 as 300^ ^or health as they are claimed to be, z.. r ,, 1 . 1 - e.q. there is some evidence to suqaest that\u2022 using sugar alternatives to sweeten tood\/drinks, z Jr \u0000 , . , ,. . ,. z 00 ^ artificial sweeteners are linked to weight gain. ^\u2022 reducing the sugar, fat and salt content of products. 111111 w 11 n n 1 u 1111111111 w 111111 uHowever, there is pressure on companies to increase profits.

This process is called ultrafiltration.4) Useful substances, such as glucose and the right amount of water, are then reabsorbed back into the blood. This process is called selective reabsorption.5) The remaining unwanted substances pass along to the bladder and are excreted as urine.Blood is Filtered at the Start of the NephronsThe long tubules along with the bundle of capillarieswhere the blood is filtered are called nephrons \u2014there are around one million nephrons in each kidney.1) Blood from the renal artery enters smaller arterioles in the cortex of the kidney.2) Each arteriole splits into a structure called a glomerulus (plural, glomeruli) \u2014 a bundle of capillaries looped inside a hollow ball called a Bowman's capsule.3) This is where ultrafiltration takes place.4) The arteriole that takes blood into each glomerulus is called the afferent arteriole, and the arteriole that takes the filtered blood away from the glomerulus is called the efferent arteriole.5) The efferent arteriole is smaller in diameter than the afferent arteriole, so the blood in the glomerulus is under high pressure.6) The high pressure forces liquid and small molecules in the blood out of the capillary and into the Bowman's capsule.7) The liquid and small molecules pass through three layers to get into the Bowman's capsule and enter the nephron tubules \u2014 the capillary wall, a membrane (called the basement membrane) and the epithelium of the Bowman's capsule.8) Larger molecules like proteins and blood cells can't pass through, so stay in the blood. The substances that enter the Bowman's capsule are known as the glomerular filtrate.UltrafiltrationStructure of the Kidneys renal renal\n\u00a9CAPILLARYlarger molecules can't pass througho slit in BOWMAN'S, epithelium CAPSULE *basementmembranesmall molecules forced through11 *111 m 11111Ti i n i; ii, 5 You need to learn the = ~ structure of a nephron.

Instead you take samples:1) Choose an area to sample \u2014 a small area within the area being investigated.2) Samples should be random to avoid bias, e.g. if you were investigating a field you could pick random samplesites by dividing the field into a grid and using a random number generator to select coordinates.3) Use an appropriate technique to take a sample of the population (see below).4) Repeat the process, taking as many samples as possible.This will reduce the likelihood that your results are down to chance.5) The number of individuals for the whole area can then be estimated by taking the mean ofthe data collected in each sample and multiplying it by the size of the whole area.Quadrats and Transects are used to Investigate Non-Motile OrganismsNon-motile organisms are ones that don't move about\u2014 like plants. Quadrats and transects can also be used to investigate slow-moving organisms, which include things like limpets.1) A quadrat is a square frame, usually divided into a grid of 100 smaller squares by strings attached across the frame.2) Quadrats are placed on the ground at different points within the area you're investigating.3) The species frequency (how often a species is found) or the number of individuals of each species is recorded in each quadrat.4) The percentage cover of a species can also be measured by counting how much of the quadrat is covered by the speciesthe area of this quadrat is 0.25 rrMeasuring % cover0.5 mI I Species A [~ ~ l Specif, B 42 squares 12 squaresyou count a square if it's more than half-covered.

To cover a larger distance, quadrats can be placed at intervals along the line (i.e. with spaces in between them). This is known as an interrupted belt transect.Mark-Release-Recapture is Used to Investigate More Motile SpeciesMark-release-recapture is a method used to measure the abundance of more motile species. Here's how it's done:1) Capture a sample of a species using an appropriate technique, e.g. you could use pitfall traps(a steep sided container sunk into the ground) to capture ground insects, and count them.2) Mark them in a harmless way, e.g. by putting a spot of paint on them, or by removing a tuft of fur.3) Release them back into their habitat.4) Wait a week, then take a second sample from the same population.5) Count how many of the second sample are marked.You can then use this equation to estimate the total population size.When using this method, you have to make a few assumptions:1) The marked sample has had enough time and opportunity to mix back in with the population.2) The marking hasn't affected the individuals' chances of survival (e.g. by making them more visible to predators), and the marking itself is still visible (e.g. it hasn't rubbed off).3) There are no changes in population size due to births, deaths and migration during the period of the study.Topic 7C \u2014 Populations in EcosystemsJ0ta| Number caught Number caughtpopulation = 'n sample in 2nd samplesize ____________Number marked in 2nd sample\n","59":"776SuccessionRepeat after me: successful succession involves several simple successive stages.Succession is the Process of Ecosystem ChangeEcosystems are dynamic \u2014 they are constantly changing. Succession is the process by which an ecosystem(see p. 170) changes over time. The biotic conditions (e.g. plant and animal communities) change n H , M mn 11\/as the abiotic conditions (e.g. water availability) change. There are two types of succession: ^ Remember \u20141) Primary succession \u2014 this happens on land that's been newly formed or exposed, e.g. ~ Abiotic ^non-tving' where a volcano has erupted to form a new rock surface, or where sea level has droppedexposing a new area of land. There's no soil or organic material to start with, e.g. just bare rock.2) Secondary succession \u2014 this happens on land that's been cleared of all the plants, but where the soil remains, e.g. after a forest fire or where a forest has been cut down by humans.Succession Occurs in a Series of Stages1)\n2)3)4)5)Primary succession starts when species colonise a new land surface. Seeds and spores are blown in by the wind and begin to grow. The first species to colonise the area are called pioneer species.\u2022 The abiotic conditions are hostile (harsh), e.g. there's no soil to retain water. Only pioneer species grow because they're specially adapted to cope with the harsh conditions, e.g. marram grass can grow on sand dunes near the sea because it has deep roots to get water and can tolerate the salty environment.\u2022 The pioneer species change the abiotic conditions \u2014 they die and microorganisms decompose the dead organic material (humus). This forms a basic soil.\u2022 This makes conditions less hostile, e.g. the basic soil helps to retain water, which means new organisms with different adaptations can move in and grow. These then die and are decomposed, adding more organic material, making the soil deeper and richer in minerals. This means larger plants like shrubs can start to grow in the deeper soil, which retains even more water.\u2022 Some new species may change (he environment so that it becomes less suitable for the previous species.E.g. sand sedge stabilises the sand through the growth of rhizomes (underground stems). This makes the conditions less suitable for marram grass, which needs constant reburial by sand in order to grow healthily.Secondary succession happens in the same way, but because there's already a soil layer succession starts at a later stage \u2014 the pioneer species in secondary succession are larger plants, e.g. shrubs.At each stage, different plants and animals that are better adapted for the improved conditions move in, out-compete the plants and animals that are already there, and become the dominant species in the ecosystem. As succession goes on, the ecosystem becomes more complex. New species move in alongside existing species, which means that biodiversity (the variety of living organisms) increases. xw 11M 111 m M ,The final stage is called the climax community \u2014 the ecosystem - This ----is supporting the largest and most complex community of plants and animals it can.

E.g. lichens grow on and break down rocks, releasing minerals.2) The lichens die and are decomposed helping to form a thin soil, which thickens as more organic material is formed. This means other species such as mosses can grow3) Larger plants that need more water can move in asthe soil deepens, e.g. grasses and small flowering plants. The soil continues to deepen as the larger plants die and are decomposed.4) Shrubs, ferns and small trees begin to grow, out-competing the grasses and smaller plants to become the dominant species. Diversity increases.5) Finally, the soil is deep and rich enough in nutrients to support large trees. These become the dominant species, and the climax community is formed.1111i11111111111 2)thin soilsmall trees (rowan and alder)fernslarge treesand ash)deep soilTopic 7C \u2014 Populations in Ecosystems\n","60":"178ConservationWho'cJ have thought conservation could be such a tricky business \u2014 cos I'm feeling nice, I'll try and explain why...There Can be Conflict Between Human Needs and Conservation1) Conservation is the protection and management of species and habitats (ecosystemsi in a sustainable way. Sustainable means that enough resources are taken to meet the needs of people today, without reducing the ability of people in the future to meet their own needs.2) Not everyone agrees with every conservation measure though \u2014 there's often conflict between human needs and conservation. Careful management is needed to find a balance between the two and maintain the sustainability of natural resources. Here's an example:\u2022 The Maasai Mara is a national reserve in Kenya. It's a large area of grassland (savannah) with lots of wildlife.\u2022 The Maasai people traditionally earn a living by raising livestock, such as cattle. This can bring them into conflict with conservationists \u2014 e.g. overgrazing by livestock can destroy grassland for wildlife.\u2022 Conservation trusts are working with the Maasai to help them make money from their land through conservation and ecotourism projects rather than farming, and to farm in a sustainable way. So the economic needs of the Maasai are met, while still allowing the area and its wildlife to be conserved.3) There are many different methods of conservation. Some focus on conserving a particular species, whilst others protect the habitat for all the species that live there. Here are some examples of conservation techniques:\u2022 Plants can be conserved using seedbanks, which are stores of lots of seeds from lots of different plant species. If the plants become extinct in the wild, the stored seeds can be used to grow new plants.\u2022 Fishing quotas are limits to the amount of certain fish species that fishermen are allowed to catch.Fishing quotas help to conserve fish species by reducing the numbers that are caught and killed.\u2022 Protected areas such as national parks and nature reserves protect habitats (and so protect the species in them) by restricting urban development, industrial development and farming.\u2022 Endangered species can be bred in captivity (e.g. a zoo) to increase their numbers, then returned to the wild.You May Have to Evaluate Evidence and Data About Conservation IssuesYou need to be able to evaluate any evidence or data about conservation projects and research that the examiners throw at you \u2014 so here's an example I made earlier:In recent years, native British bluebells have become less common in woodland areas. It's thought that this is due to the presence of non-native Spanish bluebells, which compete with the native species for a similar niche.An experiment was carried out to see if removing the invasive Spanish species would help to conserve the native species. Each year for 15 years the percentage cover of native species was estimated in a 50 m by 50 m area of woodland using random sampling and 250, 1 m2 quadrats. After five years, all the Spanish bluebells were removed. A similar-sized control woodland in which the Spanish bluebells remained untouched was also studied. The results are shown on the right. You might be asked to:= 100806040% cover of native British bluebells in a woodland\u2022Spanish species removed5 10years151) Describe the data:\u2022 For the first five years, the percentage cover of native bluebells fell \u0000 ^from 50% to around 25%. After the Spanish species was removed, it increased from around 25% to around 45% in ten years.\u2022 The control experiment shows a fairly steady drop in native bluebell ^ percentage cover from 60% to 20% over the 15 years.2) Draw conclusions:The removal of Spanish bluebells resulted in an increase in the percentage cover of native bluebells over a ten year period. This suggests that the recent decrease in native British bluebells is due to competition with the Spanish bluebells.3) Ey^l.UAte_the..methQd;\u2022 The effects of some olher variables (e.g. changing weather) were removed by the control experiment, where the percentage cover of native bluebells continued to fall throughout the 15-year study. This increases the validity of the results.\u2022 The study area and sample size were quite large, giving more accurate data.\u2022 Random sampling removed bias \u2014 the data's more likely to be an accurate estimate of the whole area.100-1 Control experiment\nTopic 7C \u2014 Populations in Ecosystems\n","61":"180 Topic 8A \u2014 Mutations and Gene ExpressionMutationsUnfortunately, mutations don't usually give you special powers like in superhero movies \u2014 in fact, they can be quite harmful. You've already covered mutations in Topic 4, but now you need to know about them in more detail.Mutations are Changes to the Base Sequence of DNA1) Any change to the base (nucleotide) sequence of DNA is called a mutation.2) Mutations can be caused by errors during DNA replication.3) The rate of mutation can be increased by mutagenic agents (see next page).4) The types of mutations that can occur include:\u2022 Substitution \u2014 one or more bases are swapped for another, e.g. ATGCCT becomes ATTCCT.\u2022 Deletion \u2014 one or more bases are removed, e.g. ATGCCT becomes ATCCT.\u2022 Addition \u2014 one or more bases are added, e.g. ATGCCT becomes ATGACCT.\u2022 Duplication \u2014 one or more bases are repeated, e.g. ATGCCT becomes ATGCCCCT.\u2022 Inversion \u2014 a sequence of bases is reversed, e.g. ATGCCT becomes ACCGTT.\u2022 Translocation \u2014 a sequence of bases is moved from one location in the genome to another.This could be movement within the same chromosome or movement to a different chromosome.5) The order of DNA bases in a gene determines the sequence of amino acids in a particular polypeptide. If a mutation occurs in a gene, the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide that it codes for could be changed.OriginalgeneMutatedgeneC T J__Lc_LA G AI 1 1G GI__Isubstitution here G C A......................G AJ\u2014L.G G J\u2014IDNAAmino acidOriginalGCTAlaninepolypeptideGATAspartic acidCAGGlutamineMutatedAGGArgininepolypeptideAlanine \u2014 Glutamine \u2014 Arginine6) Polypeptides make up proteins. A change in the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide may change the final 3D shape of the protein, which could mean that it doesn't work properly. E.g. a mutation in a polypeptide that makes up an enzyme may change the shape of the enzyme's active site. This may stop substrates from being able to bind to the active site, leaving the enzyme unable to catalyse the reaction.7) Some mutations can cause genetic disorders \u2014 inherited disorders caused by abnormal genes or chromosomes, e.g. cystic fibrosis. Some mutations can increase the likelihood of developing certain cancers, e.g. mutations of the gene BRCA1 can increase the chances of developing breast cancer.8) If a gamete (sex cell) containing a mutation for a genetic disorder or a type of 1 1\"11'111'1\"'1 > \/ n\/,cancer is fertilised, the mutation will be present in the new fetus formed \u2014 5 *ier\u00ae^'tary mutations 5these are called hereditary mutations because they are passed on to the offspring. \u00a3 hereditary mutati^^cr31 ^3. evolution (see page 166).

There are lots of different types of cancer, but they all involve uncontrolled cell growth and all have potentially devastating effects. Here's more on how cancer can occur...Mutations in Genes Can Cause Uncontrolled Cell Growth1) Mutations that occur in individual cells after fertilisation (e.g. in adulthood) are called acquired mutations.2) If these mutations occur in the genes that control the rate of cell division (by mitosis), it can cause uncontrolled cell division.3) If a cell divides uncontrollably the result is a tumour \u2014 a mass of abnormal cells.Tumours that invade and destroy surrounding tissue are called cancers (see below).4) There are two types of gene that control cell division \u2014 tumour suppressor genesand proto-oncogenes. Mutations in these genes can cause cancer:Tumour suppressor genes can be inactivated if a mutation occurs in the DNA sequence.\nIf a mutation occurs in a tumour suppressor gene, the protein isn't produced. The cells divide uncontrollably (the rate of division increases) resulting in a tumour.The effect of a proto-oncogene can be increasedif a mutation occurs in the DNA sequence.A mutated proto-oncogene is called an oncogene.Proto-oncogeneIWhen functioning normally, proto-oncogenes stimulate cell division by producing proteins that make cells divide.Oncogene\nIf a mutation occurs in a proto-oncogene, the gene can become overactive. This stimulates the cells to divide uncontrollably (the rate of division increases) resulting in a tumour.Tumours can be Benign or Malignant (Cancerous)Tumours can develop for years without any obvious symptoms and can be quite large by the time they're discovered. Not all tumours are cancerous \u2014 there are two different types:1) Malignant tumours are cancers. They usually grow rapidly and invade and destroy surrounding tissues.Cells can break off the tumours and spread to other parts of the body in the bloodstream or lymphatic system.2) Benign tumours are not cancerous. They usually grow slower than malignant tumours and are often covered in fibrous tissue that stops cells invading other tissues. Benign tumours are often harmless,but they can cause blockages and put pressure on organs. Some benign tumours can become malignant.Tumour Cells Look and Function Differently to Normal CellsTumour cells can differ from normal cells in many different ways:1) They have an irregular shape.2) The nucleus is larger and darker than in normal cells. aSometimes the cells have more than one nucleus.3) They don't produce all the proteins needed to function correctly.4) They have different antigens on their surface.5) They don't respond to growth regulating processes.6) They divide (by mitosis) more frequently than normal cells.Topic 8A \u2014 Mutations and Gene ExpressionWhen functioning normally, tumour suppressor genes slow cell division by producing proteins that stop cells dividing or cause them to self-destruct (apoptosis).\n","63":"196 Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Proiects and Gene TechnologiesGenome Projects and Making DNA FragmentsGene technologies are seriously amazing.

So if you want to sequence the entire genome of an organism, you need to chop it up into smaller pieces first. The smaller pieces are sequenced and then put back in order to give the sequence of the whole genome.4) The Human Genome Project, which was completed in 2003, mapped the entire sequence of the human genome for the first time.Sequencing the Genome of Simple Organisms Helps Identify their Proteins1) The proteome of an organism is all the proteins that are made by it.2) You might remember from Topic 4 that while some parts of the genome code for specific proteins, some parts don't code for anything at all (the DNA is non-coding).3) Simple organisms, such as bacteria, don't have much non-coding DNA.4) This means it is relatively easy to determine their proteome from the DNA sequence of their genome.5) This can be useful in medical research and development. For example, identifying the protein antigens on thesurface of disease-causing bacteria and viruses can help in the development of vaccines to prevent the disease.N. meningitidis group B bacteria cause meningitis B. Sequencing the genome of these bacteria helped researchers identify antigens for use in developing a vaccine against the disease.Remember: vaccines contain antigens that cause your body to produce memory cells. If you're later infected by a pathogen with - the same antigens, your memory cells will quickly recognise it and divide to produce antibodies against it \u2014 so you don't get sick.Example:It\u2019s Harder to Translate the Genome of Complex Organisms1) More complex organisms contain large sections of non-coding DNA.2) They also contain complex regulatory genes, which determine when the genes that code for particular proteins should be switched on and off.3) This makes it more difficult to translate their genome into their proteome, because it's hard to find the bits that code for proteins among thenon-coding and regulatory DNA.

The codes for sure she didn't needmore than 30 000 human proteins have been identified so far. any more sequin-cing.Sequencing Methods are Continuously Updated1) In the past, many sequencing methods were labour-intensive, expensive and could only be done on a small scale.2) Now these techniques are often automated, more cost-effective and can be done on a large scale.3) For example, pyrosequencing is a recently developed technique that can sequence around400 million bases in a ten hour period (which is super fast compared to older techniques).4) With newer, faster techniques such as pyrosequencing available, scientists can now sequence whole genomes much more quickly.Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n","64":"797Genome Projects and Making DNA FragmentsRecombinant DNA Technology Involves Transferring Fragments of DNA1) Recombinant DNA technology involves transferring a fragment of DNA from one organism to another.2) Because the genetic code is universal (the same DNA base triplets code for the same amino acids in all living things), and because transcription and translation mechanisms are pretty similar too, the transferred DNA can be used to produce a protein in the cells of the recipient organism. The recipient and donor organisms don't even have to be from the same species. This can be pretty useful \u2014 see page 201. Organisms that contain transferred DNA are known as transgenic organisms.DNA Fragments Can Be Made in Different WaysIn order to transfer a gene from one organism to another, you first need to get a DNA fragment containing the gene you're interested in (the target gene). There are three ways that DNA fragments can be produced:(V ) Using Reverse Transcriptase1) Most cells only contain two copies of each gene, making it difficult to obtain a DNA fragment containing the target gene. But they can contain many mRNA molecules which are complementary to the gene, so mRNA is often easier to obtain.2) The mRNA molecules can be used as templates to make lots of DNA.The enzyme, reverse transcriptase, makes DNA from an RNA template.The DNA produced is called complementary DNA (cDNA).3) For example, pancreatic cells produce the protein insulin. They have loads of mRNA molecules complementary to the insulin gene, but only two copies of the gene itself. So reverse transcriptase could be used to make cDNA from the insulin mRNA.4) To do this, mRNA is first isolated from cells. Then it's mixed with free DNA nucleotides and reverse transcriptase. The reverse transcriptase uses the mRNA as a template to synthesise a new strand of cDNA.You should remember *from Topic 4 that DNA is copied into mRNA during transcription.DNA sequence\u201ci\u2014rTATGCA A U A C G U U_l__I__I__L_J_____I...complementary mRNA sequence\n(? ) Using Restriction Endonuclease Enzymespalindromic sequenceReads- GAATTOC G G C\u201ci\u2014iT TA Arecognition sequence Tfragment you want^ restriction enzyme added (EcoRI)1) Some sections of DNA have palindromic sequences of nucleotides.These sequences consist of antiparallel base pairs (base pairs that read the same in opposite directions). Reads: gaattc2) Restriction endonucleases arc enzymes that recognise specific palindromic sequences (known as recognition sequences) and cut (digest) the DNA at these places.3) Different restriction endonucleases cut at different specific recognition sequences, because the shape of the recognition sequence is complementary to the enzyme's active site.E.g. the restriction endonuclease EcoR\\ cuts at GAATTC, but Hind\\\\\\ cuts at AAGCTT.4) If recognition sequences are present at either side of the DNA fragment you want, you can use restriction endonucleases to separate it from the rest of the DNA.5) The DNA sample is incubated with the specific restriction endonuclease, which cuts the DNA fragment out via a hydrolysis reaction.6) Sometimes the cut leaves sticky ends g- \u2014 small tails of unpaired bases at each end of the fragment. Sticky ends can be used to bind (anneal) the DNA fragment to another piece of DNA that has sticky ends with complementary sequences (there's more about this on p. 199).double-strandedDNArecognition sequenceDNA\nG\\A A T T C G C \\f \" T* \"a \u2019 A\"*G Ci \\i i i i * i i \\EcoRI cuts hereT G A C-i\u2014i\u2014r*A A \u2022 GEcoRI cuts hereC\\TA Arrsticky endDNAfragment you wantsticky endTopic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n","65":"199Amplifying DNA FragmentsOnce you've got your teeny tiny fragment of DNA, you need to amplify it so you've got lots and lots to play with...In Vivo Amplification Involves Transforming Host CellsOnce you've isolated your DNA fragment (using one of the techniques on pages 197-198) you need to amplify it (make lots of copies of it) so you have a sufficient quantity to work with. One way of doing this is to use in vivo cloning \u2014 this is where copies of the DNA fragment are made inside a living organism.Step 1 \u2014 The DNA Fragment is Inserted into a Vector1) The DNA fragment is inserted into vector DNA \u2014 ~r-. . . , , , , , , , Vectora vector is something that's used to transfer DNA \u00a9 tagcttaagcta DNAinto a cell.

This process is called ligation.4) The new combination of bases in the DNA (vector DNA + DNA fragment) is called recombinant DNA.Step 2 \u2014 The Vector Transfers the DNA Fragment into Host Cells1) The vector with the recombinant DNA is used to transfer the gene into cells (called host cells).2) If a plasmid vector is used, host cells have to be persuaded to take in the plasmid vector and its DNA.E.g. host bacterial cells are placed into ice-cold calcium chloride solution to make their cell walls more permeable. The plasmids are added and the mixture is heat-shocked (heated to around 42 \u00b0C for 1-2 minutes), which encourages the cells to take in the plasmids.3) With a bacteriophage vector, the bacteriophage will infect the host bacterium by injecting its DNA into it. The phage DNA (with the target gene in it) then integrates into the bacterial DNA.4) Host cells that take up the vectors containing the gene of interest are said to be transformed.Step 3 \u2014 Identifying Transformed Host CellsOnly around 5% of host cells will take up the vector and its DNA, so it's important to be able to identify which cells have been transformed. Marker genes can be used to identify the transformed cells:1) Marker genes can be inserted into vectors at the same time as the gene to be cloned.This means any transformed host cells will contain the gene to be cloned and the marker gene.2) Host cells are grown on agar plates. Each cell divides and replicates its DNA, creating a colony of cloned cells. Transformed cells will produce colonies where all the cells contain the cloned gene and the marker gene.3) The marker gene can code for antibiotic resistance \u2014 host cells are grown on agar plates containing the specific antibiotic, so only transformed cells that have the marker gene will survive and grow. Or it can code for fluorescence \u2014 when the agar plate is placed under a UV light only transformed cells will fluoresce.4) Identified transformed cells are allowed to grow more, producing lots and lots of copies of the cloned gene.To Produce Proteins You Need Promoter and Terminator Regions1) If you want the transformed host cells to produce the protein coded for by the DNA fragment,you need to make sure that the vector contains specific promoter and terminator regions.2) Promoter regions are DNA sequences that tell the enzyme RNA polymerase when to start producing mRNA. Terminator regions tell it when to stop. Without the right promoter region, the DNA fragment won't be transcribed by the host cell and a protein won't be made.3) Promoter and terminator regions may be present in the vector DNA or they may have to be added in along with the fragment.Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n","66":"77Enzyme Action...but the Induced Fit\u2019 Model is a Better TheoryThe 'induced fit' model helps to explain why enzymes are so specific and only bond to one particular substrate.The substrate doesn't only have to be the right shape to fit the active site, it has to make the active site change shape in the right way as well. This is a prime example of how a widely accepted theory can change when new evidence comes along. The 'induced fit' model is still widely accepted \u2014 for now, anyway.\nenzymeas the substrate binds the active site changes shape slightly.productsXsubstrateenzyme-substratecomplexThe \u2018Luminous Tights\u2019 model was popular in the 1980s but has since been found to be grossly inappropriate.Enzyme Properties Relate to Their Tertiary Structure1) Enzymes are very specific \u2014 they usually only catalyse one reaction, e.g. maltase only breaks down maltose, sucrase only breaks down sucrose.2) This is because only one complementary substrate will fit into the active site.3) The active site's shape is determined by the enzyme's tertiary structure (which is determined by the enzyme's primary structure).4) Each different enzyme has a different tertiary structure and so a different shaped active site.If the substrate shape doesn't match the active site, an enzyme-substrate complex won't be formed and the reaction won't be catalysed.5) If the tertiary structure of the enzyme is altered in any way, the shape of the active site will change. This means the substrate won't fit into the active site, an enzyme-substrate complex won't be formed and the enzyme will no longer be able to carry out its function.6) The tertiary structure of an enzyme may be altered by changes in pH or temperature (see next page).7) The primary structure (amino acid sequence) of a protein is determined by a gene. If a mutation occurs in that gene (see p. 91), it could change the tertiary structure of the enzyme produced.Practice QuestionsQ1 What is an enzyme?Q2 What is the name given to the amount of energy needed to start a reaction?Q3 What is an enzyme-substrate complex?Q4 Why can an enzyme only bind to one substance?[4 marks] [2 marks]Exam QuestionsQ1 Dcscribc the \u2018induced fit\u2019 model of enzyme action.Q2 Explain how a change in the amino acid sequence of an enzyme may prevent it from functioning properly.But why is the enzyme-substrate complex?So enzymes lower the activation energy of a reaction.

Mwah ha hah.Transformed Organisms Are Made Using Recombinant DNA Technology1) Microorganisms, plants and animals can all be transformed using recombinant DNA technology. This is called genetic engineering.2) Transformed microorganisms can be made using the same technology as in vivo cloning (see page 199). For example, foreign DNA can be inserted into microorganisms to produce lots of useful protein, e.g. insulin:jvM \/1 \" 1 I I \" , , , , , , , , I , 1 , # ( !

The plasmid is added to a bacterium and the bacterium is used as a vector to get the gene into the plant cells.If the right promoter region has been added along with the gene (see p. 199), the transformed cells will be able to produce the desired protein.Transformed animals can be produced too \u2014 a gene that codes for a desirable protein can be inserted into an early animal embryo or into the egg cells of a female. If the gene is inserted into a very early embryo, all the body cells of the resulting transformed animal will end up containing the gene. Inserting it into the egg cells means that when the female reproduces, all the cells of her offspring will contain the gene.Promoter regions that are only activated in specific cell types can be used to control exactly which of an animal's body cells the protein is produced in. If the protein is only produced in certain cells, it can be harvested more easily. Producing the protein in the wrong cells could also damage the organism.Recombinant DNA Technology Can be Used to Benefit HumansTransformed organisms (microorganisms, plants and animals) can be used in a variety of ways. You need to be able to interpret information about how they are used. Here are some examples:AgricultureAgricultural crops can be transformed so that they give higher yields or are more nutritious. This means these plants can be used to reduce the risk of famine and malnutrition. Crops can also be transformed to have pest resistance, so that fewer pesticides are needed. This reduces costs and reduces any environmental problems associated with using pesticides.For example, Golden Rice is a variety of transformed rice. It contains one gene from a maize plant and one gene from a soil bacterium, which together enable the rice to produce beta-carotene. The beta-carotene is used by our bodies to produce vitamin A. Golden Rice is being developed to reduce vitamin A deficiency in areas where there's a shortage of dietary vitamin A, e.g. south Asia, Africa. Vitamin A deficiency is a big problem in these areas, e.g. up to 500 000 children per year worldwide go blind due to vitamin A deficiency.IndustryIndustrial processes often use biological catalysts (enzymes). These enzymes can be produced from transformed organisms, so they can be produced in large quantities for less money, reducing costs.For example, chymosin (or rennin) is an enzyme used in cheese-making. It used to be made from rennet (a substance produced in the stomach of cows), but it can now be produced by transformed organisms. This means it can be made in large quantities, relatively cheaply and without killing any cows, making some cheese suitable for vegetarians.MedicineMany drugs and vaccines are produced by transformed organisms, using recombinant DNA technology. They can be made quickly, cheaply and in large quantities using this method.For example, insulin is used to treat Type 1 diabetes and used to come from animals (cow, horse or pig pancreases). This insulin wasn't human insulin though, so it didn't work quite as well. Human insulin is now made from transformed microorganisms, using a cloned human insulin gene (see above).Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n","68":"202Using Recombinant DNA TechnologyThere are Concerns About the Use of Recombinant DNA Technology...There are ethical, financial and social issues associated with the use of recombinant DNA technology:AgricultureFarmers might plant only one type of transformed crop (this is called monoculture). This could make the whole crop vulnerable to the same disease because the plants are genetically identical. Environmentalists are also concerned about monocultures reducing biodiversity, as this could damage the environment.Some people are concerned about the possibility of 'superweeds' \u2014 weeds that are resistant to herbicides. These could occur if transformed crops interbreed with wild plants. There could then be an uncontrolled spread of recombinant DNA, with unknown consequences.Organic farmers can have their crops contaminated by wind-blown seeds from nearby genetically modified crops. This means they can't sell their crop as organic and may lose their income.IndustryAnti-globalisation activists oppose globalisation (e.g. the growth of large multinational companies at the expense of smaller ones). A few, large biotechnology companies control some forms of genetic engineering. As the use of this technology increases, these companies get bigger and more powerful. This may force smaller companies out of business, e.g. by making it harder for them to compete. Without proper labelling, some people think they won't have a choice about whether to consume food made using genetically engineered organisms.Some consumer markets, such as the EU, won't import GM foods and products. This can cause an economic loss to producers who have traditionally sold to those markets.MedicineCompanies who own genetic engineering technologies may limit the use of technologies that could be saving lives.Some people worry this technology could be used unethically, e.g. to make designer babies (babies that have characteristics chosen by their parents). This is currently illegal though.Recombinant DNA technology also creates ownership issues. Here are some examples:\u2022 There is some debate about who owns genetic material from humans once it has been removed from the body \u2014 the donor or the researcher. Some people argue that the individual holds the right to their own genetic information, however others argue that value is created by the researcher who uses it to develop a medicine or in diagnosis.\u2022 A small number of large corporations own patents to particular seeds. They can charge high prices, sometimes including a 'technology fee', and can require farmers to repurchase seeds each year.If non-GM crops are contaminated by GM crops, farmers can be sued for breaching the patent law....But Humanitarians Think it will Benefit PeopleRecombinant DNA technology has many potential humanitarian benefits:1) Agricultural crops could be produced that help reduce the risk of famine and malnutrition, e.g. drought-resistant crops for drought-prone areas.2) Transformed crops could be used to produce useful pharmaceutical products (e.g. vaccines) which could make drugs available to more people, e.g. in areas where refrigeration (usually needed for storing vaccines) isn't available.3) Mcdicines could be produced more chcaply, so more people can afford them.4) Recombinant DNA technology has the potential to be used in gene therapy to treat human diseases (see next page).>0U need to be able z- to balance the humanitarian : r h\/neflts opposing views =- from environmentalists and ~ S ant|-9|obalisat,on activists r(see above) -Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n","69":"204Gene Probes and Medical DiagnosisBeing able to manipulate DNA is also really useful for diagnosing medical problems.You can Look for Alleles Using DNA Probes and Hybridisation-r-PC GG C -i , i__probeT TDNA^1) DNA probes can be used to locate specific alleles of genes (e.g. on chromosomes) or to see if a person's DNA contains a mutated allele that causes a genetic disorder.2) DNA probes are short strands of DNA. They have a specific base sequence t athat's complementary to the base sequence of part of a target allele (the allele you're looking for, e.g. an allele that causes a genetic disorder).3) This means a DNA probe will bind (hybridise) to the target allele if it's present in a sample of DNA.4) A DNA probe also has a label attached, so that it can be detected. The two most common types of label are a radioactive label (detected using X-ray film) or a fluorescent label (detected using UV light)5) Here's how it's done:A A j____i...\nA sample of DNA is digested into fragments using restriction enzymes (see p. 197) and separated using electrophoresis (see p. 206).The separated DNA fragments are then transferred to a nylon membrane and incubated with the fluorescently labelled DNA probe.If the allele is present, the DNA probe will hybridise (bind) to it.The membrane is then exposed to UV light and if the gene is present there will be a fluorescent band. E.g. sample 3 has a visible band, so this patient has the allele6) Alternatively, the probe can be used as part of a DNA microarray, which can screen lots of genes at the same time:A DNA microarray is a glass slide with microscopic spots of different DNA probes attached to it in rows.A sample of fluorescently labelled human DNA is washed over the array.If the labelled human DNA contains any DNA sequences that match any of the probes, it will stick to the array. The array is washed, to remove any labelled DNA that hasn't stuck to it.The array is then visualised underUV light \u2014 any labelled DNA attachedto a probe will show up (fluoresce).Any spot that fluoresces means that the person's DNA contains that specific allele.

Whereas a website \ndesigner could operate from home very e ff ectively, as \ncommunication with customers will be by electronic \nmeans, a hairdresser may need to consider obtaining \npremises in an area with the biggest number of potential \ncustomers. An alternative is to visit customers in their own \nhomes \u00a0\u2013 this way, the entrepreneur may avoid the costs of \nbuying or renting their own premises altogether.\nCompetition\nTh is is nearly always a problem for new enterprises unless \nthe business idea is so unique that no other business has \nanything quite like it. A newly created business will o ft en \nexperience competition from older, established businesses, \nwith more resources and more market knowledge. Th e \nentrepreneur may have to o ff er better customer service \nto overcome the cost and pricing advantages that bigger \nbusinesses can usually o ff er.\nBuilding a customer base\nTh is is linked to the previous point about competition. To \nsurvive, a new fi rm must establish itself in the market \u00a0and \nbuild up customer numbers as quickly as possible. Th e  l o n g -\nterm strength of the business will depend on encouraging \ncustomers to return to purchase products again and again. \nMany small businesses try to encourage this by o ff ering \na better service than their larger and better-funded \ncompetitors.

In fact, many businesses fail during their \nfi rst year of operation. Th e most common reasons for \nnew enterprises failing are:demand for their product to allow the business to be \nprofi table. Th e original idea for most new businesses \ncomes from one of several sources including:\n\u25a0 O w n  s k i l l s  o r  h o b b i e s \u00a0\u2013 e.g. dress-making or car \nbodywork repairing. Very o ft en, these skills will enable an \nentrepreneur to o ff er them to friends and relatives and this \ncould be the start of the business.\n\u25a0 P r e v i o u s  e m p l o y m e n t  e x p e r i e n c e \u00a0\u2013 working for a \nsuccessful hairdresser, for example, allows a potential \nentrepreneur to see the working of such a business \nand judge whether they could set up a similar business \nthemselves.\n\u25a0 F r a n c h i s i n g  c o n f e r e n c e s  and exhibitions \u00a0\u2013 these o ff er a \nwide range of new business start-up ideas, e.g. fast-food \nrestaurants, which also give the potential benefits of the \nsupport of a much larger franchiser business.\n\u25a0 Small-budget market research \u00a0\u2013 the Internet allows any \nuser to browse business directories to see how many \nbusinesses there are in the local area o ff ering certain \ngoods or services. Such small-scale research might indicate \ngaps in local markets that could be profitably filled by the \nentrepreneur.\nSourcing capital (finance)\nOnce the entrepreneur has decided on the business idea \nor opportunity, the next task is to raise the necessary \ncapital. In an International Labour Organization survey \nof new business start-ups, the problem of fi nance came \ntop of the list of replies from entrepreneurs regarding the \nmain di ffi  culty. So why is obtaining fi nance such a major \nproblem for entrepreneurs?\n\u25a0 L a c k  o f  s u ff i c i en t  o w n  fi n a nc e \u00a0\u2013 many entrepreneurs have \nvery limited personal savings, especially if they are setting \nup their own business because they were previously made \nredundant.\n\u25a0 L a c k  o f  a w a r e n e s s  o f  t h e  f i n a n c i a l  s u p p o r t  a n d  g r a n t s  \navailable.\n\u25a0 Lack of any trading record to present to banks as evidence \nof past business success \u00a0\u2013 a trading record would tend to \ngive a bank confidence when deciding to lend money or not \nfor a new venture.\n\u25a0 A poorly produced business plan that fails to convince \npotential investors of the chances of a business\u2019s success.\nDetermining a location\nPerhaps the most important consideration when \nchoosing the location for a new business is the need to \nminimise fi xed costs. When fi nance is limited, it is very \nimportant to try to keep the break-even level of output \u00a0\u2013 \nthe output level that earns enough revenue to cover all \ncosts \u00a0\u2013 as low as possible.

Operating from home is \nthe most common way for entrepreneurs to establish their 8Cambridge International AS and A Level Business","72":"Lack of record keeping\nTh e lack of accurate records is a big reason for business \nfailure. Many entrepreneurs fail to pay su ffi  cient attention \nto this need as either they believe that it is less important \nthan meeting their customers\u2019 needs, or they think \nthey can remember everything. Th e latter will be quite \nimpossible a ft er a period of time. How can the owner of a \nnew, busy fl orist shop remember:\n\u25a0 w h e n  t h e  n e x t  d e l i v e r y  o f  f r e s h  f l o w e r s  i s  d u e ?\n\u25a0 whether the flowers for last week\u2019s big wedding have been \npaid for?\n\u25a0 if the cheque received from the government department \nfor the display of flowers in its reception area has been paid \ninto the bank yet?\n\u25a0 how many hours the shop assistant worked last week?\nTh ere are many other examples that could be given to \nillustrate the crucial importance of keeping accurate and up-\nto-date records of business transactions and other matters.\nWith the falling cost of computing power, most \nbusinesses, even newly formed ones, keep records on \ncomputer. It is always advisable to keep hold of paper \nrecords too \u00a0\u2013 when these exist \u00a0\u2013 for example, receipts from \nsuppliers or details of big deliveries. Not only can these act \nas a check or back-up system if the computer should fail, but \nthey can also provide evidence to the tax authorities if they \ndispute the entrepreneur\u2019s own tax calculations.\nLack of cash and working capital\nRunning short of capital to run day-to-day business \naff airs is the single most common reason for the failure \nof new businesses to survive the fi rst year of operation.\nCapital is needed for day-to-day cash, for the holding \nof inventories and to allow the giving of trade credit to \ncustomers, who then become trade receivables. Without \nsuffi  cient working capital, the business may be unable \nto buy more supplies, or pay suppliers o ff er credit to \nimportant customers. All these factors could lead to \nthe\u00a0business closing down.\nSerious working capital de fi ciencies can usually be \navoided if several simple, but important, steps are taken \nas\u00a0the business is being established:\n\u25a0 Construct a cash flow forecast so that the liquidity and \nworking capital needs of the business can be assessed \nmonth by month.

Some learn \nthese skills very quickly once the business is operating, \nbut this is quite a risky strategy. Some organisations \nexist to provide support for new entrepreneurs in the \nform of advice and training. Some entrepreneurs \u2018buy \nin\u2019 experience by employing sta ff  with management \nexperience, but how many newly formed businesses can \naff ord this expensive option?\nIt is wrong to think, just because a business is new and \nsmall, that enthusiasm, a strong personality and hard work \nwill be su ffi  cient to ensure success. Th is may prove to be \nthe case, but o ft en it is not. So potential entrepreneurs \nare usually encouraged to attend training courses to gain \nsome of these skills before putting their hard-earned \ncapital at risk, or to fi rst seek management experience \nthrough employment.\nThe section above introduces some of the important \nfunctions of and skills required by good managers, \nsuggesting why the key concept of management  is so \nimportant.\nKEY CONCEPT LINK\nChanges in the business environment\nSetting up a new business is risky because the business \nenvironment is dynamic, or constantly changing. In \naddition to the problems and challenges referred to above, \nthere is also the risk of change, which can make the \noriginal business idea much less successful. Change is a \nkey feature of Business syllabuses and, therefore, of this \nbook \u00a0\u2013 indeed there is a whole section on change in Unit \u00a06, \nChapter 40 . It is enough to observe at this stage that new \nbusinesses may fail if any of the following changes occur, 91: Enterprise ","73":"\u25a0 Rising incomes associated with higher living standards \nhave led consumers to spend much of their extra income \non services rather than more goods. There has been \nsubstantial growth in tourism, hotels and restaurant \nservices, financial services and so on \u00a0\u2013 yet spending on \nphysical goods is rising more slowly.\n\u25a0 As the rest of the world industrialises, so manufacturing \nbusinesses in developed countries face much more \ncompetition and these rivals tend to be more e ff i c i en t  a nd \nuse cheaper labour. Therefore, rising imports of goods are \ntaking the market away from the domestic secondary-\nsector firms.\n3 The importance of each sector varies significantly \nbetween di ff erent economies. Table 2.1  gives details of the \ndiff erences that exist between three di ff erent countries\u2019 \neconomies and the share of total employment accounted \nfor by each sector of industry.\nPublic and private sectors\nIndustry may also be classi fi ed in other ways, for example by \npublic  or private sector  and by type of legal organisation. \nAs we shall see, these two types of classi fi cation are \ninterlinked, as some types of legal structure are found only \nin the private sector. What is the di ff erence between the \nprivate sector and public sector of the economy?\nPublic sector: comprises organisations accountable \nto and controlled by central or local government \n(the state).\nPrivate sector: comprises businesses owned and \ncontrolled by individuals or groups of individuals.\nKEY TERMS\nIn nearly every country with a mixed economy , most \nbusiness activity is in the private sector. Th e  r e l a t i v e  \nimportance of the private sector compared to the \npublic sector is not the same in all countries. Th o s e  \neconomies that are closest to a free-market  system have \nvery small public sectors. Th ose countries with central \nplanning command economies  will have very few \nbusinesses in the private sector.Command economy: economic resources are owned, \nplanned and controlled by the state.\nKEY TERM\nTh e types and sizes of businesses in the private sector can \nvary considerably. Th e  l e g a l  o r g a n i s a t i o n  o f  fi rms in the \nprivate sector is covered below. In most mixed-economy \ncountries, certain important goods and services are provided \nby state-run organisations as it is argued that they are too \nsigni fi cant to be le ft  to private businesses. Th e s e  u s u a l l y  \ninclude health and education services, defence and public \nlaw and order (police force). In some countries, important \nstrategic industries are also owned and controlled by the \nstate, such as energy, telecommunications and public \ntransport. In recent years, there has been a trend towards \nselling these o ff  to the private sector \u00a0\u2013 privatisation \u00a0\u2013 and the \nimpact of this policy is analysed on page  67.\nAnother re ason for the state or public sector to provide \ngoods or services rather than the private sector is the \nexistence of what economists call \u2018public goods\u2019. Th e s e  \nare goods and services that cannot be charged for, so it is \nimpossible for a private-sector business to make a pro fi t \nfrom producing them. A good example is street lighting. It \nis impossible to exclude people from obtaining the bene fi t \nof the streetlights if they have not contributed to paying for \nthem \u00a0\u2013 so why should anyone contribute directly towards \npaying for them? Th is means that taxes will have to be used \nto raise revenue to pay for a street-lighting system and this \nmeans that it can be provided only by the public sector.\nThe legal structure of business \norganisations \u00a0\u2013 the private sector\nFigure 2.1 on the next page shows the main types of \nprivate sector business.\nSole trader\nTh is is the most common form of business organisation. \nAlthough there is a single owner in this business \norganisation, it is common for sole traders  to employ \nothers, but the fi rm is likely to remain very small. \nBecause of this, although they are great in number, \nsole traders account for only a small proportion of \ntotal business turnover.

Th is can discourage \nsome potential entrepreneurs from starting a business. \nAnother signi fi cant problem is fi nance for expansion. \nMany sole traders remain small because the owner \nwishes to remain in control of their own business, \nbut another reason is the limitations that they have \nin raising additional capital. As soon as partners or \nshareholders are sought in order to raise fi nance, then \nthe sole trader becomes another form of organisation \naltogether.

Th ese are:\n1 Limited liability\nTh e ownership of companies is divided into small \nunits called shares. People can buy these and become \nshareholders \u00a0\u2013 part owners of the business. It is possible to \nbuy just one share, but usually these are owned in blocks, \nand it is possible for one person or organisation to have \ncomplete control by owning more than 50% of the shares. \nIndividuals with large blocks of shares o ft en become \ndirectors of the business. All shareholders bene fi t from the \nadvantage of limited liability .\nLimited liability: the only liability \u00a0\u2013 or potential loss \u00a0\u2013 a \nshareholder has if the company fails is the amount invested \nin the company, not the total wealth of the shareholder.\nKEY TERM\nNobody can make any further claim against shareholders, \nshould the company fail. Th is has two important e ff ects:\n\u25a0 People are prepared to provide finance to enable \ncompanies to expand.\n\u25a0 The greater risk of the company failing to pay its debts \nis now transferred from investors to creditors (those \nsuppliers\/lenders who have not been paid). Creditors, \nas a result, are very interested in both checking whether \nthe word \u2018limited\u2019 appears in the business name and scrutinising the company\u2019s accounts for signs of potential \nfuture weakness.\n2 Legal personality\nA company is recognised in law as having a legal \nidentity separate from that of its owners. Th is means, for \nexample, that if the foods sold by a company are found \nto be dangerous or contaminated, the company itself can \nbe taken to court \u00a0\u2013 not the owners, as would be the case \nwith either a sole trader or a partnership. A company can \nbe sued and can itself sue through the courts. Th i s  d o e s  \nnot take all legal responsibilities away from the managers \nand owners. For example, directors can be legally \nresponsible if they knowingly continue trading when \ntheir company is illiquid. Th e y  m u s t  s t i l l  a c t  r e s p o n s i b l y  \nand in accordance with the stated aims of the business \nand within the law.\n3 Continuity\nIn a company, the death of an owner or director \ndoes not lead to its break-up or dissolution. All that \nhappens is that ownership continues through the \ninheritance of the shares, and there is no break in \nownership at all.\nPrivate limited companies\nTh e protection that comes from forming a company is, \ntherefore, substantial. Small fi rms can gain this protection \nwhen the owner(s) create a private limited company .\nPrivate limited company: a small to medium-sized \nbusiness that is owned by shareholders who are o ft en \nmembers of the same family; this company cannot sell \nshares to the general public.\nKEY TERMAdvantages Disadvantages\n\u25a0 partners may specialise in di ff erent areas of business \nmanagement\n\u25a0 shared decision-making\n\u25a0 additional capital injected by each partner\n\u25a0 business losses shared between the partners\n\u25a0 greater privacy and fewer legal formalities than corporate \norganisations (companies)\u25a0 unlimited liability for all partners (with some exceptions)\n\u25a0 profits are shared\n\u25a0 as with sole traders, no continuity and the partnership will \nhave to be reformed in the event of the death of one of the \npartners\n\u25a0 all partners bound by the decisions of any one of them\n\u25a0 not possible to raise capital from selling shares\n\u25a0 a sole trader, taking on partners, will lose independence of \ndecision-making\nTable 2.3 Advantages and disadvantages of partnerships\n192: Business structure ","76":"Th e word \u2018Limited\u2019 or \u2018Ltd\u2019 (\u2018Pte\u2019 in some countries) \ntells us that the business has this legal form.

Th is not only means that public limited companies can raise potentially very large sums \nfrom public issues of shares, but existing shareholders \nmay also quickly sell their shares if they wish to. Th i s  \nfl exibility of share buying and selling encourages the \npublic to purchase the shares in the fi rst instance and \nthus invest in the business. Th e  o t h e r  m a i n  d i ff erence \nbetween private and public companies concerns the \n\u2018divorce between ownership and control\u2019. As was \nexplained above, the original owners of the business \nare usually still able to retain a majority of shares \nand continue to exercise management control when it \nconverts to private company status. Th is is most unlikely \nwith public limited companies, due to the sheer volume \nof shares issued and number of people and institutions \nas investors. Th ese shareholders own the company, but \nthey appoint, at the annual general meeting, a board of \ndirectors who control the management and decision-\nmaking of the business.\nTh is clear distinction between ownership and control \ncan lead to con fl icts, for example over the objectives to \nbe set and direction to be taken by the business. Th e \nshareholders might prefer measures that aim at short-\nterm pro fi ts, whereas the directors may decide to aim for \nlong-term growth of the business, perhaps in order to \nincrease their own power and status. Many private limited \ncompanies convert to plc status for the reasons given in \nTable \u00a02.5 on page  22. It is possible for the directors or the \noriginal owners of a business to convert it back from a \nplc to private limited company status: Richard Branson \nand the Virgin group is one of the best-known examples. \nTh e reasons for doing this are largely to overcome the \ndivorce between ownership and control \u00a0\u2013 in a private \nlimited company, it is normal for the senior executives \nto be the major, majority shareholders. In addition, the \nowner of a private limited company can take a long-term \nplanning view of the business.

Humans need things like money and the newest mobile phone, but enzymes are quite content with the right temperature and pH.Temperature has a Big Influence on Enzyme ActivityLike any chemical reaction, the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction increases when the temperature's increased. More heat means more kinetic energy, so molecules move faster. This makes the enzymes more likely to collide with the substrate molecules. The energy of these collisions also increases, which means each collision is more likely to result in a reaction. But, if the temperature gets too high, the reaction stops.1) The rise in temperature makes the enzyme's molecules vibrate more.2) If the temperature goes above a certain level, this vibration breaks some of the bonds that hold the enzyme in shape.3) The active site changes shape and the enzyme and substrate no longer fit together.4) At this point, the enzyme is denatured\u2014 it no longer functions as a catalyst.optimum temperature11 nn 11,TemperaturepH Also Affects Enzyme ActivityO\u2019\" \" I M I | | | ,, , ,~ Every enzyme has an enzyme is r optimum temperature = denatured r For most human enzymes - r ,t,saro^37\u00b0C but some r _ enzymes, like those used in ~- biological washing powders, ~ ~ can work well at 60 \u00b0C ~All enzymes have an optimum pH value.

Above and below the optimum pH, the H+ and OH ions found in acids and alkalis can mess up the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds that hold the enzyme's tertiary structure in place. This makes the active site change shape, so the enzyme is denatured.Enzyme Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction1) The more enzyme molecules there are in a solution,the more likely a substrate molecule is to collide with one and form an enzyme-substrate complex. So increasing the concentration of the enzyme increases the rate of reaction.2) But, if the amount of substrate is limited, there comes a point when there's more than enough enzyme molecules to deal with all the available substrate, so adding more enzyme has no further effect.steady increase as more active sites are available \\if substrate amount is limited, an increase in enzyme concentration eventually has no further effectEnzyme ConcentrationSubstrate Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction Up to a Pointsteady increase as more substrate molecules are availableall active sites used \u2014 increase in substrate concentration has no further effectSubstrate Concentration1) The higher the substrate concentration, the faster the reaction \u2014 more substrate molecules means a collision between substrate and enzyme is more likely and so more active sites will be used. This is only true up until a 'saturation' point though. After that, there are so many substrate molecules that the enzymes have about as much as they can cope with(all the active sites are full), and adding more makes no difference.2) Substrate concentration decreases with time during a reaction (unless more substrate is added to the reaction mixture), so if no other variables are changed, the rate of reaction will decrease over time too. This makes the initial rate of reaction (the reaction rate at the start) the highest rate of reaction.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","78":"This chapter covers syllabus \nsection AS Level 1.3.\nTALE OF TWO INDUSTRIES\nThe size of the average Indian steel plant \ncompared to the size of the average Indian \nretail shop could not be more di ff erent. \nSteel plants employ thousands of workers, \nhave millions of dollars of capital invested \nin advanced equipment and produce \nannual output valued in the millions too. \nTata, one of the largest steel makers in the \nworld, has recently grown by taking over \nEuropean steel giant Corus. The contrast \nwith typical Indian retail outlets could not \nbe greater. The small shopkeepers and \nstreet hawkers that presently account \nfor more than 95% of Indian retail sales \noft en employ just a few workers with \nlittle investment in modern technology. \nHowever, all this could be about to change. \nThere is a growing trend of mergers and takeovers in \nthe retail sector. Large retail groups, such as Reliance \nand Walmart, are becoming established. It is claimed \nthat the market share of this organised sector will be \n28% by 2017. A pressure group of small retailers, the \nNational Movement for Retail Democracy, is organising \ndemonstrations to demand that big corporations leave \nthe retail industry.Points to think about:\n\u25a0 Why do you think the average steel plant is much larger \nthan the average shop?\n\u25a0 H o w  c o u l d  y o u  c o m p a r e  t h e  s i z e s  o f  d i ff erent businesses?\n\u25a0 Do you think consumers of steel, such as car makers, will \nbenefit from a takeover of Corus by Tata?\n\u25a0 Do you think Indian consumers will benefit from \nincreasing numbers of large retail shops owned by just a \nfew large corporations?\nIntroduction\nBusinesses vary in size from sole traders with no \nadditional workers to huge multinational corporations \nemploying hundreds of thousands of employees. \nMeasuring the size of businesses is a rather inexact \nscience, but e ff orts are still made so that comparisons can \nbe made between them, and so that growth or contraction \ncan be assessed over time.

Who \nwants to know how large a particular business is? Th e \ngovernment might wish to give assistance to \u2018small\u2019 \nfi rms, so will need a measure of size. Investors in a fi rm \nmay wish to compare the size of the business with close \ncompetitors \u00a0\u2013 particularly in order to compare the rate \nof growth. Customers may prefer to deal only with large \nfi rms, assuming, perhaps, that they are more stable and \nless likely to cease production than smaller ones. Th e r e  a r e  \ntwo problems with these and other requirements for a way \nof measuring business size:\n1 T h e r e  a r e  s e v e r a l  d i ff erent ways of measuring and \ncomparing business size and they o ft en giv e di ff erent \ncomparative results. A firm might appear large by one \nmeasure but quite small by another.\n2 There is no internationally agreed definition of what a small, \nmedium or large business is, but the number of employees \nis oft en  used  to mak e  this distinction.\nDiff e r e n t  m e a s u r e s  o f  s i z e\n1 Number of employees\nTh is is the simplest measure. It is easy to understand \u00a0\u2013 for \nexample, it is obvious to everyone that a shop run by just \nthe owner or their family is small. It is also clear that a \nfi rm employing many sta ff  is likely to be large. However, \nthere are problems. How about a business that needs to \nemploy only a few people \u00a0\u2013 such as a highly automated \ncomputer-chip maker with expensive capital equipment?\nExample:  Th ere are two so ft  drink fi rms in the same \ntown. One uses traditional methods of production, using \n108 people to make 300,000 litres of drink a week. Th e \nother is totally automated and produces one million litres \na week with just ten \u00a0staff .\n2 Revenue\nRevenue  is oft en used as a measure of size \u00a0\u2013 especially \nwhen comparing fi rms in the same industry. It is less \neff ective when comparing fi rms in di ff erent industries \nbecause some might be engaged in \u2018high-value\u2019 \nproduction, such as precious jewels, and another might be \nin \u2018low-value\u2019 production, such as cleaning services. Th i s  \nmeasure is needed to calculate market share.\nRevenue: total value of sales made by a business in a \ngiven time period.\nKEY TERM3 Capital employed\nGenerally, the larger the business enterprise, the greater \nthe value of capital needed for long-term investment, \nor the greater the amount of capital employed . Again, \ncomparisons between fi rms in di ff erent industries may \ngive a rather misleading picture. Two fi rms employing \nthe same number of sta ff  may have very di ff erent capital \nequipment needs, such as a hairdresser and an optician. \nTh e latter will need expensive diagnostic and eyesight-\nmeasuring machines.\nCapital employed: the total value of all long-term finance \ninvested in the business.\nKEY TERM\n4 Market capitalisation\nMarket capitalisation  can be used only for businesses that \nhave shares quoted on the stock exchange (public limited \ncompanies). It is calculated by this formula:\nMarket capitalisation =  current share price \u00d7 \ntotal number of shares issued\nMarket capitalisation: the total value of a company\u2019s \nissued shares.\nKEY TERM\nAs share prices tend to change every day, this form of \ncomparison is not a very stable one. For example, a \ntemporary but sharp drop in the share price of a company \ncould appear to make it much \u2018smaller\u2019 than this measure \nwould normally suggest.\n5 Market share\nMarket share  is a relative measure. If a fi rm has a high \nmarket share, it must be among the leaders in the industry \nand comparatively  large. However, when the size of the total \nmarket is small, a high market share will not indicate a very \nlarge fi rm.

Th e  n u m b e r  \nof guest beds or guest rooms could be used to compare \nhotel businesses. Th e number of shops could be used \nfor retailers. Total fl oor sales space could also be used to \ncompare retail businesses.\nTOP TIP\nProfit is not a good measure of business size \u00a0\u2013 but it can \nbe used to assess business performance.\nWhich form of measurement is best?\nTh ere is no \u2018best\u2019 measure. Th e one used depends on what \nneeds to be established about the fi rms being compared. \nTh is could depend on whether we are interested in absolute \nsize or comparative size within one industry. If an absolute \nmeasure of size is required, then it is almost certainly \nadvisable to test a fi rm on at least two of the above criteria \nand to make comparisons on the basis of these.\nTOP TIP\nIf asked to comment on data showing the sizes of \ndiff erent businesses, do remember that if another \nmeasure were used, the conclusions about relative size \nmight be very di ff erent.\nThe significance of small and \nmicro-businesses\nEven though we have not established a universally agreed \ndefi nition of small fi rms, it will be easy to identify them \nwithin your own economy. Th ey will employ few people \nand will have a low turnover compared to other fi rms. \nTh e  offi  cial de fi nition within your own country could be \ndiscovered from the trade and industry department. It is \nnow common to make a further distinction for very small \nbusinesses known as \u2018micro-enterprises\u2019. Th e  E u r o p e a n  \nUnion de fi nitions are shown in  Table 3.1.Small fi rms (including micro-enterprises) are very \nimportant to all economies and to the industry in which \nthey operate. Encouraging the development of small \nbusiness units can have the following bene fi ts:\n\u25a0 Many jobs are created by small firms and, even though each \none may not employ many sta ff , collectively the small-\nbusiness sector employs a very significant proportion of the \nworking population in most countries.\n\u25a0 S m a l l  b u s i n e s s e s  a r e  o ft en ru n b y dyn amic entrepreneu rs, \nwith new ideas for consumer goods and services. This helps \nto create variety in the market and consumers will benefit \nfrom greater choice.\n\u25a0 Small firms can create competition for larger businesses. \nWithout this competition, larger firms could exploit \nconsumers with high prices and poor service. The cost \nof air travel has been reduced in recent years due to the \nestablishment of many small airlines competing with the \nlarge, established companies.\n\u25a0 Small firms o ft en supply specialist goods and \nservices to important industries in a country. For \nexample, the global car industry is dominated by major \nmanufacturers such as Toyota, BMW and Ford. All of \nthese large businesses depend on small specialist \nsuppliers of on-board computers, high-quality audio \nequipment and headlights. Very o ft en, by being able to \nadapt quickly to the changing needs of large firms, small \nbusinesses actually increase the competitiveness of the \nlarger organisations.\n\u25a0 All great businesses were small at one time. The Body Shop \nbegan in one small rented store in 1976. Hewlett-Packard \nstarted assembling electrical equipment in Packard\u2019s \ngarage! The large firms of the future are the small firms \nof today \u00a0\u2013 and the more small firms are encouraged to \nbecome \u00a0established and expand, the greater the chances \nthat an economy will benefit from large-scale organisations \nin the future.\n\u25a0 Small firms may enjoy lower average costs than larger \nones and this benefit could be passed on to the consumer \ntoo. Costs could be lower because wage rates paid to sta ff  \nmay be less than the salaries paid in large organisations, \nor the sheer cost of the administration and management \nstructure of bigger enterprises may increase their costs \ndramatically.\nBusiness category Employees Revenue Capital employed\nMedium 51\u2013250 over \u20ac10m to \u20ac50m over \u20ac10m to \u20ac34m\nSmall 11\u201350 over \u20ac2m to \u20ac10m over \u20ac2m to \u20ac10m\nMicro 10 or fewer up to \u20ac2m up to \u20ac2m\nTable 3.1 EU classifications of business size313: Size of business ","81":"based upon the central aim or mission of the business, but \nthey are expressed in terms that provide a much clearer \nguide for management action or strategy.\nCommon corporate objectives\n1 Profit maximisation\nAll the stakeholders in a business are working for reward. \nProfi ts are essential for rewarding investors in a business \nand for fi nancing further growth. Pro fi ts are necessary \nto persuade business owners \u00a0\u2013 or entrepreneurs \u00a0\u2013 to take \nrisks. But what does \u2018pro fi t maximisation\u2019 really mean? In \nsimple terms, it means producing at that level of output \nwhere the greatest positive di ff erence between total \nrevenue and total costs is achieved.\nTh e chief argument in support of this objective is that it \nseems rational to seek the maximum pro fi t available from \na given venture. Not to maximise pro fi t, according to this \nobjective, is seen as a missed opportunity. However, there \nare serious limitations with this corporate objective:\n\u25a0 The focus on high short-term profits may encourage \ncompetitors to enter the market and jeopardise the long-\nterm survival of the business.\n\u25a0 Many businesses seek to maximise sales in order to secure \nthe greatest possible market share, rather than to maximise \nprofits. The business would expect to make a target rate of \nprofit from these sales.\n\u25a0 The owners of smaller businesses may be more concerned \nwith ensuring that leisure time is safeguarded. The issues \nof independence and retaining control may assume greater \nsignificance than making higher profits.\n\u25a0 Most business analysts assess the performance of a \nbusiness through return on capital employed rather than \nthrough total profit figures.\n\u25a0 Profit maximisation may well be the preferred objective of \nthe owners and shareholders, but other stakeholders will \ngive priority to other issues. Business managers cannot \nignore these. Hence the growing concern over job security \nfor the workforce or the environmental concerns of local \nresidents may force profitable business decisions to be \nmodified, yielding lower profit levels.\n\u25a0 In practice it is very di ff icult to assess whether the point \nof profit maximisation has been reached, and constant \nchanges to prices or output to attempt to achieve it may \nwell lead to negative consumer reactions.\n2 Profit satisficing\nTh is means aiming to achieve enough pro fi t to keep the \nowners happy but not aiming to work fl at out to earn as \nmuch pro fi t as possible. Th is objective is o ft en suggested \nas being common among owners of small businesses who \nwish to live comfortably but do not want to work longer \nand longer hours in order to earn even more pro fi t. Once a satisfactory level of pro fi t has been achieved, the owners \nconsider that other aims take priority \u00a0\u2013 such as more \nleisure time.\n3 Growth\nTh e growth of a business \u00a0\u2013 usually measured in terms \nof sales or value of output \u00a0\u2013 has many potential bene fi ts \nfor the managers and owners. Larger fi rms will be less \nlikely to be taken over and should be able to bene fi t from \neconomies of scale. Managers will be motivated by the \ndesire to see the business achieve its full potential, from \nwhich they may gain higher salaries and fringe bene fi ts. \nIt is also argued that a business that does not attempt to \ngrow will cease to be competitive and, eventually, will lose \nits appeal to new investors. Business objectives based on \ngrowth do have limitations:\n\u25a0 expansion that is too rapid can lead to cash-flow problems\n\u25a0 sales growth might be achieved at the expense of lower \nprofit margins\n\u25a0 larger businesses can experience diseconomies of scale\n\u25a0 u s i n g  p r o f i t s  t o  f i n a n c e  g r o w t h \u00a0\u2013 retained earnings \u00a0\u2013 can \nlead to lower short-term returns to shareholders\n\u25a0 g r o w t h  i n t o  n e w  b u s i n e s s  a r e a s  a n d  a c t i v i t i e s \u00a0\u2013 away from \nthe firm\u2019s core activities \u00a0\u2013 can result in a loss of focus and \ndirection for the whole organisation.\n4 Increasing market share\nClosely linked to overall growth of a business is the market \nshare it enjoys within its main market. Although the two \nare usually related, it is possible for an expanding business \nto su ff er market share reductions if the market is growing \nat a faster rate than the business itself. Increasing market \nshare indicates that the marketing mix of the business is \nproving to be more successful than that of its competitors. \nBene fi ts resulting from having the highest market share \u00a0\u2013 \nbeing the brand leader \u00a0\u2013 include:\n\u25a0 retailers will be keen to stock and promote the best-selling \nbrand\n\u25a0 p r o f i t  m a r g i n s  o ff ered to retailers may be lower than \ncompeting brands as the shops are so keen to stock it \u00a0\u2013 this \nleaves more profit for the producer\n\u25a0 eff ective promotional campaigns are o ft en based on \u2018buy \nour product with confidence \u00a0\u2013 it is the brand leader\u2019.\n5 Survival\nTh is is likely to be the key objective of most new business \nstart-ups. Th e high failure rate of new businesses means \nthat to survive for the fi rst two years of trading is an \nimportant aim for entrepreneurs. Once the business \nhas become fi rmly established, then other longer-term \nobjectives can be established.42Cambridge International AS and A Level Business","82":"Reuters achieving its aims\nReuters, one of the world\u2019s largest news agencies, \nhas returned to profitability after several years of \nlosses. It aims to increase value for shareholders, \nand the fact that Reuters\u2019s shares have risen 7% \nfaster than average share prices suggests that \nthe company is becoming increasingly successful. \nProfits are being made for two main reasons. \nMany jobs have been lost in the company in recent \nyears as a result of the chief executive\u2019s policy \nof cutting costs. Secondly, an ambitious growth \nobjective has been established to increase sales \nand this target is being reached. New products \n(such as electronic trading) and new markets \n(such as China, Russia and India) have allowed \nan increase in sales of over 6% this year. This \nis above the growth target that was set. Some \nanalysts are predicting a 40% increase in profit \nfor the company next year.ACTIVITY  4.3\n[18 marks, 25 minutes]\n1 What evidence is there that Reuters is meeting \nits objectives? [4]\n2 Explain two benefits to the managers and other \nemployees of the company from having clearly \nstated company aims and objectives. [6]\n3 To what extent does the policy of increasing \nshareholder value conflict with other objectives \nthe business might have? [8]\n7 Maximising short-term sales revenue\nTh is could bene fi t managers and sta ff  when salaries and \nbonuses are dependent on sales revenue levels. However, if \nincreased sales are achieved by reducing prices, the actual \nprofi ts of the business might fall.\n8 Maximising shareholder value\nTh is could apply to public limited companies and directs \nmanagement action towards taking decisions that would \nincrease the company share price and dividends paid to \nshareholders. Th ese targets might be achieved by pursuing \nthe goal of pro fi t maximisation. Th i s  s h a r e h o l d e r - v a l u e  \nobjective puts the interests of shareholders above those \nof other stakeholders. Chapter 5 considers the potential \nconfl ict between this objective and the aims of other \nstakeholder groups.6 Corporate social responsibility (CSR)\nShould fi rms have objectives about social, environmental \nand ethical issues? Increasingly, there is general agreement \nthat fi rms must adopt a wider perspective when setting \ntheir objectives and not just be aiming for pro fi ts or \nexpansion. One reason for this is the much greater adverse \npublicity given to business activity that is perceived as \nbeing damaging to stakeholder groups and the wider \nworld. Increasingly, in fl uential pressure groups are forcing \nbusinesses to reconsider their approach to decision-\nmaking. Also, legal changes \u00a0\u2013 at the local, national and \nEU level \u00a0\u2013 have forced businesses to refrain from certain \npractices. Firms can no longer pay sta ff  very low wages \nor avoid legal responsibility for their products. Managers \nclearly wish to avoid con fl icts with the law or bad publicity.\nCorporate social responsibility: this concept applies to \nthose businesses that consider the interests of society by \ntaking responsibility for the impact of their decisions and \nactivities on customers, employees, communities and the \nenvironment.\nKEY TERM\nTh ere are other reasons for these trends in business \nobjectives \u00a0\u2013 increasingly, consumers and other \nstakeholders are reacting positively to businesses that act \nin \u2018green\u2019 or socially responsible ways. Examples include:\n\u25a0 Firms that promote organic and vegetarian foods.\n\u25a0 Retailers that advertise the proportion of their products \nmade from recycled materials.\n\u25a0 Businesses that refuse to stock goods that have been \ntested on animals or foods based on genetically modified \ningredients.\nIn these cases, is the action being taken because trade and \nreputation might be lost if it is not or because such action \nis increasingly pro fi table? Might businesses be criticised \nfor \u2018jumping on the corporate social responsibility \nbandwagon\u2019 rather than praised for their genuine concern \nfor society and the environment? Conceivably, fi rms are \nbeing ethical or environmentally conscious because they \nhave an objective that Peter Drucker, a famous writer \non management, calls \u2018public responsibility\u2019, because \nthey want to behave in these ways. Many consumer \ngroups and pressure groups are still dubious as to \nwhether these objectives are based on genuinely held \nbeliefs or not. Chapter 5  discusses the impact of social \nand environmental pressures on business and business \nstakeholders in more detail.434: Business objectives ","83":"Objectives and decision-making\nEff ective decision-making requires clear objectives. \nBusiness managers cannot decide on future plans \nof action \u00a0\u2013 strategies \u00a0\u2013 if they are uncertain of \nwhich direction they want to take the business in. \nTh is essential link between decisions and objectives is \nillustrated in the decision making framework model \nshown in  Figure 4.4.\nTh e stages in this decision making framework are:\n1 S e t  o b j e c t i v e s .\n2 A s s e s s  t h e  p r o b l e m  o r  s i t u a t i o n .\n3 Gather data about the problem and possible solutions.\n4 C o n s i d e r  a l l  d e c i s i o n  o p t i o n s .\n5 M a k e  t h e  s t r a t e g i c  d e c i s i o n .\n6 Plan and implement the decision.\n7 R e v i e w  i t s  s u c c e s s  a g a i n s t  t h e  o r i g i n a l  o b j e c t i v e s .\nClearly, without setting relevant objectives at the start of \nthis process, e ff ective decision-making for the future of the \nbusiness becomes impossible.\nHow corporate objectives might change\nTh ere are many examples of businesses changing their \ncorporate objectives over time. Th ese are some of the \nreasons for this:\n1 A  n e w l y  f o r m e d  b u s i n e s s  m a y  h a v e  s a t i s f i e d  t h e  \u2018 s u r v i v a l \u2019  \nobjective by operating for several years, and now the owners \nwish to pursue objectives of growth or increased profit.2 T h e  c o m p e t i t i v e  a n d  e c o n o m i c  e n v i r o n m e n t  m a y  c h a n g e ,  \nso the entry into the market of a powerful rival or the start \nof an economic recession may lead a firm to switch from \ngrowth to survival as its main aim \u00a0\u2013 or even just to revise its \nobjectives for sales and profits downwards.\n3 A short-term objective of growth in sales or market share \nmight be adapted to a longer-term objective of maximising \nprofits from the higher level of sales.\nFactors that determine the corporate \nobjectives of a business\nCorporate culture\nClearly, not all businesses pursue the same objectives. \nTh ere are several factors that in fl uence the nature of the \nobjectives established for any business. Chief among these \nis the culture of the organisation. Th is can be de fi ned \nas the code of behaviour and attitudes that in fl uence \nthe decision-making style of the managers and other \nemployees of the business. Culture is a way of doing things \nthat is shared by all those in the organisation. Culture is \nabout people, how they perform and deal with others, how \naggressive they are in the pursuit of objectives and how \nadaptable they are in the face of change. If directors are \naggressive in pursuit of their aims, are keen to take over \nor defeat rival businesses and care little about social or \nenvironmental factors, then the objectives of the business \nwill be very di ff erent to those of a business owned and \ncontrolled by directors with a more people- or social-\noriented culture.\nThe size and legal form of the business\nOwners of small businesses may be concerned only with \na satisfactory level of pro fi t\u00a0\u2013 called \u2018satis fi cing\u2019. Larger \nbusinesses, perhaps controlled by directors rather than \nowners, such as most public limited companies, might \nbe more concerned with rapid business growth in order \nto increase the status and power of the managers. Th i s  \nis oft en a result of a development known as the \u2018divorce \nbetween ownership and control\u2019, which nearly always \nexists in large companies with professional directors \nwho do not own it. Th ey may be more concerned about \ntheir bonuses, salaries and fringe bene fi ts\u00a0\u2013 which o ft en \ndepend on business size \u00a0\u2013 than on maximising returns to \nshareholders.\nPublic-sector or private-sector businesses\nState-owned organisations tend not to have profit as a \nmajor objective. The aims of these organisations can \nvary greatly, but when the service they provide is not \ncharged for, such as education and health services, \nthen a financial target would be inappropriate.

All forms of communication that are not oral \nare sometimes referred to as \u2018non-verbal\u2019 communication.\nWritten communication\nMany managers still like everything to be in writing. \nTh ey will, therefore, tend to use letters, memos, notices \non boards, reports, minutes of meetings and diagrams for \ntechnical matters, such as house plans.

Th e s e  i n c l u d e :\n\u25a0 market research\n\u25a0 product design\n\u25a0 pricing\n\u25a0 advertising\n\u25a0 distribution\n\u25a0 customer service\n\u25a0 packaging.\nSo, marketing is a very important business activity. To \nsum up, marketing activities are all those associated \nwith identifying the particular wants and needs of \ntarget-market customers and then trying to satisfy those \ncustomer needs better than your competitors do. Th i s  \nmeans that market research is needed to identify and \nanalyse customer needs. With this knowledge, strategic \ndecisions must then be taken about product design, \npricing, promotion and distribution.\nTh is is the de fi nition of marketing that you should keep \nin mind during your study of the next few chapters.\nRelated concepts\nMarkets\nTh is term is vital to achieve an understanding of marketing. \nIt has two rather di ff erent meanings. Perhaps the most \nobvious meaning is the \u2018place or mechanism where buyers \nand sellers meet to engage in exchange\u2019 . Th e weekly fruit \nand vegetable market would be one example of this. \nShopping centres and auctions are other examples of \nmarkets. Increasingly, there is no physical place in the \nsense of a geographical location. Th e use of the internet \nas a marketing tool has meant that a market can exist \nelectronically with no physical meeting between buyer \nand\u00a0seller.\nTh e  t e r m  market  also refers to the group of consumers \nthat is interested in a product, has the resources to purchase the product and is permitted by law to purchase it. It can \nbe broken down into di ff erent de fi nitions. For example, \nthe potential market for a product is the total population \ninterested in the product. Th e  t a r g e t  m a r k e t  i s  t h e  s e g m e n t  \nof the available market that the business has decided to \nserve by directing its product towards this group of people.\nHuman needs and wants\nA human need is a basic requirement that an individual \nwishes to satisfy. Physical needs include food, clothing and \nshelter. Individual needs include desires for knowledge, \nrecognition, a ff ection, self-esteem and self-expression, e.g. \nthrough the clothes people wear.\nWants are broader in their perspective. Th ey are things \nwe do not need for our survival as biological creatures, but \nthey do satisfy certain requirements or individual needs \nof most human beings. So we need food to physically \nsurvive, but, although we may want a juicy steak or fresh \ncrab, we do not need these particular expensive items of \nfood to survive. Th ey may, however, satisfy an individual \nneed, such as being seen in an expensive restaurant. We \nneed shelter to protect us from the elements \u2013 but our \ndesire for a house by the beach is a \u2018want\u2019, not an essential \nrequirement for survival.\nWants are o ft en described as being goods and services \nthat ful fi l the needs of individual consumers. Many \nmarketing managers believe that it is their aim to convert \nhuman needs into wants by very persuasive product \nimagery through advertising.\nValue and satisfaction\nDo cheap goods always o ff er good value? Do expensive \ngoods always provide consumer satisfaction? Clearly, the \nanswer to both of these questions is \u2018no\u2019. Value is not the \nsame as cheapness. A consumer will consider a product \nto be of good value if it provides satisfaction at what is \nthought to be a reasonable price. Customer satisfaction \nis not always obtained with very expensive products \u2013 a \ngood might be so expensive that, although it performs its \nfunction well, the consumer believes that \u2018good value\u2019 has \nnot been received.\nTwo examples will help to support these points:\n1 A consumer who is very hungry may be looking to eat in a \ntop-class restaurant. If none is open, and he decides to eat \nin a pizza caf\u00e9, the meal may be not as good as in a top-class \nrestaurant but because it is much cheaper, it might still \nprovide value  and, therefore, customer satisfaction.\n2 A very expensive car may perform well, but once it is \npurchased the consumer may have a sense of disappointment \nif he feels that it is actually too expensive for \u2018what it o ff ers \u2019 . \nThere will be no sense of good value and no long-term \nconsumer satisfaction.Marketing : the management task that links the business \nto the customer by identifying and meeting the needs \nof customers profitably \u2013 it does this by getting the right \nproduct at the right price to the right place at the right time.\nKEY TERM\n214Cambridge International AS and A Level Business","88":"13Factors Affecting Enzyme ActivityEnzyme Activity can be InhibitedEnzyme activity can be prevented by enzyme inhibitors Inhibition can be competitive or non-competitive.COMPETITIVE INHIBITIONmolecules that bind to the enzyme that they inhibit.1) Competitive inhibitor molecules have a similar shape to that of the substrate molecules.2) They compete with the substrate molecules to bind to the active site, but no reaction takes place.3) Instead they block the active site, so no substrate molecules can fit in it. ienzymesubstrateinhibitor molecule fits into active site because it is a similar shape to the substrate moleculeenzyme-controlled reaction without an inhibitorsame reaction with a competitive inhibitor \u2014 rate increases as substrate concentration is increasedSubstrate Concentration4) How much the enzyme is inhibited depends on the relative concentrations of the inhibitor and the substrate.5) If there's a high concentration of the inhibitor, it'll take up nearly all the active sites and hardly any of the substrate wil get to the enzyme.6) But if there's a higher concentration of substrate, then the substrate's chances of getting to an active site before the inhibitor increase.

In the short run \u2212 the period in which no changes to capacity can be made \u2212 costs may be classi fi ed \nas follows:\n\u25a0 Fixed costs:  These remain fixed no matter what the level of \noutput, such as rent of premises.\n\u25a0 Variable costs : These vary as output changes, such as the \ndirect cost of materials used in making a washing machine \nor the electricity used to cook a fast-food meal. Semi-\nvariable costs include both a fixed and a variable element, \nfor example the electricity standing charge plus cost per \nunit used, salesperson\u2019s fixed basic wage plus a commission \nthat varies with sales.\n\u25a0 Marginal costs:  These are the additional costs of producing \none more unit of output, and will be the extra variable \ncosts needed to make this extra unit.

In practice, it may not be very easy or \neven worthwhile to classify every cost into the categories \nexplained above:\n\u25a0 Are labour costs necessarily vari able, direct costs? Certainly \nnot, because when labour is unoccupied because of a lack \nof orders, most businesses will continue to employ and pay \nworkers in the short run. Wages then become an overhead \ncost, which cannot be directly allocated to any particular \noutput. Similarly a television presenter may be employed on a \nfixed-contract salary, which will not be related to the amount \nof work done. In addition, the salaries of administration, selling \nand other sta ff  are always considered to be an indirect cost, \nprobably fixed in the short run, because these costs cannot be \nidentified with any one of the firm\u2019s products or services.\n\u25a0 Telephone charges in a busy factor y could be directly allocated \nto each range of products made, as long as an accurate and \nreliable record was kept of the purpose of each call. In practice, \nthis may not be worthwhile and telephone charges would \nnormally be considered as an indirect overhead expense.\nTOP TIP\nNot all direct costs are variable costs.

Strategic analysis is aided by a \nnumber of di ff erent techniques and the rest of this chapter \nfocuses on these.\nSWOT analysis\nA SWOT analysis  provides information that can be \nhelpful in matching the fi rm\u2019s resources and strengths \nto\u00a0the competitive environment in which it operates. It is, therefore, useful in strategy formulation and \nselection. It comprises:\nStrengths:  These are the internal factors about a business that \ncan be looked upon as real advantages. These could be used \nas a basis for developing a competitive advantage. They might \ninclude: experienced management, product patents, loyal \nworkforce and good product range. These factors are identified \nby undertaking an internal audit of the firm. This is o ft en \nundertaken by specialist management consultants who analyse \nthe e ff ectiveness of the business and the e ff ectiveness of each \nof its departments and major product ranges.\nWeaknesses:  These are the internal factors about a business \nthat can be seen as negative factors. In some cases, these \ncan be the flip side of strengths. For example, whereas a \nlarge amount of spare manufacturing capacity might be a \nstrength in times of a rapid economic upturn, if it continues to \nbe unused then it could add substantially to a firm\u2019s average \ncosts of production. Weaknesses might include: poorly trained \nworkforce, limited production capacity and ageing equipment. \nThis information would also have been obtained from an \ninternal audit.\nOpportunities:  These are the potential areas for expansion \nof the business and future profits. These factors are identified \nby an external audit of the market the firm operates in and its \nmajor competitors. Examples include: new technologies, export \nmarkets expanding faster than domestic markets, and lower \nrates of interest increasing consumer demand.\nThreats:  These are also external factors gained from \nan external audit. This audit analyses the business and \neconomic environment, market conditions and the strength \nof competitors. Examples of threats are: new competitors \nentering the market, globalisation driving down prices, changes \nin the law regarding the sale of the firm\u2019s products, and changes \nin government economic policy.\nTh is information is usually presented in the form of a four-\nbox grid as shown in Table 38.1.\nSWOT and strategic objectives\nTh e SWOT diagram focuses on the key issues under \neach heading. A brief outline of each of these could then \naccompany the grid to make it more useful to the managers \nresponsible for strategic planning. Th i s  a p p r o a c h  h e l p s  \nmanagers assess the most likely successful future strategies \nand the constraints on them. A business should not \nnecessarily pursue the most pro fi table opportunities. It may \nstand a better chance of developing a competitive advantage \nby identifying a good \u2018 fi t\u2019 between the fi rm\u2019s strengths and \npotential opportunities. In many cases, a business may \nneed to overcome a perceived weakness in order to take \nadvantage of a potential opportunity. SWOT is a common \nstarting point for developing new corporate strategies, but \nit is rarely su ffi  cient. Further analysis and planning are \nusually needed before strategic choices can be made.SWOT analysis: a form of strategic analysis that identifies \nand analyses the main internal strengths and weaknesses \nand external opportunities and threats that will influence \nthe future direction and success of a business.\nKEY TERM544Cambridge International AS and A Level Business","96":"5 1A.1 THE CHEMISTRY OF LIFE CHEMISTRY FOR BIOLOGISTS\n \u2022Co valent bonding: the atoms involved in the reaction share electrons (see fig D).

Consequently, the molecule has a part that is slightly negative and a part that is slightly positive. This separation of  charge is called a dipole, and the tiny charges are represented as \u03b4\n + and \u03b4  \u2013 (see fig F). The molecule is described as a polar molecule.

Biological molecules are often organic compounds. Organic compounds all contain carbon atoms. They also contain atoms of  hydrogen, oxygen and, less frequently, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus. Most of  the material in your body that is not water consists of  these organic molecules. An understanding of  why organic molecules are special will help you to understand the chemistry of  biological molecules including carbohydrates, lipids and proteins.\nEach carbon atom can make four bonds and so it can connect \nto four other atoms. Carbon atoms bond particularly strongly to other carbon atoms to make long chains. The four bonds of  a carbon atom usually form a tetrahedral shape. This means carbon compounds can be rings, branched chains or any number of  three-dimensional (3D) shapes (see fig A). In some carbon compounds small molecules (monomers) bond with many other similar units to make a very large molecule called a polymer. The ability of  carbon to combine and make macromolecules (large molecules) is the basis of  all biological molecules and provides the great variety and complexity found in living things.\nThese two bonds\nare in the plane\nof the paper.\nor more often as:C This bond goesback behind the\nplane of the paper.\nThis bond sticks out ofthe plane of the paper.\ncan be shown with corners representing carbons, and itshydrogens ignored:\nH\nCC\nHHCC\nHH\nHH\nHHC\nHC\nHHCC\nC\nHHC\nHHHH HH\nThis part \nof a chain molecule:\n\u25b2 fig A  T he bonds in a carbon atom have a complicated 3D shape.

They are also important for storing energy and they form an important part of  the cell wall in plants, fungi and bacteria. Sugars and starch are the best known carbohydrates. Sucrose is the familiar white crystalline table sugar; glucose is used as a fuel by the cells of  our bodies. Starch is in rice, flour and potatoes. But the group of  substances called carbohydrates contains many more compounds, as you will discover.\n\u25b2 fig B  Carbohydr ates are important molecules in both plants and animals \n\u2013 and carbohydrate foods like this bread play a major role in the human \ndiet.\nThe basic structure of  all carbohydrates is the same. They consist \nof  carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. There are three main groups of  carbohydrates: monosaccharides, disaccharides and \npolysaccharides. Some have more complex molecules than others (see Section 1A.3).\nMONOSACCHARIDES: THE SIMPLE SUGARS \nMonosaccharides are simple sugars in which there is one oxygen \natom and two hydrogen atoms for each carbon atom in the molecule. A general formula for this can be written (CH\n2O)n. Here \nn can be any number, but it is usually low.\nTriose sugars (n = 3) have three carbon atoms and the general \nformula C3H6O3. They are important in mitochondria, where the \nrespiration process breaks down glucose into triose sugars (see Book 2 Chapter 7A).1A1.4 CP1 1.3 1.2(ii) 1.2(i)\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

They are made of  many monosaccharide units \njoined by condensation reactions that create glycosidic bonds (see Section\u00a01A.2 fig E). Polysaccharides \ndo not have the sweet taste of  many mono- and disaccharides, but these complex polymers include some very important biological molecules.\nMolecules with between 3 and 10 sugar units are known as oligosaccharides, while molecules \ncontaining 11 or more monosaccharides are known as true polysaccharides. The glycosidic bonds in the polysaccharide can be broken to release monosaccharide units for cellular respiration.\nThe glycosidic bond between two glucose units is split by a process known as hydrolysis (see fig\u00a0A).  \nThe hydrolysis reaction is the opposite of  the condensation reaction that created the molecule, so water \nis added to the bond. Starch and glycogen are gradually broken down into shorter and shorter chains and eventually single sugars are left. Disaccharides break down to form two monosaccharides. Hydrolysis takes place during digestion in the gut, and also in the muscle and liver cells when the carbohydrate stores are broken down to release sugars for use in cellular respiration (see Book 2 Chapter 7A).\nH\nHOH\nOHO\n1 46\n2 35\n1,4-glycosidic bondH\nHO OHH O\n1 4\n2 356\nH\nHOH O\n1 4\n2 356H\nOOHH O\n1 4\n2 356\nmaltosecondensation hydrolysis\nH2O H2O\u03b1-glucose \u03b1-glucose\n\u25b2 fig A  Gly cosidic bonds are made by condensation reactions and broken down by hydrolysis.\nCARBOHYDRATES AND ENERGY \nMONOSACCHARIDES AND DISACCHARIDES\nEvery chemical reaction taking place in a cell needs energy. This energy is supplied by a substance \ncalled adenosine triphosphate, ATP . This ATP comes from the breakdown of  the monosaccharide \nglucose, using oxygen, in the process of  cellular respiration. Y ou will learn much more about cellular respiration later in your course in Book 2 Chapter 7A. \nThe arrangement of  atoms in a molecule of  \u03b1-glucose means that it can be broken down completely \nin a series of  reactions, if  oxygen is available. The compounds that are produced, called the end products, are waste carbon dioxide and water, and lots of  ATP . This supplies the energy needed for all the reactions in the cell. LEARNING TIP\nGlycosidic bonds are formed \nwith the removal of a molecule of water in condensation reactions. \nGlycosidic bonds are broken \nwith the addition of a molecule of water in hydrolysis reactions.\nEXAM HINT\nBe careful not to say that this produces or creates energy for cell processes. Energy cannot be created \u2013 it is converted from one form to another. Here, chemical energy is transferred from the glucose molecule to the ATP molecules.LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n \u25fcKnow the diff erence between monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides, including glycogen and starch.\n \u25fcExplain how monosaccharides join to f\norm polysaccharides through condensation reactions forming glycosidic \nbonds, and how these can be split through hydrolysis reactions.\n \u25fcR\nelate the structures of monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides to their roles in providing and  \nstoring energy.1.4 CP1 1.3 1.2(ii) 1.2(i)\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

The diagram shows how the experiment can be set up. You'll need the apparatus shown in the diagram as well as a stopwatch. A drop of iodine in potassium iodide is put into each well on a spotting tile. A known concentration of amylase and starch are then mixed together in a test tube. A dropping pipette is used to put a drop of this mixture into one of the wells containing the iodine solution on the spotting tile at regular intervals and the resulting colour is observed. The iodine solution goes dark blue-black when starch is present but remains its normal browny-orange colour when there's no starch around. You can see how fast amylase is working by recording how long it takes for the iodine solution to no longer turn blue-black when starch\/amylase mixture is added. Repeat the experiment using different concentrations of amylase. Make sure that you also repeat the experiment three times at each amylase concentration.The experiments above show you how you can investigate the effects of temperature and enzyme concentration on the rate of enzyme-controlled reactions. You can also alter these experiments to investigate the effect of a different variable, such as pH (by adding a buffer solution with a different pH to each test tube) or substrate concentration (you could use serial dilutions to make substrate solutions with different concentrations).

Other monosaccharides and disaccharides \u2013 for example, fructose, maltose and sucrose \u2013 are also easily absorbed in the body and rapidly converted to glucose. So foods containing monosaccharides and disaccharides are a good source of  relatively instant energy (see fig B). However, these cannot be used to store energy because they are chemically active, and they are very soluble in water, so they affect the water balance of  the cells. Y ou will find out why that is so important in Chapter 2A.\n\u25b2 fig B  T hese medjool dates contain a lot of fructose.

The sugars produced by photosynthesis are rapidly converted into starch, which is insoluble and compact but can be broken down rapidly to release glucose when it is needed. Storage organs such as sweet potatoes (yams) are particularly rich in starch. Y ou will find out a lot more about the importance of  starch in plants in Chapter 4A of  this book.\nStarch consists of  long chains of  \u03b1-glucose. But if  you look at it \nmore closely you will see that it is a mixture of  two compounds:\n \u2022Amylose\n: an unbranched polymer of  between 200 and 5000 \nglucose units. As the chain lengthens the molecule spirals, which makes it more compact for storage.\n \u2022Amylopectin\n: a branched polymer of  glucose units. The \nbranching chains have many terminal glucose units that can be broken off  rapidly when energy is needed.\nAmylose and amylopectin are both long chains of  \u03b1-glucose units \u2013 so why are the molecules so different? It all depends on the carbon atoms involved in the glycosidic bonds.\nAmylose has only 1,4-glycosidic bonds, which is why the \nmolecules are long unbranched\u00a0chains.\nIn amylopectin, many of  the glucose molecules are joined by \n1,4-glycosidic bonds, but there are also a few 1,6-glycosidic bonds. This results in the branching chains that change the properties of  the molecule.EXAM HINT\nBe sure you can relate the structure of the molecule to its function as \na storage molecule.\nCoiling makes it compact so it takes up less space and doesn\u2019t get in \nthe way of organelles or substances moving around the cell.\nLarge molecules are insoluble so they do not interfere with the water \npotential of the cell.\nPRACTICAL SKILLS CP1\nTesting for starch\nIf you add a few drops of reddish-brown iodine solution to a sample \ncontaining starch (whether it is a solid sample or a sample in solution), the iodine solution will turn blue-black (see fig C).\nStarch has a combination of  straight-chain amylose and branched-\nchain amylopectin molecules (see fig D). This combination explains why carbohydrate foods like rice and pasta are so good for you when you are doing sport or hard physical work.

Like starch, it is very compact, but the glycogen molecule has more 1,6-glycosidic bonds than the starch molecule, giving it many side branches.

They are an \nintegral part of  all cell membranes and are also used as an energy store. Lipids contain many carbon\u2013\nhydrogen bonds and almost no oxygen. When lipids are oxidised in the respiration process, the bonds are broken and carbon dioxide and water are the final products. This reaction can be used to drive the production of  much ATP (see Sections 1A.3, 2A.2 and 2A.4 and Book 2 Chapter 5A). Lipids, \nespecially triglycerides, store about three times as much energy as the same mass of  carbohydrates. Many plants and animals convert spare food into oils or fats as an energy store to use when needed. For example, the seeds of  plants contain lipids to provide energy for the seedling when it starts to grow, which is why seeds are such an important food source for many animals.\nFATS AND OILS\nFats and oils are important groups of  lipids. Chemically they are very similar, but fats such as butter are solids at room temperature whereas oils such as olive oil are liquids (see fig A). Fats come mainly from animal sources while oils are mainly from plant sources.\nLike carbohydrates, the chemical elements that all lipid molecules contain are carbon, hydrogen and \noxygen. However, lipids contain a much lower proportion of  oxygen than carbohydrates. Fats and oils contain two types of  organic chemical substance, fatty acids and glycerol (propane-1,2,3-triol). These are combined using ester bonds. Glycerol has the chemical formula C\n3H8O3 (see fig B).\nAll fatty acids have a long hydrocarbon chain \u2013 a folded backbone of  carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms attached, and a carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) at one end. Living tissues contain more than 70 different types of  fatty acid. Fatty acids vary in two ways:\n \u2022the length of\n the carbon chain can differ (but is often 15\u201317 carbon atoms long)\n \u2022the f\natty acid may be a saturated fatty acid or an unsaturated fatty acid.\nIn a saturated fatty acid, each carbon atom is joined to the one next to it by a single covalent bond. A common example is stearic acid (see fig C). In an unsaturated fatty acid, the carbon chains have one or more double covalent bonds between carbon atoms in them. A monounsaturated fatty acid has one carbon\u2013carbon double bond and a polyunsaturated fatty acid has more than one carbon\u2013carbon double bond (see fig\u00a0D). Linoleic acid is an example of  a polyunsaturated fatty acid.

Proteins make \nhair, skin and nails, the enzymes needed for metabolism and digestion, and many of  the hormones that control the different body systems. They enable muscle fibres to contract, make antibodies that protect you from disease, help clot your blood and transport oxygen in the form of  haemoglobin. Understanding the structure of  proteins helps you understand the detailed biology of  cells and organisms. Like carbohydrates and lipids, proteins contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. In addition, they all contain nitrogen and many proteins also contain sulfur.\nProteins are a group of  macromolecules made up of  many \nsmall monomer units called amino acids joined together by condensation reactions. Amino acids combine in long chains to produce proteins. There are about 20 different naturally occurring amino acids that can combine in different ways to produce a wide range of  different proteins.\nAMINO ACIDS\nAll amino acids have the same basic structure, which is represented as a general formula. There is always an amino group (\u2013NH\n2) and a carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) attached to a carbon \natom (see fig A). The group known as the R group varies between amino acids. Some amino acids contain sulfur and selenium in their R group. The R groups are not involved in the reactions which join the amino acids together, but the structure of  the R group does affect the way the amino acid interacts with others within the protein molecule. This will mainly depend on whether the R\u00a0group is polar or not, and these interactions affect the tertiary structure of  the protein formed (see page 18).\nThis part is common \nto all amino acids and \nis just shown as a \nshaded rectangle in the examples below.general formula\nglycine cysteineN HR\nH HCC OH\nO\nHC H2SH\n \n\u25b2 fig A  Some differ ent amino acids.

They join in a condensation reaction and a molecule of  water is released. A peptide bond is formed when two amino acids join, and a dipeptide is the result (see fig B). The R group is not involved in this reaction. More and more amino acids join to form polypeptide chains, which contain from about 100 to many thousands of  amino acids. A polypeptide forms a protein when the structure of  the chain changes by folding or coiling or associates with other polypeptide chains.\namino acid 1\ndipeptidepeptide\nbondamino acid 2 (inverted)\nOH + OH N H\nH HCC\nON HHH\nCCO\nOH N H\nH HC C\nONHH\nCCOcondensation hydrolysisR1\nR1R2\nR2H2O H2O\n\u25b2 fig B  Amino acids ar e the building blocks of proteins, joined together  \nby peptide bonds.\nBONDS IN PROTEINS\nThe peptide bond between amino acids is a strong bond.

These same bonds are essential in protein \nstructures. In amino acids, tiny negative charges are present on the oxygen of  the carboxyl groups and tiny positive charges are present on the hydrogen atoms of  the amino groups. When these charged groups are close to each other, the opposite charges attract, forming a hydrogen bond. Hydrogen bonds are weak but, potentially, they can be made between any two amino acids in the correct position, so there are many of  them holding the protein together very firmly. They are very important in the folding and coiling of  polypeptide chains (see fig C). Hydrogen bonds break easily and reform if  pH or temperature conditions change.\nDISULFIDE BONDS\nDisulfide bonds form when two cysteine molecules are close together in the structure of  a polypeptide (see fig C). An oxidation reaction occurs between the two sulfur-containing groups, resulting in a strong covalent bond known as a disulfide bond. These disulfide bonds are much stronger than hydrogen bonds but they happen much less often. They are important for holding the folded polypeptide chains in place.\nhydrogen bondhydrogen bond\ndisul\ufb01de bonddisul\ufb01de bond\n\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\n\u25b2 fig C  Hydr ogen bonds and disulfide bonds maintain the shape of protein molecules and this determines  \ntheir function.\nIONIC BONDS\nIonic bonds can form between some of  the strongly positive and negative amino acid side chains \nwhich are sometimes found deep inside the protein molecules. They are strong bonds, but they are not as common as the other structural bonds.\nY our hair is made of  the protein keratin. Some methods of  styling hair change the bonds within the protein \nmolecules. Blow drying or straightening hair breaks the hydrogen bonds and temporarily reforms them with the hair curling in a different way until the hydrogen bonds reform in their original places.\nPerming is a chemical treatment which is used in some hair salons to completely change the way hair \nlooks for weeks or months. The chemicals break the disulfide bonds between the polypeptide chains and reform them in a different place. This effect is permanent \u2013 hair will stay styled in that particular way until it is cut off.\nPROTEIN STRUCTURE\nProteins can be described by their primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure (see fig\u00a0D). \n \u2022T\nhe primary structure of  a protein is the sequence of  amino acids that make up the polypeptide \nchain, held together by peptide bonds.\n \u2022T\nhe secondary structure of  a protein is the arrangement of  the polypeptide chain into a regular, \nrepeating three-dimensional (3D) structure, held together by hydrogen bonds. One example is the right-handed helix (\u03b1-helix), a spiral coil with the peptide bonds forming the backbone and the R\u00a0groups protruding in all directions. Another is the \u00df-pleated sheet, in which the polypeptide chain folds into regular pleats held together by hydrogen bonds between the amino and carboxyl ends of  the amino acids. Most fibrous proteins have this type of  structure. Sometimes there is no regular secondary structure and the polypeptide forms a random coil.LEARNING TIP\nRemember that fibrous proteins \nhave a simpler structure and so tend to be more stable to changes in temperature and pH.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds and ionic bonds between the R groups of  nearby amino acids hold these 3D shapes in place (see page 17). Globular proteins are an example of  tertiary structures.\n \u2022T\nhe quaternary structure of  a protein is only found in proteins consisting of  two or more \npolypeptide chains. The quaternary structure describes the way these separate polypeptide chains fit together in three dimensions. Examples include some very important enzymes and the blood pigment haemoglobin. \nChanges in conditions such as temperature or pH affect the bonds that keep the 3D shapes of  proteins in place. Even small changes can cause the bonds to break, resulting in the loss of  the 3D shape of  the protein. This is called denaturation. Because the 3D structure of  these proteins is important to the way they work, changing conditions inside the body can cause proteins such as enzymes to stop working properly.\nalanine cysteine\nlysineglycineleucinePrimary structur e the linear sequence\nof amino acids in a peptide.\nTertiary structure the three-dimensional\nfolding of the secondary structur e.\nQuater nary structure the three-dimensional\narrangement of mo re than one tertiary polypeptide.Secondary structur e the repeating\npatter n in the structure  of the peptide\nchains, such as an \u03b1-helix or \u03b2-pleated\nsheets.\n\u25b2 fig D  T he 3D structure of proteins\nFIBROUS AND GLOBULAR PROTEINS\nFIBROUS PROTEINS\nThe complex structures of  large protein molecules relate closely to their functions in the body. Fibrous proteins have little or no tertiary structure. They are long, parallel polypeptide chains with occasional cross-linkages that form them into fibres. They are insoluble in water and are very tough, which makes them ideally suited to their structural functions within organisms. Fibrous proteins appear in the structure of  connective tissue in tendons and the matrix of  bones, as the silk of  spiders\u2019 webs and silkworm cocoons, and as the keratin that makes up hair, nails, horns and feathers.\nCollagen is a fibrous protein that gives strength to tendons, ligaments, bones and skin. It is the most \ncommon structural protein found in animals \u2013 up to 35% of  the protein in your body is collagen. \nCollagen is extremely strong \u2013 the fibres have a tensile strength similar to that of  steel. This is due to the unusual structure of  the collagen molecule. Its quaternary structure has three polypeptide chains, each up to 1000 amino acids long. The primary structure of  these chains is repeating sequences of  glycine with two other amino acids \u2013 often proline and hydroxyproline. The three polypeptide \u03b1-chains are arranged in a unique triple helix, held together by a very large number of  hydrogen \nbonds. Collagen molecules can be up to several millimetres long and are often found together in fibrils that are held together to form collagen fibres.

They fold into \nspherical (globular) shapes. The character of  the R groups on the amino acids plays an important role in the formation of  globular proteins. Some R groups are hydrophobic. They repel water and will not mix or dissolve in it. They are usually found on the inside of  globular proteins. Some R groups are hydrophilic \u2013 they have an affinity for water. These groups tend to be found on the outside of  globular proteins. The large size of  these globular protein molecules affects their behaviour in water. \nThe carboxyl and amino ends give them ionic properties, so you might expect them to dissolve in \nwater and form a solution. Instead, the molecules are so big that they form a colloid. In a colloid, microscopic particles of  one substance (in this case protein) are suspended throughout another substance (in this case water). They do not settle, and they cannot easily be separated. Globular proteins are important as they hold molecules in position in the cytoplasm. Globular proteins are also important in your immune system \u2013 for example, antibodies are globular proteins. Enzymes and some hormones are globular proteins and help maintain the structure of  the cytoplasm (you will learn more about globular proteins as enzymes in Sections 2B.1 and 2B.2).\nHaemoglobin is one of  the best known globular proteins. It is a very large molecule with 574 amino \nacids arranged in four polypeptide chains which are connected by disulfide bonds. Each polypeptide chain surrounds an iron-containing haem group (see fig F). The iron enables the haemoglobin to bind and release oxygen molecules, and the arrangement of  the polypeptide chains determines how easily the oxygen binds or is released (see Section 1B.2 to find out how haemoglobin takes up and gives up oxygen in the tissues of  your body).\nEach polypeptide holds one\niron-containing haem group.Each haem group transportsone oxygen molecule.4 polypeptide chainsbond together to makethe globular structur\ne\nof haemoglobin.\n\u25b2 fig F  T he complex quaternary structure of haemoglobin produces a globular protein containing four haem groups \nwhich can carry oxygen to the tissues of the body.LEARNING TIP\nRemember that fibrous proteins \nare more stable than globular proteins and tend to create structures rather than being metabolically active.\nEXAM HINT\nGlobular proteins have a specific 3D shape which means they can be metabolically active as enzymes or hormones. If the shape is altered slightly by changing conditions, they lose their ability to function.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

These cells accumulate chemicals from the blood, especially cholesterol. This leads to a plaque (also known as an atheroma) forming on the endothelial lining of  the artery (see fig C). Fibrous tissue and calcium salts also build up (increase in amount) around the atheroma, turning it into a hardened plaque. This hardened area means that part of  the artery wall is less elastic and narrower than it should be. This is atherosclerosis and is summarised in fig B.\nThe plaque causes the lumen of  the artery to become much smaller. This increases the blood \npressure, making it harder for the heart to pump blood around the body. The raised blood pressure makes damage more likely in other areas of  the endothelial lining and more plaques will form.  This will make the blood pressure even higher, and so the problem gets worse. There are many factors that are linked to the development of  atherosclerosis. Y ou will look at these in more detail  in Chapter 1C.\nEFFECT OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS ON HEALTH\nAtherosclerosis can have many serious effects on the health of  an individual. The development  of  atherosclerosis can be summarised as: damage to the endothelium of  the arteries \u2192 inflammatory response \u2192 accumulation of  cholesterol \u2192 atheroma \u2192 fibrous tissue\/calcium salts \u2192 plaque \u2192 narrowing\/loss of  elasticity of  the artery.\nANEURYSMS\nIf  an area of  an artery is narrowed by plaque, blood tends to collect behind the blockage. The artery bulges and the wall is put under more pressure than usual, so it becomes weakened. This is known as an aneurysm. The weakened artery wall may split open, leading to massive internal bleeding. Aneurysms frequently happen in the blood vessels supplying the brain or in the aorta, especially when it passes through the abdomen. The massive blood loss and drop in blood pressure are often fatal, but if  aneurysms are diagnosed they can be treated by surgery before they burst.\nRAISED BLOOD PRESSURE\nThe arteries narrowed due to plaques on the walls cause raised blood pressure. This can lead to severe damage in a number of  organs, including the kidneys, the eyes and the brain. The high pressure damages the tiny blood vessels where your kidney filters out urea and other substances from the blood. If  the vessels feeding the kidney tubules become narrowed, the pressure inside them gets even higher and proteins may be forced out through their walls. If  you have high blood pressure, your doctors can test for protein in your urine as a sign of  kidney damage. \nSimilarly, the tiny blood vessels supplying the retina of  your eye are easily damaged. If  they become \nblocked or leak, the retinal cells are starved of  oxygen and die and this can cause blindness. \nBleeding from the capillaries into the brain results in one type of  stroke (see below).\nHEART DISEASE\nThere are many kinds of  heart disease, but the two most common ones are angina and myocardial \ninfarction (heart attack); both are closely linked to atherosclerosis (see figs B and D ).\nIn angina, plaques build up slowly in the coronary arteries, reducing blood flow to the parts of  the heart muscle beyond the plaques. Often symptoms are first noticed during exercise, when the cardiac muscle is working harder and needs more oxygen. The narrowed coronary arteries cannot supply enough oxygenated blood and the heart muscle resorts to anaerobic respiration. This causes a gripping pain in the chest that can extend into the arms, particularly the left one, and the jaw, and often also causes breathlessness. The symptoms of  angina subside once exercise stops, but the experience is painful and frightening.\nFortunately, most angina is relatively mild. It can be helped by taking regular exercise, losing weight \nand not smoking. The symptoms can be treated by drugs that cause rapid dilation of  the coronary blood vessels so that they supply the cardiac muscle with the oxygen it needs. However, if  the blockage of  the coronary arteries continues to get worse, so will the symptoms of  the angina. Other drugs are then used to dilate the blood vessels and reduce the heart rate. Unfortunately, drugs cannot \n\u25b2 fig C  F atty deposits like these \nin an artery cause disease and death in millions of people  every year.\nEXAM HINT\nMake sure you are clear about \nall of the different terms.

As you have seen, the wall of  an artery affected  by a plaque is stiffened, making it much more likely to suffer cracks or damage. Platelets touch the damaged surface of  the plaque and the clotting process is triggered (see Section 1B.2). The plaque itself  may rupture and break open, and the cholesterol that is released will also cause the platelets to trigger the blood clotting process. A clot may also develop because the endothelial lining is damaged, for example by high blood pressure or smoking.\nA clot that forms in a blood vessel is known as a thrombosis.  \nThe clot can rapidly block the whole blood vessel, particularly if  it is already narrowed by a plaque. A clot that gets stuck in a coronary artery is known as a coronary thrombosis. The clot  can block the artery, starving the heart muscle beyond that point of  oxygen and nutrients, and this often leads to a heart attack  (see fig E).Blargest heart attack\n(cardiac arre st) follows\nif blockage is at C\nmedium heart attack \u2013 death \nof some heart tissue if blockage is at Bsmall heart attack \u2013 death of small amount of heart tissue if blockage is at AABC\n\u25b2 fig E  T he size and severity of a heart attack is closely related to the \nposition of the blockage in the coronary artery.\nDuring a heart attack, there is chest pain in the same areas as in \nan angina attack, but it is much more severe. The pain may occur at any time, although exercise may start it, and it often lasts for several hours. Death may occur very rapidly with no previous symptoms, or it may happen after several days of  feeling tired and suffering symptoms mistaken for indigestion.\nIt is very important to react quickly if  you suspect someone is \nhaving a heart attack. Give them two full-strength aspirin tablets to help stop the blood clotting, and get them to hospital as fast as you can.\nSTROKES\nA stroke is caused by an interruption to the normal blood supply to an area of  the brain. This may be due to bleeding from damaged capillaries or a blockage cutting off  the blood supply to the brain. A blockage is usually caused by a blood clot, an atheroma or a combination of  the two. Sometimes, the blood clot forms somewhere else in the body and is carried in the bloodstream until it gets stuck in an artery in the brain. The damage happens very quickly. A blockage in one of  the main arteries leading to the brain causes a very serious stroke that may lead to death. In one of  the smaller arterioles leading into the brain, the effects may be less disastrous.\nThe symptoms of  strokes vary, depending on how much of  the \nbrain is affected. Very often, the blood is cut off  from one part or one side of  the brain only (see fig F). Symptoms include dizziness, confusion, slurred speech, blurred vision or partial loss of  vision (usually one eye) and numbness. In more severe strokes, there can be paralysis, usually on one side of  the body.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

They are one of the major classes of biological molecules, along with proteins and nucleic acids. Despite the vast diversity of life on Earth, all living organisms share some basic biochemistry and contain a few common carbon-based compounds that interact in similar ways. In this section, we will explore the structure and function of carbohydrates in living systems.\n\nMost Carbohydrates are Polymers@@@Polymers in Carbohydrates\nCarbohydrates, like proteins and nucleic acids, are polymers. Polymers are large, complex molecules made up of repeating units called monomers. In the case of carbohydrates, these monomers are simple sugars, also known as monosaccharides. Some examples of monosaccharides include glucose, fructose, and galactose.\n\nCarbohydrates are Made from Monosaccharides@@@Composition of Carbohydrates\nAll carbohydrates are composed of the elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The monomers that make up carbohydrates are monosaccharides, which can be further classified based on the number of carbon atoms they contain. For example, glucose is a hexose sugar, meaning it has six carbon atoms in each molecule. Other common monosaccharides include pentose sugars (five carbon atoms) and heptose sugars (seven carbon atoms).\n\nIsomers of Glucose@@@Structural Differences in Glucose\nThere are two forms of glucose: alpha and beta glucose. These are isomers, meaning they have the same molecular formula but differ in the arrangement of atoms. The only difference between these two forms is the orientation of the hydroxyl (-OH) group on the first carbon atom. Although this may seem like a minor difference, it has important effects on the properties and functions of these carbohydrates.\n\nCondensation Reactions Join Monosaccharides Together@@@Joining Monosaccharides\nMonosaccharides can join together through condensation reactions, also known as dehydration synthesis. In this reaction, two molecules are joined together and a water molecule is released. This process forms glycosidic bonds between the monosaccharides. A disaccharide is formed when two monosaccharides join together, and larger polysaccharides can be formed when several monosaccharides join together.\n\nExample of Condensation Reaction@@@Formation of Disaccharides\nTwo alpha-glucose molecules can join together through a condensation reaction to form maltose. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom from one monosaccharide and the hydroxyl group from the other combine to form a water molecule. The remaining oxygen atom then forms a glycosidic bond between the two molecules, linking them together.\n\nMore Disaccharides@@@Forming Sucrose and Lactose\nSucrose, also known as table sugar, is a common disaccharide formed from a condensation reaction between a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule. Lactose, the sugar found in milk, is also a disaccharide formed from a glucose molecule and a galactose molecule. These disaccharides have different glycosidic bonds and therefore have different properties and functions in living systems.\n\nRemember to Include Water in Condensation Reactions@@@The Importance of Water in Condensation Reactions\nWhen showing a condensation reaction, it is important to include a water molecule as a product. This shows that a dehydration reaction has occurred and can help to illustrate the formation of glycosidic bonds between monosaccharides. It is essential to keep track of water molecules in biochemical reactions as they play important roles in the structure and function of biomolecules.","1":" 3Carbohydrates\n\nCarbohydrates are an important group of molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. They are a primary source of energy for living organisms and participate in various cellular processes. Carbohydrates can be categorized as monosaccharides, disaccharides, or polysaccharides depending on their chemical structure and the number of sugar units they contain. @@Optimal Source of Energy\n\nOne of the main functions of carbohydrates is to provide energy for living organisms. Monosaccharides are the simplest form of carbohydrates and are quickly and easily broken down by the body to produce energy. Glucose, for example, is a monosaccharide that is used by cells to produce ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell. Polysaccharides, on the other hand, are larger and more complex molecules that require more time and energy to break down into usable forms of energy. They are often stored in the body as a reserve energy source to be used when needed. \n\n@@Polymers and Hydrolysis Reactions\n\nCarbohydrates, like other biological molecules, are made up of repeating units called monomers. These monomers are linked together by covalent bonds, forming polymers. The process of breaking down polymers into their constituent monomers is known as hydrolysis. This process involves the breaking of bonds between monomers and the addition of a water molecule. Hydrolysis reactions are essentially the opposite of condensation reactions, which link monomers together to form polymers. \n\n@@Specific Example: Hydrolysis of Carbohydrates\n\nOne specific example of hydrolysis in carbohydrates is the breakdown of polysaccharides into their monomer units. Starch, a common polysaccharide found in plants, is made up of thousands of glucose units linked together. In the presence of water and the enzyme amylase, starch is broken down into individual glucose molecules through hydrolysis reactions. These individual glucose molecules can then be easily transported and used as a source of energy by the cell. \n\n@@Benedict\u2019s Test for Sugars\n\nThe Benedict\u2019s test is a chemical test used to detect the presence and concentration of reducing sugars in a solution. Reducing sugars, such as glucose, have a free aldehyde or ketone group that can act as a reducing agent, causing a color change in the Benedict\u2019s reagent. This test is often used in biology and chemistry laboratories to identify the amount of reducing sugars in a sample. It is an important tool for studying carbohydrates and their functions in living organisms. \n\n@@Differentiating Between Reducing and Non-Reducing Sugars\n\nNot all sugars have the ability to act as reducing agents. Non-reducing sugars, such as sucrose, do not have a free aldehyde or ketone group and therefore cannot undergo the Benedict\u2019s test. To test for non-reducing sugars, the sample must first be hydrolyzed into its monomer units, which will then be able to react with the Benedict\u2019s reagent. This process involves breaking the glycosidic bond between the monomers through the addition of acid, and then neutralizing the solution before carrying out the Benedict\u2019s test. This test can help distinguish between reducing and non-reducing sugars in a sample.","2":" 34 Cell Division \u2014 Investigating Mitosis\n\n@@@Introduction\nMitosis is a fundamental process in cell division that allows all organisms to grow and reproduce. It is essential for the growth and repair of tissues, as well as for the development of new individuals. In this section, we will discuss the techniques used to study mitosis, including how to stain and observe root cells under a microscope, as well as how to calculate the mitotic index.\n\n@@@Staining and Preparing Root Cells for Mitosis Observation\nIn order to study mitosis, it is necessary to stain and prepare root cells for observation under a microscope. This process involves several steps, including cutting a root tip, fixing it in acid, staining it, and mounting it on a slide. These steps are outlined below:\n\n1. Cut a 1 cm section from the tip of a growing root, such as an onion. The tip is where growth occurs and therefore where mitosis is most active.\n2. If using ethano-orcein stain, the root tip should also be fixed in ethanoic acid.\n3. Submerge the root tip in a boiling tube containing 1 M hydrochloric acid and incubate in a water bath at 60 \u00b0C for 5 minutes.\n4. Rinse the root tip with cold water using a pipette and allow it to dry.\n5. Cut off the very tip of the root and use a mounted needle to break it open and spread out the cells.\n6. Add a few drops of stain and let it sit for a few minutes.\n7. If using Feulgen stain, an additional rinse is required.\n8. Place a cover slip over the cells and gently press down to flatten the tissue.\n9. Avoid smearing the cover slip to prevent damage to the chromosomes.\n10. The stained cells are now ready to be observed under a microscope.\n\n@@@Observing Mitosis with an Optical Microscope\nOnce the root cells are prepared and stained, they can be observed under an optical microscope. Follow these steps to properly use a microscope for mitosis observation:\n\n1. Clip the prepared slide onto the microscope stage.\n2. Select the lowest-powered objective lens for the lowest magnification.\n3. Use the coarse adjustment knob to bring the stage close to the objective lens.\n4. Look through the eyepiece and use the coarse adjustment knob to move the stage downwards until the image is almost in focus.\n5. Use the fine adjustment knob to obtain a clear image.\n6. If more magnification is needed, switch to a higher-powered objective lens and refocus.\n7. Be sure to label your drawings and record the magnification used.\n\n@@@Calculating the Mitotic Index\nOne important aspect of studying mitosis is calculating the mitotic index. This index is the proportion of cells undergoing mitosis in a given sample and can provide insight into the rate of tissue growth and any abnormalities that may be present. The formula to calculate the mitotic index is as follows:\n\nmitotic index = number of cells with visible chromosomes \/ total number of cells observed\n\nA high mitotic index in a constantly growing tissue, such as a plant root tip, is expected. However, in other tissue samples, a high mitotic index could indicate tissue repair or even cancerous growth. The mitotic index can therefore provide valuable information about the health and functioning of different tissues.

In this section, we will explore the various factors that contribute to the development of cardiovascular diseases and how the study of epidemiology can help us better understand these factors.\n\n@@@Risk, Correlation, and Causation\nUnderstanding the concepts of risk, correlation, and causation is fundamental to understanding the causes of diseases. Risk refers to the probability of developing a disease, which can vary among different populations and individuals. Some factors can increase or decrease an individual's risk of developing a disease, such as lifestyle choices and genetic predispositions.\n\nCorrelation, on the other hand, refers to a strong relationship between two sets of data. For example, in studying the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and obesity, there may be a correlation between the two, as seen in fig B. However, correlation does not necessarily imply causation. Further research is needed to determine if there is a direct causal link between two factors.\n\nCausation, on the other hand, refers to when a specific factor directly causes a particular effect. In the case of cardiovascular diseases, there are many risk factors that can contribute to the development of the disease, and it is essential to understand their individual and collective impact.\n\n@@@Epidemiology\nThe study of patterns of diseases and their causes is called epidemiology. This field of study helps us identify risk factors and determine how different factors can influence the likelihood of developing a disease. By studying disease patterns across populations, researchers can gain a better understanding of the causes of diseases and develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.\n\n@@@Uncorrected Proof and Limitations of Data\nWhen presented with data, it is critical to consider the limitations and potential biases present. An uncorrected proof, as seen in fig B, may not accurately represent the entire population, and further research is necessary to confirm any patterns or correlations identified. Additionally, relying on a single set of data may lead to inaccurate conclusions. It is essential to gather data from multiple sources and populations for a more comprehensive understanding of the subject.\n\n@@@Checkpoint Questions\n1. The difference between risk, correlation, and causation is that risk refers to the probability of developing a disease, correlation refers to a strong relationship between two sets of data, and causation refers to an event or factor directly causing a specific effect.\n2. The fact that the risk of dying from heart disease is three times greater for smokers than non-smokers does not necessarily mean that an individual smoker will die from heart disease because there may be other underlying factors at play, such as genetics or lifestyle choices.\n3. Some reasons why people may stay obese include unhealthy dietary habits, lack of physical activity, and environmental factors such as food availability. The increasing rate of obesity can be attributed to societal changes, such as the availability of processed foods, sedentary lifestyles, and increased accessibility to technology.\n4. Drawing a bar chart to show the information from the Maldives, we can see that cardiovascular diseases account for the majority of deaths, followed by smoking and obesity. Compared to fig B from the UAE, the Maldives have a higher percentage of deaths from cardiovascular diseases, similar rates of smoking, and a lower rate of obesity. To make accurate comparisons, we would need to consider other factors, such as age and gender demographics, as well as lifestyle and dietary habits.\n\n@@@Subject Vocabulary\nNon-communicable conditions\n- diseases that are not caused by pathogens and cannot be spread from one person to another.\n\nRisk - the probability that an event will take place.\n\nProbability - a measure of the chance or likelihood that an event will occur.\n\nRisk factors - factors that can increase or decrease the risk of developing a disease.\n\nMultifactorial disease - a disease that results from the interactions of many factors, rather than a single cause.\n\nEpidemiology - the study of patterns of health and disease to identify the causes and patterns of infection.\n\nCorrelation - a strong tendency for two sets of data to change together.\n\nCausation - when a specific factor directly causes a particular effect.","5":"\n@@\nSPECIFICATION REFERENCE1C2 INVESTIGATING THE CAUSES OF CVDs1.16 1.12\nCONTENT\nThis section will discuss the learning objectives of investigating the causes of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).\n\n@@@LEARNING OBJECTIVES \nCONTENT\nThis subsection will outline the specific learning objectives related to investigating the causes of CVDs.\n\n\u25fc@@@Evaluating the Design of Studies \nCONTENT\nIn this subsection, the importance of evaluating the design of studies used to determine health risk factors will be explored.

","6":"\n@@@Risk Factors for CVDs: An Overview \n\nCardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of death worldwide, and it is important to understand the factors that contribute to their development. There are several risk factors that can make a person more likely to develop CVDs, including genetic predisposition, age, gender, and lifestyle choices.\n\nGenetic Predisposition to CVDs \nOne of the major risk factors for CVDs is a genetic predisposition. This means that an individual may have inherited certain genes from their parents that make them more likely to develop CVDs at some point in their life. Identical twin studies have been an important resource in investigating the role of genetics in CVDs, as identical twins have the same genes and any differences between them can be attributed to environmental factors.\n\nAge and Gender \nAs people age, their blood vessels naturally begin to lose their elasticity and narrow, making them more susceptible to CVDs. This is particularly true for heart disease, which is more likely to occur in older individuals. Gender also plays a role, with men under the age of 50 being more likely to develop heart disease than women. This is attributed to the protective effects of the hormone estrogen, but after menopause when estrogen levels decrease, women become at a higher risk for CVDs.\n\nLifestyle Factors \nAnother important area of focus when it comes to CVDs risk factors is lifestyle choices. Research has shown that certain behaviors, such as smoking, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diet, can greatly increase a person's risk of developing CVDs. These are factors that individuals have control over and can make changes to in order to improve their heart health.\n\nInvestigating the Causes of CVDs \n\nEpidemiological Studies \nEpidemiological studies have been an important tool in identifying risk factors for CVDs. These studies look at large groups of people over a long period of time and analyze data to identify patterns and connections between different factors and diseases. By looking at the data, researchers can identify lifestyle factors that are linked to a higher risk of developing CVDs.\n\nIdentical Twin Studies \nIdentical twin studies have been particularly useful in investigating the genetic component of CVDs. By comparing identical twins to non-identical twins, researchers can determine the role of genetics in CVDs risk. A major twin study conducted in Sweden showed a strong genetic link to heart disease in younger men, but this link became less significant in older men.\n\nFactors Affecting Validity and Reliability \nWhen designing major studies, researchers must ensure their results will be valid and reliable. This involves careful selection of participants, precise measurements, and unbiased methods. Longitudinal studies, which follow the same individuals over many years, and meta-analysis, which combines data from multiple studies, are also important in obtaining accurate and significant results.\n\nEvaluating and Understanding the Data \nUnderstanding the data from these studies is crucial in interpreting the results. It is important to evaluate the quality of the study and the significance of the findings. This can help researchers and individuals make informed decisions about their risk for CVDs and take steps to prevent or manage the disease.\n\n@@@Looking Ahead: Prevention and Management of CVDs \nNow that we have a better understanding of the risk factors for CVDs, the next step is to focus on prevention and management. By making lifestyle changes and controlling risk factors, individuals can reduce their chances of developing CVDs and improve their overall cardiovascular health.

Maintaining cardiovascular health and understanding these risk factors is essential for preventing and managing CVD.\n\n@@@Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease\nAge has been identified as a major risk factor for CVD, with individuals aged 55-64 being at a higher risk for developing the disease. Other factors such as smoking and gender also play a significant role, as shown in the Jordanian study conducted in 2017. Smoking was found to increase the risk of CAD, and the study showed a higher proportion of CAD in male participants than female participants.\n\n@@@The Impact of Inactivity on CVDs\nResearch has shown that regular physical activity plays a crucial role in lowering the risk of CVD. Studies have demonstrated that exercise helps to lower blood pressure, prevent obesity and diabetes, and reduce stress, all of which contribute to the development of CVD. The Harvard University study on male participants also revealed that those who changed from being inactive to taking regular exercise had a 23% lower mortality rate compared to their inactive counterparts.\n\n@@@Benefits of Exercise for Women\nSimilarly, a study on female nurses showed that a more active lifestyle is linked to a reduced risk of atherosclerosis and other CVDs. This study further emphasizes the benefits of regular physical activity for both men and women in maintaining cardiovascular health.\n\n@@@High Blood Pressure and Atherosclerosis\nHigh blood pressure, or hypertension, is both a risk factor and a sign of atherosclerosis. The condition is caused by the build-up of plaque and narrowing of the artery walls, leading to increased pressure in the blood vessels. Measuring blood pressure is an essential tool in diagnosing and managing CVD, as it reflects the health of the heart and blood vessels.\n\n@@@Use of Blood Pressure Monitors\nDoctors often use blood pressure monitors to track their patients' blood pressure and diagnose any abnormalities that may indicate the presence of CVD. Some individuals may also choose to purchase and use their own blood pressure monitors, allowing them to regularly monitor and manage their blood pressure levels as a preventive measure against CVD.","9":"\n\n@@@Title: Understanding the Evidence for Preventing Coronary Heart Disease\nScientific Evidence and Its Use in Health Organizations\nThere is a vast amount of scientific evidence on the main factors that increase the risk of heart disease. This evidence is used by governments and health organizations to produce guidelines and recommendations for improving people's health. The question is, why do they do this?\n\n@@@Title: Prevention is Better Than Cure\nThe Negative Effects of Cardiovascular Disease and Its Cost\nCardiovascular disease has a significant impact on individuals, their families, and society as a whole. The cost of treating heart disease in hospitals is high, and when people are too ill to work, it affects their families and the companies they work for. It is cheaper for health service providers to prevent people from needing surgery through the use of drugs. And it is even more cost-effective and beneficial for individuals if they can avoid needing medication altogether. In short, prevention is better than treatment for many reasons, including cost and individual health. However, convincing people to change their lifestyle habits and prevention can be challenging.\n\n@@@Title: The Dangers of Smoking for CVDs\nThe High Risk of Smoking for Cardiovascular Disease and the Benefits of Quitting\nSmoking is one of the most significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease, as supported by numerous reliable studies. However, quitting smoking has shown to decrease the risk of developing heart disease, with an almost 50% reduction after just one year. Additionally, research has shown that after ten years of quitting smoking, the arteries of former smokers are almost identical to those who have never smoked. Despite the overwhelming evidence and available support to quit smoking, the number of smokers worldwide remains high, resulting in millions of deaths from CVDs and related cancers.\n\n@@@Title: Health Education and Individual Choices\nThe Role of Health Education Programs in Promoting Awareness of Lifestyle Choices\nHealth education programs in schools and communities play a crucial role in ensuring that people are aware of the risks associated with various lifestyle choices. However, individuals must make their own choices and decisions regarding their health and the risks they are willing to take.\n\n@@@Title: The Battle Against Obesity\nThe Link Between Obesity and CVDs and the Importance of Exercise\nThere is a widespread understanding that obesity is closely linked to cardiovascular disease, and many people turn to dieting to lose weight. However, research has also shown that regular exercise is equally important in protecting against CVDs. Unfortunately, more people choose to go on a diet than to maintain a regular exercise routine. A study on 20,000 men revealed that being obese but fit is less risky than being not overweight but unfit, although the best option is to be the right weight and fit. The challenges lie in making significant lifestyle changes, including cutting down on food and incorporating more healthy eating habits and regular exercise into one's daily routine.","10":" SPECIFICATION\n@@@SPECIFICATION\nIn this section, the specification and learning objectives for understanding the benefits and risks of treatments for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) will be discussed.\n\nOnce a patient has signs of cardiovascular disease, there are a \nnumber of different treatment options available to them.\n\n@@@TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR CVDs\nChanging lifestyle, such as improving diet, giving up smoking and taking more exercise can help, but there are also various drugs that can be given to help reduce the risks associated with CVDs.\n\n@@@THE BENEFITS AND RISKS OF TREATMENTS\nAll medicines carry some risk, so it is important to be aware of both the benefits and potential risks of any treatment for CVDs.\n\n@@@CONTROLLING BLOOD PRESSURE\nOne of the major risk factors for CVDs is hypertension, or high blood pressure. Therefore, controlling blood pressure is crucial in reducing the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.\n\n@@@ANTIHYPERTENSIVES\nAntihypertensives are drugs that are used to reduce blood pressure. They work by targeting different pathways in the body to help lower blood pressure.\n\n@@@COMMONLY PRESCRIBED ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS\nSome of the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs are diuretics, beta blockers, and sympathetic nerve inhibitors. These drugs work in different ways to lower blood pressure.\n\n@@@THE ROLE OF ANGIOTENSIN IN BLOOD PRESSURE\nAngiotensin is a hormone that stimulates the constriction of blood vessels, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure. ACE inhibitors, a type of antihypertensive drug, block the production of angiotensin to help keep blood pressure lower.\n\n@@@THE BENEFITS AND RISKS OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVE TREATMENTS\nThe benefits of antihypertensive drugs are clear, as they can reduce both the risk of developing CVDs and the risk of associated complications such as kidney and eye damage. However, there are also risks associated with these treatments, including the potential for low blood pressure and side effects.\n\n@@@SIDE EFFECTS OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS\nSome of the common side effects of antihypertensive drugs include coughs, swelling of the ankles, impotence, tiredness and fatigue, and constipation. These side effects may not be as serious as the risks of untreated hypertension, but they can still significantly impact a patient's quality of life.\n\n@@@STATINS\nAnother type of drug used to treat CVDs is statins, which work to lower cholesterol levels in the blood. Statins are effective at reducing LDL (bad cholesterol) levels and improving the overall balance of LDL to HDL (good cholesterol).\n\n@@@THE IMPACT OF STATINS ON ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nStatins also have the added benefit of reducing inflammation in the lining of the arteries, which can help prevent the development of atherosclerosis (the hardening and narrowing of arteries that can lead to CVDs).\n\n@@@BENEFITS OF STATINS IN DIFFERENT GROUPS\nFig B shows the results of a study on the effectiveness of statins in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in different groups of people. The results suggest that statins can have a greater impact on certain high-risk categories, such as Asian Indians.\n\n@@@EXAM HINT\nIf you are asked to discuss or evaluate the use of medication or some \nother treatment for CVDs, it is important to consider both the potential benefits and risks of the treatment. This includes understanding the different types of medicines and their modes of action, as well as potential side effects and their impact on quality of life.","11":" CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH AND RISK\n\n@@@Introduction  \nCardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death worldwide, with certain populations being at higher risk for these conditions. The use of statins, a class of drugs commonly used to manage cholesterol levels, has shown both benefits and risks for individuals with a high risk of developing CVD. In addition, alternative methods like plant sterols and stanols have been researched as potential options for managing cholesterol levels. This text examines the benefits and risks associated with statin use and the effectiveness of plant sterols and stanols in reducing the risk of CVD.\n\n@@@The Benefits of Statins  \nStudies have shown that statins have a strong positive effect in reducing the risk of CVD, particularly in high-risk populations like Asian Indians. In a UK study, 6595 middle-aged men who took a specific statin for five years had a lower risk of death or heart attack, even 10 years after they stopped taking the drug. Compared to those who took a placebo, the statin users had a significantly lower risk of heart disease-related death or heart attack. The study also found that some level of protection from these events lasted for up to 10 years after stopping statin use.\n\n@@@The Risks of Statins  \nAlthough the majority of people experience little or no side effects when taking statins, there are two rare but serious risks associated with their use. One is a form of muscle inflammation that can be fatal, and the other is liver problems. For example, from 1990 to 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration reported over 3000 cases of muscle reaction to statins, although millions of Americans were taking the drug during this time period. Additionally, in rare cases, statins may cause liver damage, with an estimated risk of two in a million for those taking the drug lovastatin.\n\n@@@The Subtle Risk of Diet Change \nOne concern with the use of statins is that individuals may rely solely on the medication to lower their cholesterol and may neglect to make other healthy lifestyle changes, such as improving their diet. This can result in an increased risk for other health issues related to a poor diet, as statins do not provide protection against these other risks.\n\n@@@Exploring Alternatives: Plant Stanols and Sterols  \nPlant stanols and sterols, compounds that are similar in structure to cholesterol, have been found to be effective in reducing cholesterol absorption from the gut into the blood. While they are sold as a food rather than a drug, research has shown that they can effectively lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels if consumed regularly in recommended amounts. This can result in a 25% reduction in the risk of heart disease, as shown in various studies.\n\n@@@The Effectiveness of Plant Sterols  \nScientific evidence from several studies has confirmed the effectiveness of plant sterols in reducing harmful LDL cholesterol levels if used correctly. Eating 2 grams per day of plant sterols has been shown to significantly reduce LDL cholesterol levels by approximately 10%. ","12":"\n\n@@@69 1C.7 The Benefits and Risks of Treatment for Cardiovascular Health and Risk\n\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major health concern and can lead to serious complications such as heart attack and stroke. To prevent or treat these conditions, medication is often prescribed. However, like any treatment, these drugs come with both benefits and risks. In this section, we will discuss some common types of medications used to treat CVD and their potential effects on the body.\n\n@@@Anticoagulants and Platelet Inhibitory Drugs\n\nAnticoagulants and platelet inhibitory drugs are commonly used after heart surgery or to prevent blood clots from forming. These medications work by reducing the body's ability to clot the blood, which can help prevent serious complications. One example of an anticoagulant is warfarin, which is commonly used in rat poison but is carefully monitored for use in humans. Platelet inhibitory drugs, like aspirin, make the blood less sticky and reduce its ability to clot.\n\n@@@The Risks of Taking Aspirin\n\nAspirin, a commonly used drug for pain relief, is also effective in preventing cardiovascular problems. However, it also carries known side-effects, such as irritation of the stomach lining and potential for bleeding in the stomach. In some cases, combining aspirin with another platelet inhibitory drug, such as clopidogrel, can increase the risk of developing serious side-effects. Finding the right balance between preventing blood clots and avoiding potentially dangerous side-effects can be challenging for doctors.\n\n@@@The Importance of Monitoring\n\nWhen using anticoagulant drugs like warfarin, careful monitoring is essential to prevent internal bleeding. Factors such as age, overall health, and existing medications must be taken into consideration when prescribing these drugs. Ensuring the correct balance between preventing blood clots and avoiding potential complications is crucial for the overall success of treatment.\n\n@@@The Impact of Medication Side-Effects\n\nThe potential side-effects of medication can result in patients giving up on their treatment. This can be due to the perceived risk, or the patient's belief of the potential harm of the medication, versus the actual risk, which is the true likelihood of experiencing negative effects. For example, a patient may read about the potential side-effects of a drug and decide to stop taking it, even though the actual risk of experiencing those side-effects may be very low.\n\n@@@Plant Stanols and Sterols\n\nFig C on a company's website illustrates the potential effects of plant stanols and sterols on blood cholesterol levels. These compounds have a similar structure to cholesterol and have been shown to help reduce blood cholesterol in those consuming them. The data displayed in the graph are scientifically acceptable, as they show a clear correlation between consuming plant stanols and sterols and reduced cholesterol levels.\n\n@@@The Use of Placebos in Drug Trials\n\nPlacebos, or inactive substances, are often used in drug trials as an experimental control. They are used to understand the true effects of a drug by comparing the results of the actual medication to those of the placebo. Placebos are typically used in drug trials to ensure the validity and accuracy of the results.\n\n@@@Ethical Considerations in Drug Trials\n\nThe study shown in fig B was stopped 2 years early because it was deemed unethical to continue giving patients a placebo. This was due to the fact that the patients taking the placebo were at a disadvantage, as they were not receiving any actual medication to treat their condition. In some cases, it may be considered unethical to use a placebo in a trial, particularly if there are already known effective treatments available.\n\n@@@Targeting Specific Groups\n\nFig B also shows that statins, a type of drug used to lower cholesterol levels, have a greater effect on reducing the risk of CVDs in people with lower levels of HDL (good cholesterol). This suggests that these individuals may benefit more from taking statins compared to others. Considering that all medications have potential side-effects, this graph may also suggest that targeting specific groups based on their risk factors may be the most effective way to reduce CVDs in the population.\n\n@@@Subject Vocabulary\n\nThis section includes definitions for various medical terms and types of drugs commonly used to treat cardiovascular conditions. Knowing the meanings of these terms can help you better understand the benefits and risks associated with taking these medications. Examples include antihypertensive drugs, diuretics, and beta blockers.","13":" 35Cell Division \u2014 Investigating Mitosis\n@@@Introduction\nCell division, specifically mitosis, is an essential process for the growth and repair of cells. In order to better understand this process, it is important to be able to accurately measure the size of cells and identify any artefacts that may interfere with your observations.\n\n@@@Measuring Cell Size\nIn order to accurately measure the size of cells, tools such as an eyepiece graticule and a stage micrometer can be used. These tools act as rulers and provide a scale for measuring the cells. The eyepiece graticule is fitted onto the eyepiece and has numbers but no specific units, while the stage micrometer has an accurate scale and is placed on the stage. The value of the eyepiece graticule divisions can be calculated by comparing it to one division on the stage micrometer, allowing for accurate measurements of cell size.\n\n@@@Using a Formula\nAnother method for determining cell size is by using a formula. By lining up the eyepiece graticule and the stage micrometer, it can be determined that one division on the stage micrometer is equal to 4.5 divisions on the eyepiece graticule. The size of one division on the eyepiece graticule can then be calculated by dividing 0.1mm by 4.5, giving a value of 0.022mm. This formula can be used to calculate the size of cells seen under the microscope by multiplying the number of eyepiece divisions by the calculated value.\n\n@@@Re-calibrating\nIt is important to note that the eyepiece graticule may need to be re-calibrated at different magnifications to ensure accurate measurements.\n\n@@@Artefacts and Their Impact\nArtefacts are particles or objects that are visible under the microscope but are not part of the cell or specimen being observed. They can be caused by various factors, such as dust, air bubbles, and staining methods. Artefacts can interfere with observations and must be carefully avoided during preparation of slides.\n\n@@@Electron Micrographs\nArtefacts are especially common in electron micrographs due to the complex preparation process of specimens. It is important to distinguish between artefacts and organelles to ensure accurate observations. This was a challenge for early scientists, who had to repeatedly prepare specimens in different ways to determine if an object was an artefact or an organelle.\n\n@@@Practice Questions\nA series of practice questions are provided to test understanding of cell size, staining methods, and preparation techniques. It is important to have a clear understanding of these concepts in order to successfully observe and study mitosis under the microscope. Failure to properly prepare slides or distinguish between artefacts and organelles can lead to inaccurate observations and conclusions. \n","14":"\n@@@ Structure of Cell Membrane\nThe cell membrane is a crucial part of all cells, and is present both surrounding eukaryotic cells and dividing organelles within them. It acts as a barrier between the cell and its environment, controlling what substances can enter and leave the cell. This section will explore the different types of cell membranes and their structure in detail.\n\n@@@ Cell-Surface Membranes\nThe outermost layer of all cells is known as the cell-surface membrane. This membrane is partially permeable, allowing certain substances to pass through while preventing others. It controls the movement of molecules through processes such as diffusion, osmosis, and active transport. The cell-surface membrane plays a vital role in maintaining homeostasis within the cell and is constantly being regulated and adjusted in response to the cell's needs.\n\n@@@ Membranes around Organelles\nIn addition to the cell-surface membrane, eukaryotic cells also have membranes surrounding their organelles. These organelle membranes act as a barrier between the organelle and the cytoplasm, and are also partially permeable. They play a crucial role in compartmentalizing the cell and controlling the movement of substances in and out of organelles.\n\n@@@ Fluid Mosaic Structure of Cell Membranes\nThe structure of cell membranes is described by the fluid mosaic model. In this model, the membrane is composed of a double layer (bilayer) of phospholipid molecules, with proteins and carbohydrates scattered throughout. The phospholipids are in constant motion, giving the membrane a fluid-like quality. Various proteins are also present in the membrane, including channel and carrier proteins, which allow for the movement of large molecules and ions. Receptor proteins are also present on the cell-surface membrane, detecting incoming signals from other cells and triggering various cellular responses.\n\n@@@ Components of Cell Membranes\nCell membranes are made up of different components, each with their own unique role. The main components are phospholipids, cholesterol, and proteins, with some lipids also having carbohydrate chains attached.\n\n@@@ Phospholipids as the Barrier\nPhospholipids are a key component of cell membranes and are responsible for the barrier properties of the membrane. These molecules have a head and tail, with the head being hydrophilic (attraction to water) and the tail being hydrophobic (repelling water). When arranged in a double layer, the hydrophobic tails form the interior of the membrane, creating a barrier that prevents water-soluble substances, such as ions, from passing through.\n\n@@@ Role of Cholesterol in Membrane Stability\nCholesterol is a type of lipid present in all cell membranes except bacterial cell membranes. It helps maintain the stability of the membrane by fitting between the phospholipids and restricting their movement. This reduces the fluidity of the membrane and makes it more rigid, providing support for animal cells that lack a cell wall. In particular, this is crucial for cells that are not supported by other cells, such as red blood cells in the blood stream.","15":" 37Cell Membrane Structure\nThe cell membrane is a crucial part of cells, providing them protection and regulating what enters and leaves. It is composed of several different components, each playing an important role in its structure and function. Understanding the structure and permeability of the cell membrane is essential in gaining a better understanding of how cells function and respond to different conditions.\n\n@@@The Permeability of the Cell Membrane can be Investigated in the Lab\nThe permeability of cell membranes can be affected by various conditions, such as temperature and solvent concentration. To investigate the effects of these conditions on cell membrane permeability, a popular experiment is conducted using beetroot cells. This experiment involves measuring the amount of pigment that leaks out of the cells, as the higher the permeability, the more pigment is released.\n\n@@@Conducting an Experiment Using Beetroot\nTo investigate how temperature affects cell membrane permeability, one can conduct the following experiment:\n1. Cut five equal-sized pieces of beetroot using a scalpel on a cutting board. Rinse the pieces to remove any released pigment.\n2. Place each piece of beetroot into a separate test tube containing 5 cm3 of water, measured using a measuring cylinder or pipette.\n3. Set up a water bath and place each test tube containing beetroot at different temperature intervals within the bath (e.g. 10 \u00b0C, 20 \u00b0C, 30 \u00b0C, 40 \u00b0C, 50 \u00b0C) for a predetermined length of time.\n4. After the set time has passed, remove the beetroot pieces from the tubes, leaving only the colored liquid.\n5. Use a colorimeter, a machine that measures the amount of light absorbed by the liquid, to measure the absorbance. The higher the absorbance, the more pigment released and the higher the permeability of the membrane.\n6. Using software, analyze the data and graph the results.\n\n@@@Increasing the Temperature Increases Membrane Permeability\nExperiments, such as the one described above, have shown that membrane permeability is affected by temperature. As the temperature increases, the permeability of the cell membrane also increases. This is due to the movement of phospholipids, the main structural component of the membrane. At low temperatures, phospholipids are closely packed, decreasing permeability. But as the temperature increases, these phospholipids gain more energy and move more, increasing permeability.\n\n@@@The Effects of Different Temperatures\nDifferent temperature ranges have different effects on cell membrane permeability. These include:\n1. Temperatures below 0 \u00b0C - At extremely low temperatures, phospholipids are tightly packed, reducing membrane permeability. However, channel and carrier proteins can deform, increasing permeability. Additionally, ice crystals can form and pierce the membrane, making it highly permeable.\n\n2. Temperatures between 0 and 45 \u00b0C - At these temperatures, phospholipids are not as tightly packed, making the membrane partially permeable. As the temperature increases, phospholipids gain more energy and move more, increasing permeability.\n\n3. Temperatures above 45 \u00b0C - At high temperatures, the phospholipid bilayer begins to break down, causing the membrane to become more permeable. The water inside the cell expands, putting pressure on the membrane. This can also cause deformations in channel and carrier proteins, further increasing membrane permeability.\n\n@@@Investigating the Effects of Solvent Concentration on Membrane Permeability\nIn addition to temperature, solvent concentration can also affect the permeability of the cell membrane. Solvents such as alcohol or acetone can dissolve the lipids in the membrane, making it more permeable. This can be investigated in a similar experiment to the one using temperature, by varying the concentration of the solvent in the water bath and measuring the absorbance of the liquid.\n\n@@@Topic 2B - Cell Membranes\nThe fluid mosaic model is used to describe the structure of the cell membrane. This model suggests that the membrane is composed of various types of molecules, including phospholipids, proteins, and cholesterol, floating in a fluid-like mosaic. This structure allows the membrane to be both flexible and selective in what it allows to pass through. Understanding the fluid mosaic model is essential in understanding how the cell membrane functions and responds to different conditions.\n\n@@@Practicing Questions\nTo better understand the structure and function of the cell membrane, you can practice answering questions related to it. This can include naming molecules present in animal cell membranes and explaining the effects of cholesterol on the cell membrane.\n\n@@@Exam Questions\nIn exams, you may be asked to apply your knowledge of the cell membrane to analyze data and draw conclusions. This can involve suggesting suitable methods for obtaining results, as well as interpreting and explaining the results themselves. ","16":" 38Exchange Across Cell Membranes \u2014 Diffusion\n\nDiffusion as Passive Movement of Particles\n@@@Diffusion\nDiffusion is the net movement of particles (molecules or ions) from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Molecules will diffuse both ways, but the net movement will be to the area of lower concentration. This continues until particles are evenly distributed throughout the liquid or gas. The concentration gradient is the path from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Particles diffuse down a concentration gradient. Furthermore, diffusion is a passive process, meaning no energy is needed for it to happen. This makes diffusion an efficient means of transporting substances across cell membranes.\n\nFacilitated Diffusion Using Carrier Proteins and Protein Channels\n@@@Facilitated Diffusion\nSome substances, such as larger molecules like amino acids and glucose, and charged particles, would diffuse extremely slowly through the phospholipid bilayer due to their size or water solubility. As such, facilitated diffusion is employed to speed up the process. In facilitated diffusion, large or charged particles diffuse through carrier proteins or channel proteins in the membrane, moving down a concentration gradient from a higher to a lower concentration. Similar to simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion is also a passive process that does not require energy.\n\nCarrier Proteins and Their Role in Facilitated Diffusion\n@@@Carrier Proteins\nLarge molecules are transported across cell membranes through carrier proteins. These proteins facilitate the diffusion of different molecules and are specific to the type of molecule they transport. The process begins when a large molecule attaches to a carrier protein in the membrane. This causes the protein to change shape, releasing the molecule on the opposite side of the membrane.\n\nChannel Proteins and Their Role in Facilitated Diffusion\n@@@Channel Proteins\nFor charged particles, channel proteins are responsible for facilitating diffusion across cell membranes. These proteins form pores in the membrane, allowing charged particles to pass through and move down their concentration gradient. Similar to carrier proteins, different channel proteins facilitate the diffusion of specific types of charged particles. This process is crucial for maintaining the balance of ions and other charged substances in the cell.","17":" 39Exchange Across Cell Membranes \u2014 Diffusion \n\n@@@Introduction\nDiffusion is a passive process that allows molecules or substances to move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. This process is essential for the exchange of molecules across both external and internal cell membranes. However, the rate of diffusion can vary depending on various factors.\n\n@@@Factors Affecting the Rate of Diffusion\nThe rate of diffusion depends on several factors, including the concentration gradient, thickness of the exchange surface, and surface area. These factors can affect the speed at which molecules diffuse across a membrane.\n\n@@@Concentration Gradient\nThe concentration gradient is the difference in concentration between the two sides of the membrane. The higher the concentration gradient, the faster the rate of diffusion. As diffusion takes place, this gradient decreases until an equilibrium is reached, and the rate of diffusion slows down over time.\n\n@@@Thickness of the Exchange Surface\nThe thickness of the exchange surface, or the distance the particles have to travel, also plays a role in the rate of diffusion. The thinner the exchange surface, the faster the rate of diffusion. This means that shorter distances between the two sides of the membrane result in faster diffusion.\n\n@@@Surface Area\nThe surface area of the exchange surface, such as the cell-surface membrane, is also a determining factor for the rate of diffusion. A larger surface area allows for more particles to be exchanged, increasing the rate of diffusion. Some cells, like epithelial cells in the small intestine, have adaptations such as microvilli that increase their surface area.\n\n@@@Microvilli and Surface Area\nMicrovilli are projections formed by the cell-surface membrane and give the cell a larger surface area. In human cells, microvilli can increase the surface area by about 600 times, allowing for more particles to be exchanged in the same amount of time. This increase in surface area results in a higher rate of diffusion.\n\n@@@Types of Diffusion\nThere are two types of diffusion: simple and facilitated. Both types rely on the factors mentioned above, but there are specific factors that affect each type differently.\n\n@@@Simple Diffusion\nSimple diffusion is the movement of small, non-polar molecules, such as oxygen, across the membrane. It depends on the concentration gradient, thickness of the exchange surface, and surface area.\n\n@@@Facilitated Diffusion\nFacilitated diffusion is the movement of larger or charged molecules across the membrane with the help of channel or carrier proteins. The factors that affect the rate of facilitated diffusion are slightly different.\n\n@@@Number of Channel or Carrier Proteins\nThe number of channel or carrier proteins in the membrane affects the rate of facilitated diffusion. Once all the proteins are in use, diffusion cannot occur any faster, even if the concentration gradient increases. Therefore, the higher the number of proteins, the faster the rate of facilitated diffusion.\n\n@@@Aquaporins\nAquaporins are special channel proteins that allow the facilitated diffusion of water across the membrane. These proteins can be found in some kidney cells, allowing them to reabsorb a large amount of water that would otherwise be excreted by the body.\n\n@@@Calculating the Rate of Diffusion\nIn exams, students may be asked to calculate the rate of diffusion from a graph. For a straight line graph, this means finding the gradient of the line. For a curved graph, students must draw a tangent and find the gradient of the tangent. These techniques are essential for understanding the rate of diffusion.\n\n@@@Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the rate of diffusion across cell membranes depends on various factors, including the concentration gradient, thickness of the exchange surface, and surface area. Understanding these factors is crucial for comprehending the process of diffusion and its importance in cellular exchange.","18":" 40 Exchange Across Cell Membranes \u2014 Osmosis\nOsmosis is the diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane, from an area of higher water potential to an area of lower water potential. This section discusses the process of osmosis and its importance in cell function. \n\n@@@Water Potential and Solutions \nWater potential is the potential, or likelihood, of water molecules to diffuse out of or into a solution. Pure water has the highest water potential, while all solutions have a lower water potential than pure water. If two solutions have the same water potential, they are isotonic. \n\n@@@Factors Affecting the Rate of Osmosis \nSimilar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis is influenced by several factors. These include the water potential gradient, the thickness and surface area of the exchange surface, and the properties of the membrane. \n\n@@@The Rate of Osmosis Depends on Several Factors \nThe factors affecting the rate of osmosis are similar to those influencing the rate of diffusion (see previous page). The higher the water potential gradient, the faster the rate of osmosis. Additionally, the thinner and larger the exchange surface, the faster the rate of osmosis. As osmosis occurs, the difference in water potential decreases and the rate of osmosis levels off. \n\n@@@Water Potential Experiments \nTo investigate water potential, you can conduct experiments using serial dilutions. These experiments can be done using plant tissue, such as potato cylinders, and solutions of known concentrations. A serial dilution technique can be used to create several solutions of different concentrations. \n\n@@@Serial Dilution Technique \nTo perform a serial dilution, follow these steps: \n1. Line up five test tubes in a rack. \n2. Add 10 cm3 of the initial solution to the first test tube and 5 cm3 of distilled water to the other four test tubes. \n3. Using a pipette, transfer 5 cm3 of the solution from the first test tube to the second and mix thoroughly. \n4. Repeat this process with each subsequent test tube, creating solutions of decreasing concentration.","19":" 42Exchange Across Cell Membranes \u2014 Active Transport\n\n@@@Introduction\nDiffusion and osmosis are passive processes that do not require energy. However, there is another type of transport called active transport that does require energy to move molecules and ions across cell membranes. In this section, we will discuss the process of active transport and its main differences from passive transport.\n\n@@@Active Transport Requires Energy\nUnlike passive transport, active transport uses energy to move solutes across membranes, usually against a concentration gradient. This type of transport is essential for maintaining the proper balance of molecules and ions within cells.\n\n@@@Carrier Proteins and Active Transport\nActive transport involves carrier proteins that are responsible for moving molecules and ions across the membrane. This process is similar to facilitated diffusion, where a molecule attaches to a carrier protein and is transported across the membrane. However, there are two main differences between active transport and facilitated diffusion.\n\n@@@Difference #1: Concentration Gradient\nOne main difference is that active transport usually moves solutes from a low to a high concentration, while facilitated diffusion moves them in the opposite direction. This means that active transport can move molecules and ions against their concentration gradient.\n\n@@@Difference #2: Energy Requirement\nAnother main difference is that active transport requires energy, while facilitated diffusion does not. The most common source of energy for active transport in cells is ATP, which is produced through cellular respiration.\n\n@@@ATP and Active Transport\nATP undergoes a hydrolysis reaction, breaking down into ADP and inorganic phosphate. This release of energy is used to power the movement of solutes across the membrane during active transport.\n\n@@@Co-Transporters\nCo-transporters are a specific type of carrier protein that can bind two molecules at a time. They use the concentration gradient of one molecule to move the other molecule against its own concentration gradient. The diagram of co-transport of sodium ions and glucose illustrates this process.\n\n@@@Factors Affecting the Rate of Active Transport\nSeveral factors can affect the rate of active transport. These include the speed of individual carrier proteins, the number of carrier proteins present, and the rate of respiration in the cell. If respiration is inhibited, active transport cannot take place. These factors are further discussed on the next page.","20":" 44Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n@@@The Immune System  \nThe immune system is the body's defense mechanism against infectious diseases caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. It is made up of an army of cells that work together to protect us. \n\nForeign Antigens Trigger an Immune Response  \nAntigens are molecules, usually proteins, that trigger an immune response when they are detected by the body. Antigens are typically found on the surface of cells and are used by the immune system to identify pathogens, abnormal body cells, toxins, and cells from other individuals of the same species. \n\n@@@The Four Stages of the Immune Response  \nThe immune response has four main stages: phagocytosis, T-cell activation, B-cell activation, and antibody production. Each stage involves different types of white blood cells and their specific functions. \n\n@@@Phagocytes Engulf Pathogens  \nPhagocytes are a type of white blood cell that carries out phagocytosis, the process of engulfing and destroying pathogens. Found in the blood and tissues, phagocytes are the first cells to respond to an immune system trigger. The steps of phagocytosis include recognition, engulfment, fusion with lysosomes, and antigen presentation. \n\n@@@Phagocytes Activate T-cells  \nT-cells, also known as T-lymphocytes, are another type of white blood cell that plays a role in the immune response. T-cells have receptor proteins on their surface that bind to complementary antigens presented by phagocytes. This activates the T-cell, which triggers different responses depending on the type of T-cell. \n\n@@@T-cells Activate B-cells, Which Divide into Plasma Cells  \nB-cells, also called B-lymphocytes, are a type of white blood cell that produce antibodies. When an activated T-cell meets a complementary shaped antigen, it activates the B-cell through a process called clonal selection. The B-cell then divides into plasma cells. \n\n@@@Plasma Cells Make More Antibodies to a Specific Antigen  \nPlasma cells are clones of B-cells that produce large amounts of antibodies specific to an antigen. These antibodies bind to the antigen and form antigen-antibody complexes, leading to agglutination and eventual destruction of the pathogen. Antibodies are proteins made up of amino acid chains, and their specificity is determined by their unique variable regions. ","21":" 46Immunity and Vaccines\n\n@@@Introduction\nImmunity and vaccines are essential aspects of our body's defense against diseases. When our bodies encounter a pathogen, they initiate a response to fight it off and develop immunity against it. Vaccines play a crucial role in this process by stimulating the production of memory cells without causing the disease itself.\n\n@@@Primary Response and Immunity\nThe primary response is our body's initial defense against a pathogen. It involves the action of B-cells, which divide and produce antibodies to fight off the invading pathogen. However, this response only results in immunity after the disease has been contracted.\n\n@@@Vaccines and Protection\nVaccines work as a preventive measure by providing antigens that trigger the production of memory cells against a specific pathogen. This allows for immunity to develop without actually getting infected and experiencing any symptoms.\n\n@@@Herd Immunity\nApart from protecting individuals, vaccines also have a positive effect on the population as a whole. By reducing the incidence of a disease, they indirectly protect those who are not vaccinated through herd immunity. This is because there are fewer people carrying the disease and therefore less chance for it to spread.\n\n@@@Different Forms of Vaccines\nVaccines can come in different forms, including injections and oral doses. While both are effective, oral vaccines may face obstacles in terms of breaking down in the gut or being too large to be absorbed into the blood.\n\n@@@Booster Vaccines\nIn some cases, booster vaccines are necessary to ensure proper production of memory cells. These are often given later on, after a certain amount of time has passed, to maintain long-term immunity.\n\n@@@Antigenic Variation and Evasion\nSome pathogens have the ability to evade the immune system by constantly changing their surface antigens. This is known as antigenic variation, which poses a challenge for the development of vaccines against these pathogens.\n\n@@@Implications of Antigenic Variation\nDue to antigenic variation, the effectiveness of vaccines against certain pathogens may vary. For example, influenza (flu) vaccines need to be updated every year to target new strains of the virus with different surface antigens.\n\n@@@The Role of Vaccines in Influenza Prevention\nEvery year, a new influenza vaccine is developed to target the most prevalent strains of the virus. This is necessary because the antigens on the surface of influenza viruses change regularly, resulting in different strains each year.\n\n@@@Conclusion\nIn summary, vaccines play a vital role in stimulating the production of memory cells and providing immunity without causing the disease itself. However, the process can be complicated by antigenic variation in some pathogens, making it necessary for vaccines to be updated to remain effective in preventing diseases.

In this subsection, we will discuss the different types of carbohydrates, their structures, and their roles in biological systems.\n\n@@@title 4.1\nPolysaccharides: Loads of Sugars Joined Together\n\nPolysaccharides are complex carbohydrates that are formed when several monosaccharides are linked together through condensation reactions. These molecules can be composed of hundreds or thousands of monosaccharide units, making them much larger than monosaccharides and disaccharides.\n\n@@@title 4.2\nThe Relationship between Structure and Function of Polysaccharides\n\nIn order to understand the function of polysaccharides in living organisms, it is important to consider their structure. Three important polysaccharides, starch, glycogen, and cellulose, will be discussed in detail below.\n\n@@@title 4.3\nStarch: The Main Energy Storage Material in Plants\n\nStarch is the main energy storage molecule in plants. It is composed of two types of polysaccharides, amylose and amylopectin, both made up of alpha-glucose monomers.\n\n@@@title 4.3.1\nAmylose: The Coiled Structure\n\nAmylose is a long, unbranched chain of alpha-glucose molecules connected by glycosidic bonds. The angles of these bonds give amylose a coiled structure, making it very compact and efficient for storage within cells.\n\n@@@title 4.3.2\nAmylopectin: The Branched Structure\n\nIn contrast, amylopectin is a long, branched chain of alpha-glucose molecules. The side branches allow enzymes to easily access the glycosidic bonds, making the release of glucose molecules quick and efficient.\n\n@@@title 4.3.3\nStarch's Insolubility and Water Potential\n\nStarch is insoluble in water and has no effect on the water potential of cells. This property is important for storage because it prevents water from entering the cell through osmosis, which could cause cell swelling.\n\n@@@title 4.4\nThe Iodine Test for Starch\n\nThe iodine test is used to determine the presence of starch in a sample. By adding iodine dissolved in potassium iodide solution, a sample containing starch will turn from a brown-orange color to a dark, blue-black color.\n\n@@@title 4.5\nGlycogen: The Main Energy Storage Material in Animals\n\nSimilar to starch in plants, glycogen serves as the main energy storage molecule in animals. It is composed of alpha-glucose monomers and has a similar structure to amylopectin, but with even more side branches.\n\n@@@title 4.5.1\nThe Importance of Branching for Energy Release\n\nThe numerous side branches in glycogen allow for quick and efficient release of glucose molecules, which is necessary for rapid energy release in animals.\n\n@@@title 4.5.2\nCompactness for Storage\n\nGlycogen also has a compact structure, making it an ideal molecule for long-term storage of excess glucose in animal cells.\n\n@@@title 4.5.3\nGlycogen Depletion in Exercise\n\nAfter prolonged physical activity, animals may deplete their glycogen stores. This can be seen in the story of Chappy and Stuart, who finally ran out of glycogen after playing fetch 312 times.\n\n@@@title 4.6\nTopic 1A - Biological Molecules: Carbohydrates\n\nIn conclusion, carbohydrates play essential roles in biological systems, from energy storage to cellular structure and communication. Understanding the structure and function of carbohydrates, including polysaccharides like starch and glycogen, is crucial to fully grasp the complex processes of life.","23":" 48Antibodies in Medicine\n@@@Introduction\nAntibodies play a vital role in the human immune system, fighting off infections and preventing diseases. However, their usefulness extends beyond just fighting off infections. In medicine, antibodies have proven to be valuable tools for diagnostic purposes and drug development.\n\n@@@Monoclonal Antibodies can be used to Target Specific Substances or Cells\nMonoclonal antibodies are unique antibodies that are produced from a single group of genetically identical B-cells, also known as plasma cells. This means that they all have the same structure and can be used for targeted purposes. Due to their specific binding sites, antibodies are highly selective and can bind to certain antigens or substances in the body. This allows for the development of monoclonal antibodies that can specifically target and bind to a particular substance or cell.\n\n@@@Targeting drugs to a particular cell type \u2014 cancer cells\nOne of the most significant applications of monoclonal antibodies in medicine is for targeting drugs to specific cells, such as cancer cells. Different cells in the body have unique surface antigens, and cancer cells have additional antigens called tumor markers that are not found on normal body cells. Monoclonal antibodies can be designed to bind specifically to these tumor markers, and drugs can be attached to the antibodies. This targeted approach ensures that the drug only accumulates in the body near cancer cells, reducing the risk of side effects and increasing the drug's effectiveness.\n\n@@@Targeting a particular substance for medical diagnosis \u2014 pregnancy testing\nMonoclonal antibodies are also used in medical diagnosis, such as in pregnancy tests. These tests detect the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the urine of pregnant women. The application area of the test contains antibodies for hCG bound to colored beads. When urine is applied, any hCG present will bind to the antibody on the beads, forming an antigen-antibody complex. The urine then moves up the stick to a test strip that contains immobilized antibodies to hCG. If hCG is present, the test strip will turn blue due to the increased concentration of the hCG-antibody complex. This targeted testing method allows for accurate and efficient diagnosis of pregnancy.\n\n@@@Conclusion\nIn conclusion, antibodies play a crucial role in medicine, not just as a part of our immune system but also as essential tools for targeted drug delivery and medical diagnosis. Further research and developments in the use of antibodies in medicine can lead to more effective treatments and diagnostic tools for various diseases and conditions.","24":" 52HIV and Viruses\n\n@@@ Introduction \nThis section will cover the basics of viruses and their effects on the human body, with a focus on HIV and its structure, replication, and effects on the immune system.\n\n@@@ Viruses vs Bacteria\nViruses are different from bacteria in that they are not living organisms and can only reproduce inside the cells of a host organism. In contrast, bacteria are single-celled organisms that can reproduce on their own. While some bacteria can cause disease, all viruses are known to cause disease.\n\n@@@ HIV and AIDS\nHIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks and weakens the immune system. It can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is a condition where the immune system is severely weakened and unable to fight off other infections. This makes an individual with AIDS more susceptible to other illnesses, such as pneumonia.\n\n@@@ Role of Helper T-cells\nHIV primarily infects and eventually kills helper T-cells, which are an essential part of the immune system. These cells send chemical signals that activate other immune cells, such as phagocytes, cytotoxic T-cells, and B-cells. Without enough helper T-cells, the immune system is unable to mount an effective response to infections.\n\n@@@ HIV Structure\nHIV has a spherical structure that consists of four main parts. These include a core containing genetic material (RNA) and proteins, a protein coating called a capsid, an outer layer made of stolen membrane from host cells, and attachment proteins that help the virus attach to host cells.\n\n@@@ HIV Replication Process\nHIV, like all other viruses, can only replicate inside the cells of the organism it has infected. It uses the host cell's enzymes and ribosomes to replicate. The replication process involves attaching to the host cell, releasing its genetic material, using reverse transcriptase to make DNA from RNA, inserting the viral DNA into the host cell's DNA, using host enzymes to make viral proteins, and finally, assembling new viruses that can infect other cells.\n\n@@@ Initial Infection and Latency Period\nDuring the initial infection period, HIV replicates rapidly, and the individual may experience severe flu-like symptoms. After this period, HIV replication drops to a lower level, and the individual enters a latency period that can last for years. During this period, the person may not experience any symptoms, but the virus is still actively replicating inside the body.","25":"@@@Topic 3A: Exchange and Transport Systems\nSize and Surface Area\n\n@@@Introduction\nExchanging essential substances with the environment is crucial for the survival of all organisms, from single-celled organisms to complex multicellular organisms. However, the process of exchanging substances becomes more complicated as organisms increase in size due to the surface area to volume ratio.\n\n@@@Importance of Exchanging Substances\nAll organisms, regardless of their size, require the exchange of substances with their environment. This includes taking in oxygen and nutrients, as well as excreting waste products. In order to maintain homeostasis, many organisms also need to regulate their temperature and thus require heat exchange.\n\n@@@ Surface Area to Volume Ratio \nThe ease of exchanging substances is affected by an organism's surface area to volume ratio. Smaller animals have a higher ratio compared to larger animals, making it easier for them to exchange substances.\n\n@@@Surface Area to Volume Ratio Demonstration\nA mathematical comparison between a mouse and a hippo helps visualize the significant difference in surface area to volume ratio between smaller and larger animals. Representing the animals as cubes, it is evident that the hippo's surface area is only twice its volume, while the mouse's surface area is six times its volume.\n\n@@@Multicellular Organisms and the Need for Exchange Organs \nIn multicellular organisms, simple diffusion across the cell membrane is insufficient due to the distance between cells and the outer environment. Additionally, larger animals have a low surface area to volume ratio, making it difficult to exchange enough substances through their outer surface. Therefore, multicellular animals require specialized exchange organs such as lungs to assist in the exchange of substances.\n\n@@@Mass Transport in Multicellular Organisms \nIn addition to exchange organs, multicellular organisms also need an efficient mass transport system to carry substances to and from individual cells. In mammals, this is accomplished through the circulatory system, while in plants, the xylem and phloem are responsible for transporting water and solutes. Mass transport is crucial for the distribution of essential substances and the removal of waste products.","26":" 56Gas Exchange\n \nGas exchange is a vital process for many organisms, as it allows them to obtain oxygen for cellular respiration and release carbon dioxide as a waste product. However, in order to maintain a suitable balance of gases, organisms must also prevent excessive water loss. This involves certain adaptations to their gas exchange surfaces and methods of gas transport.\n \n@@@Adaptations for Efficient Gas Exchange Surfaces\n \nMany organisms have evolved adaptations to improve their rate of gas exchange. However, for insects and plants, this can be particularly challenging due to the risk of water loss. Thus, their gas exchange surfaces have two major adaptations that allow for efficient gas exchange without excessive dehydration.\nFirstly, these surfaces have a large surface area, providing more opportunity for gases to diffuse in and out. Secondly, they are thin, often consisting of only one layer of epithelial cells, which reduces the distance for diffusion to occur. This short diffusion pathway, along with the maintenance of steep concentration gradients, all contribute to increasing the rate of diffusion.\nAdditionally, plants and insects use other methods to regulate water loss, such as opening and closing their stomata or using specialized structures like tracheae and stomata to transport gases.\n \n@@@Gas Exchange in Single-celled Organisms\n \nWhile some organisms have complex gas exchange systems, single-celled organisms rely on their body surfaces for gas exchange. Due to their small size, these organisms have a relatively large surface area-to-volume ratio, allowing for efficient diffusion of gases through their outer surface. This eliminates the need for a specialized gas exchange system.\nFurthermore, their thin surface and short diffusion pathway, along with a rapid rate of biochemical reactions, facilitate the exchange of gases. Since these organisms do not have specialized transport systems, gases can freely diffuse in and out of the cell.\n \n@@@Counter-Current System in Fish\n \nFish, being aquatic organisms, face the challenge of extracting oxygen from water, which has a lower concentration of oxygen than air. To overcome this, fish have developed a specialized gas exchange system that utilizes a counter-current system.\nWater containing oxygen enters through the fish's mouth and flows over the gills, which consist of thin plates called gill filaments. These filaments are covered in lamellae, further increasing the surface area for gas exchange. The lamellae have a network of blood capillaries and a thin surface layer of cells to facilitate gas exchange through diffusion.\nIn this system, blood flows through the lamellae in one direction, while water flows over them in the opposite direction. This maintains a large concentration gradient between the water and the blood, allowing for efficient diffusion of oxygen into the bloodstream.\n \n@@@Tracheal System in Insects\n \nInsects have developed a different strategy for gas exchange, known as the tracheal system. They have microscopic air-filled tubes called tracheae that serve as their gas exchange organs. The tracheae connect to small tubes called tracheoles, which allow for gas exchange with individual cells.\nAir enters the tracheae through small pores on the body surface called spiracles, and oxygen diffuses towards the cells down a concentration gradient. Similarly, carbon dioxide leaves the cells and diffuses towards the spiracles to be released into the atmosphere. Insects use rhythmic abdominal movements to circulate air into and out of the tracheae, ensuring a constant supply of oxygen for cellular respiration. The tracheal system, along with the thin and permeable walls of the tracheoles, reduces the diffusion distance for gases and allows for efficient gas exchange without the need for specialized transport systems.","27":" 58Gas Exchange in Humans\nHuman Gas Exchange System Structure and Function@@@Lungs: Specialized Organs for Gas Exchange\nGas exchange is a vital process for humans, as it involves the transfer of oxygen into the bloodstream for respiration and the removal of carbon dioxide produced by cells. This exchange takes place in the specialized organs of the lungs. \n@@@Structure of the Lungs\nThe lungs are complex structures that are responsible for gas exchange in humans. They are made up of smaller units called lobes, which are further divided into lobules. Each lobule contains tiny sacs called alveoli, where gas exchange occurs. \n@@@Ventilation: Breathing in and out\nIn order for gas exchange to take place, humans must breathe in and out. Ventilation is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs, and it is controlled by the movements of the diaphragm, intercostal muscles, and ribcage. \n@@@Inspiration: Breathing in\nDuring inspiration, the external intercostal and diaphragm muscles contract. This causes the ribcage to move outwards and upwards while the diaphragm flattens, creating more space in the thoracic cavity. As a result, the lung pressure decreases, causing air to flow into the lungs. \n@@@Expiration: Breathing out\nExpiration is the process of breathing out and is a passive process that does not require energy. During expiration, the external intercostal and diaphragm muscles relax, causing the ribcage to move downwards and inwards. This decreases the volume of the thoracic cavity, increasing the air pressure and forcing air out of the lungs. \n@@@Forced Expiration\nIn some cases, expiration can be forced, such as when blowing out candles. This is achieved by contracting the internal intercostal muscles, which pull the ribcage further down and inward, creating an even greater decrease in thoracic cavity volume and increase in air pressure. This movement is called antagonistic because it opposes the movements of the external intercostal muscles during inspiration.","28":"@@@ The Effects of Lung Disease\n \nLung Function Tests and Their Importance for Diagnosing Lung Diseases:\nThere are several important measures of lung function that doctors use to diagnose lung diseases, including Tidal Volume, Ventilation Rate, Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1), and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). These measurements provide crucial information about how well the lungs are functioning and can help doctors determine the presence and severity of a lung disease. When studying lung diseases, it is important to understand and be able to interpret these measures of lung function.\n\n@@@ Different Diseases and Their Effects on Breathing:\n\nLung diseases can affect breathing in various ways, depending on the specific disease. Here are some examples of different lung diseases and how they impact breathing:\n\n1) Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB):\nTB is a bacterial infection that can damage the lungs and lead to difficulty breathing. Here are some ways that TB affects breathing:\n\n- Formation of Tubercles: When infected with TB bacteria, the immune system creates a barrier around the bacteria, forming small, hard lumps called tubercles in the lungs. These tubercles can damage the gaseous exchange surface, reducing tidal volume.\n\n- Fibrosis: TB can also cause fibrosis, which is the formation of scar tissue in the lungs. Scar tissue is thicker and less elastic than normal lung tissue, making it difficult for the lungs to expand and hold enough air. This leads to a reduction in tidal volume and forced vital capacity (FVC).\n\n- Increased Ventilation Rate: Due to the decrease in tidal volume, patients with TB have to breathe faster to take in enough oxygen. This leads to an increased ventilation rate.\n\n- Common Symptoms: Some common symptoms of TB include a persistent cough, coughing up blood and mucus, chest pains, shortness of breath, and fatigue.\n\n2) Fibrosis:\nFibrosis is the formation of scar tissue in the lungs, which can be caused by infections or exposure to substances like asbestos or dust. Here are some effects of fibrosis on breathing:\n\n- Reduction in Tidal Volume and FVC: Scar tissue is thicker and less elastic than normal lung tissue, making it difficult for the lungs to expand and hold enough air. This results in a decrease in tidal volume and FVC.\n\n- Slower Diffusion: The scarred tissue also makes it harder for gases to diffuse across the membrane, slowing down the rate of gaseous exchange.\n\n- Symptoms: Some symptoms of fibrosis include shortness of breath, dry cough, chest pain, fatigue, and weakness.\n\n- Increased Ventilation Rate: Similar to TB, fibrosis patients also have a higher ventilation rate to compensate for the decrease in tidal volume.\n\nIn conclusion, lung diseases can affect breathing in various ways, from reducing tidal volume and FVC to increasing ventilation rate. It is important for doctors to recognize these effects and conduct lung function tests to accurately diagnose and treat different lung diseases.

This requires various chemical reactions and enzymes. In this subsection, we will discuss how food is broken down, the use of digestive enzymes, and the breakdown of specific molecules such as carbohydrates and lipids.\n\n@@@title\nBreaking Down Large Biological Molecules\nThe large biological molecules found in food, such as starch and proteins, are too large to be absorbed by cells. Therefore, during digestion, these large molecules are broken down into smaller molecules that can be easily absorbed by cells. This process involves hydrolysis reactions, where water is added to break bonds.\n\n@@@title\nEnzymes for Digestion\nSpecialized cells in the digestive system produce a variety of digestive enzymes that are then released into the gut to mix with food. These enzymes are specific to different substrates, meaning that different enzymes are needed to break down different food molecules.\n\n@@@title\nCarbohydrate Digestion\nOne of the main substances that need to be broken down during digestion is carbohydrates. Amylase is the enzyme responsible for breaking down starch into the smaller sugar maltose. This enzyme is produced in both the salivary glands and the pancreas. Membrane-bound disaccharidases are also present in the cells lining the small intestine, which help to break down disaccharides into monosaccharides.\n\n@@@title\nMonosaccharide Transport\nMonosaccharides, the simplest form of carbohydrates, can be transported across the cell membranes of epithelial cells in the small intestine with the help of specific transporter proteins.\n\n@@@title\nLipid Digestion and Absorption\nLipids are another important substance that needs to be broken down during digestion. Lipase enzymes, produced in the pancreas, catalyze the breakdown of lipids into monoglycerides and fatty acids. Bile salts, produced by the liver, play a crucial role in this process by emulsifying lipids, increasing their surface area for lipases to work on. Once broken down, lipids form tiny structures called micelles, which can be easily absorbed by cells. ","31":" 68\nHaemoglobin\n\n@@@Introduction\nHaemoglobin is a crucial protein in the body that is responsible for carrying oxygen. However, the structure and function of haemoglobin can vary between different species and affect the efficiency of oxygen transport. In this section, we will explore the structure of haemoglobin and how it contributes to oxygen transport in the body.\n\nHaemoglobin's Structure and Function\nHaemoglobin is a large protein with a unique quaternary structure, composed of four polypeptide chains. Each chain contains a haem group, which is crucial for oxygen binding. The haem group contains an iron ion and gives haemoglobin its characteristic red color. Haemoglobin has a high affinity for oxygen and can carry up to four oxygen molecules per molecule.\n\nOxygen Transport by Haemoglobin\nWhen oxygen enters the body through the lungs, it binds to haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin. This reaction is reversible, meaning that when oxygen is released in tissues, haemoglobin reverts to its original form. This allows haemoglobin to efficiently carry oxygen to cells that need it for respiration.\n\nHaemoglobin in Different Organisms\nHaemoglobin is not unique to vertebrates and can be found in various organisms, including earthworms, starfish, insects, plants, and bacteria. Even though these different types of haemoglobin may have slight chemical variations, they all serve the same purpose of oxygen transport.\n\nHaemoglobin Saturation and Partial Pressure of Oxygen\nThe saturation of haemoglobin with oxygen depends on the partial pressure of oxygen, which is a measure of oxygen concentration. In the lungs, the high partial pressure of oxygen allows for efficient oxygen loading onto haemoglobin. On the other hand, in respiring tissues where oxygen is used up, the lower partial pressure of oxygen prompts haemoglobin to release oxygen.\n\nDissociation Curves and Affinity for Oxygen\nA dissociation curve is a graphical representation of how saturated haemoglobin is with oxygen at varying partial pressures of oxygen. This curve has a distinct \"S\" shape due to the changes in haemoglobin's shape as oxygen binds to it. This allows for easy oxygen binding in high partial pressure conditions and efficient oxygen release in low partial pressure conditions.\n\nThe Dissociation Curve for Human Haemoglobin\nFor human haemoglobin, the dissociation curve shows a steep increase in oxygen saturation in high partial pressures of oxygen, followed by a gradual decrease at low partial pressures. This is due to the high affinity of human haemoglobin for oxygen, making it an efficient oxygen transporter.\n\nConclusion\nHaemoglobin plays a vital role in oxygen transport in the body, and its structure and function have evolved to adapt to specific environmental conditions. The relationship between haemoglobin saturation and partial pressure of oxygen is crucial in maintaining efficient oxygen transport, making it a crucial protein in many organisms. ","32":" 70The Circulatory System\n\nThe Role of the Circulatory System@@@\n\nThe circulatory system is a crucial part of most multicellular organisms, such as mammals, insects, and fish. It serves as a mass transport system for circulating blood to different parts of the body. This subsection will discuss the function and structure of the circulatory system in more detail.\n\nSpecialized Transport System for Multicellular Organisms@@@\nAs discussed, most multicellular organisms have a relatively low surface area to volume ratio. Therefore, they require a specialized transport system to carry essential raw materials from specialized exchange organs to body cells. This is where the circulatory system comes into play.\n\nComponents of the Circulatory System@@@\nThe circulatory system comprises the heart and blood vessels. The heart is responsible for pumping blood through various blood vessels, including arteries, arterioles, veins, and capillaries, to reach different parts of the body. It is crucial to know the names of these blood vessels as they serve different functions in the circulatory system.\n\nTwo Circuits of the Circulatory System@@@\nThe circulatory system consists of two loops or circuits. The first one is the pulmonary circuit, which takes blood from the heart to the lungs and back to the heart. The second loop, known as the systemic circuit, distributes blood to the rest of the body. It is essential to note that the heart has its own blood supply \u2013 the left and right coronary arteries \u2013 to keep it functioning properly.\n\nDifferent Functions of Blood Vessels@@@\nArteries, arterioles, and veins are three types of blood vessels with specific characteristics that serve different functions in the circulatory system. In this subsection, we will discuss how each of these vessels is adapted for its function.\n\nArteries: High-Pressure Transport System@@@\nArteries carry oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body. The walls of arteries are thick and contain elastic tissue that allows them to stretch and recoil as the heart beats, maintaining high-pressure blood flow. The inner lining of arteries is folded, enabling the artery to stretch and maintain high pressure. However, pulmonary arteries are an exception as they carry deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs.\n\nArterioles: Fine-Tuning Blood Flow@@@\nArterioles are smaller vessels that branch out from arteries, forming a network throughout the body. These vessels regulate blood flow to different areas of the body by contracting or relaxing specific muscles inside them, depending on the demand for oxygenated blood.\n\nVeins: Low-Pressure Transport System@@@\nVeins transport deoxygenated blood from the body back to the heart under low pressure. They have a wider lumen and lesser elastic and muscle tissue compared to arteries. Moreover, veins contain valves to prevent blood from flowing backward. The contraction of the surrounding body muscles also helps in blood flow through veins.\n\nConclusion@@@\nThe circulatory system is a significant transport system that is essential for the proper functioning of multicellular organisms. It comprises the heart and different types of blood vessels that perform specific functions to carry blood throughout the body. ","33":" 8Proteins\nProteins, macromolecules with many functions, are made up of long chains of amino acids. They have a complex structure with four main levels, which grants them a great variety in forms and properties.\n\n@@@Definitions\nProteins are Made from Long Chains of Amino Acids. These basic constituents join together to form polypeptide chains, and one or more such chains can constitute a protein molecule. The comments made by Grant, fictional protein-phobe, remind us that although these chains share the same structure, it is what forms their R group that makes them distinct.\n\n@@@Molecular Structure\nAmino acids, as the name implies, are composed of an amine group (-NH2), a carboxyl group (-COOH), and an R group which varies between different amino acids. This molecular structure is the same for all proteins, with the R group - the variable group - being the only differentiator between the 20 essential amino acids.\n\n@@@Chain Formation \nPolypeptides are Formed by Condensation Reactions. The process of combining amino acids into a polypeptide chain involves releasing a molecule of water and forming peptide bonds. While Glycine doesn't have carbon in its R group, it is the unique structure of its side group that differentiates it from all others. Following condensation, the reverse reaction occurs in digestion: hydrolysis of the peptide bond.\n\n@@@Protein Structure\nProteins Have Four Structural Levels. These levels determine the conformation of the protein, as well as its functional properties.\n\n@@@Primary Structure\nPrimary Structure, the first level, is the ordering of amino acids along the polypeptide chain. Not only does this determine the protein's unique sequence of amino acids, but it also influences how the protein will behave.\n\n@@@Secondary Structure\nSecondary Structure, is determined by conformational structure, alpha (a) helix or beta ((3) pleated sheet. This results from hydrogen bonding between amino acids, causing the polypeptide chain to adopt a particular shape, which can range from coiled to folded.\n\n@@@Tertiary Structure\nTertiary Structure follows, where the secondary structure is further folded and coiled to create the final unique 3D structure. Different types of bonds, such as hydrogen and ionic bonds, contribute to stabilizing this structure. Additionally, for cysteine-containing proteins, disulfide bridges can form between amino acids in close proximity, adding to the structural diversity and stability.\n\n@@@Quaternary Structure\nQuaternary Structure, the final level, is only exhibited by proteins made up of more than one polypeptide chain. The way these chains are held together contributes to the protein's final unique 3D structure. Examples include haemoglobin, insulin, and collagen.","34":" 72The Heart@@@Structure and Function of the Heart\nThe heart is the vital organ responsible for pumping blood throughout the body to deliver oxygen and nutrients to cells. It is made up of two muscular pumps - the left and right sides - and has specific structures and functions to ensure efficient transportation of blood.\n \n@@@The Two Sides of the Heart\nThe diagram on the right depicts the internal structure of the heart, with the left and right sides reversed to match the person's perspective. The right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs, where it becomes oxygenated, while the left side pumps oxygenated blood to the rest of the body.\n\n@@@Veins and Arteries\nThe diagram serves as a helpful reminder that veins, such as the superior and inferior vena cava, carry blood into the heart, while arteries, like the pulmonary artery and aorta, carry blood away from it.\n\n@@@Distinct Roles of the Heart Chambers\nEach chamber of the heart is adapted to carry out its function effectively. The left ventricle, responsible for pumping oxygenated blood to the body, has thicker and more muscular walls compared to the right ventricle. The right ventricle, on the other hand, only needs to pump blood to the nearby lungs.\n\n@@@Valves in the Heart\nThe heart has two types of valves that prevent backflow of blood and ensure its unidirectional flow. The atrioventricular (AV) valves, located between the atria and ventricles, prevent blood from flowing back into the atria when the ventricles contract. The semi-lunar (SL) valves, found at the exit points of the ventricles, prevent blood from returning to the heart after the ventricles contract.\n\n@@@Role of Cords in the Heart\nThe cords, also known as valve tendons, play a crucial role in the heart's functioning by attaching the AV valves to the ventricles. This prevents the valves from being pushed up into the atria when the ventricles contract.\n\n@@@An Analogy to Understand Heart Valves\nCaptain Jeff compares the lock gates to a big heart valve, explaining that with enough pressure, he would be able to force his way through. Similar to the heart valves, lock gates only open one way depending on the relative pressure on either side.\n\n@@@How Pressure Regulates Heart Valve Function\nThe relative pressure in the heart chambers determines whether the valves are open or shut. If the pressure behind a valve is higher, it will be forced open; if the pressure in front is higher, it will be forced shut. This mechanism ensures the unidirectional flow of blood through the heart.","35":"\n@@@Introduction \nThe heart is a vital organ that plays a major role in maintaining the body's circulation system. Understanding the cardiac cycle and the changes in pressure and volume can help in interpreting data about the heart.\n\n@@@Interpreting Data on the Cardiac Cycle \nIn exams, you may come across data related to the changes in pressure and volume during the cardiac cycle. This data may be presented in various forms - graphs, diagrams, or tables. Knowing how to interpret this data is crucial in understanding the functioning of the heart.\n\n@@@Example 1: Graph \nThe first example given shows a graph with time on the x-axis and pressure on the y-axis. Questions may be asked about specific points on the graph, such as the time when blood starts flowing into the aorta, or the reason for ventricular volume decreasing at a certain point.\n\n@@@Example 2: Diagram \nThe second example involves a diagram showing the changes in pressure and volume during the cardiac cycle. In this case, questions may be related to identifying the stages of the cardiac cycle and describing the changes in pressure and volume at each stage.\n\n@@@Practice Questions \nTo test your understanding of the cardiac cycle, there are practice questions that may be asked. These questions can range from identifying the purpose of specific heart structures, to explaining the functions of different blood vessels.\n\n@@@Exam Question \nIn exams, more complex questions may be asked based on given data. This could involve interpreting a table showing the blood pressure in two heart chambers at different times during the cardiac cycle, and using that data to answer specific questions.\n\n@@@Introduction to More Exchange and Transport Systems \nThe heart is just one component of the body's complex system of exchange and transport. Understanding how various systems work together can provide a better understanding of the body's overall functioning.\n\n@@@The Cardiac Cycle - A Complex Pump-action Process \nThe cardiac cycle involves a series of events that take place in the heart to ensure the continuous flow of blood throughout the body. This process can seem complicated, with multiple stages and various pressure and volume changes.\n\n@@@Understand Pressure and Volume Changes \nTo truly grasp the concept of the cardiac cycle, it is important to understand the changes in pressure and volume that occur at each stage. These changes are crucial in ensuring proper blood flow and functioning of the heart.","36":" @@@Cardiovascular Disease \n Cardiovascular disease, also known as CVD, is a group of diseases that affect the heart and blood vessels. There are several risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease. These include lifestyle choices such as smoking and poor diet, as well as genetic factors.\n \n @@@Atheroma Formation and Its Role in CVD\nAtheroma formation is a key component in the development of cardiovascular disease. This process begins when the inner lining of an artery, called the endothelium, becomes damaged. Factors such as high blood pressure can contribute to this damage. When the endothelium is compromised, white blood cells and fats from the blood can accumulate under the lining, forming fatty streaks. Over time, these deposits can build up and harden, resulting in a fibrous plaque called an atheroma. These plaques partially block the artery, which can lead to increased blood pressure and the development of conditions such as coronary heart disease.\n \n @@@Atheromas and Their Effects on the Body \n In addition to contributing to the development of coronary heart disease, atheromas can also lead to other serious conditions. One such condition is an aneurysm, which occurs when the weakened artery wall balloons outwards due to the pressure of blood flow. If an aneurysm bursts, it can cause severe bleeding and potentially be fatal. Atheromas also increase the risk of thrombosis, which is the formation of a blood clot. If an atheroma ruptures, it can leave behind a rough surface that is prone to blood clot formation. These clots can block blood flow or break off and cause blockages in other parts of the body.\n \n @@@Myocardial Infarction and Its Causes \n When the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart become completely blocked, a myocardial infarction, or heart attack, can occur. This is because the heart muscle cells require oxygen from the blood to carry out respiration. Without oxygen, these cells can become damaged or die. A heart attack can be caused by atheromas or blood clots in the coronary arteries, cutting off blood flow to the heart muscle.\n \n @@@Symptoms and Consequences of Myocardial Infarction \nA myocardial infarction is a serious and life-threatening condition. The typical symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, and sweating. If a large area of the heart is affected, complete heart failure can occur, which can be fatal. Additionally, damage to the heart muscle can lead to long-term complications such as heart failure and arrhythmias. Prompt medical attention is critical in treating a heart attack and minimizing its consequences. ","37":" Cardiovascular Disease\n@@@Some Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease \nCardiovascular disease, also abbreviated as CVD, refers to a set of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. Some of the most common risk factors that increase a person's chances of developing this disease are explained below. \n\n@@@High Blood Cholesterol and Poor Diet \nBlood cholesterol level has been found to have a direct impact on the risk of cardiovascular disease. If the level of blood cholesterol in an individual is high, which is considered to be above 240 mg per 100 cm3, then the risk of developing CVD is increased. This is because cholesterol is one of the major components of the fatty deposits that form atheromas, which are fatty deposits in the arteries. Atheromas can cause increased blood pressure and blood clots, which can block the flow of blood to coronary arteries and result in a heart attack, also known as a myocardial infarction.\n\nHigh levels of cholesterol in the blood are often a result of a diet high in saturated fats. This is because saturated fats are known to increase the levels of cholesterol in the blood. Another contributing factor to high cholesterol levels is a diet high in salt, which is also linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease because it can lead to high blood pressure. \n\n@@@Cigarette Smoking \nCigarette smoking is one of the well-known risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Both nicotine and carbon monoxide, which are found in cigarette smoke, can increase the risk of developing this disease. Nicotine, a addictive substance found in cigarettes, is known to increase blood pressure, which can lead to cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, carbon monoxide reduces the amount of oxygen transported in the blood, which can result in a lack of oxygen supply to heart muscle and cause a heart attack. Smoking also decreases the amount of antioxidants in the blood, which help protect cells from damage, leading to increased risk of atheroma formation in the coronary arteries. \n\n@@@High Blood Pressure \nHigh blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is another risk factor for cardiovascular disease. When blood pressure is consistently high, it can cause damage to the artery walls, making them more susceptible to atheroma formation. Atheromas can also result in blood clots, which can block the flow of blood to the heart muscle and lead to a heart attack. Various factors such as being overweight, lack of physical activity, and excessive alcohol consumption can increase blood pressure and therefore, the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. \n\n@@@Uncontrollable Risk Factors \nWhile most risk factors for cardiovascular disease can be controlled, there are some that cannot be changed. These include having a genetic predisposition to coronary heart disease or having high blood pressure due to another medical condition like diabetes. However, by managing and reducing as many of the controllable risk factors as possible, the overall risk of developing cardiovascular disease can be greatly reduced. This includes lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy diet and weight, and managing stress levels.","38":" 78Transport in Plants \u2014 Xylem\n\nTransport in plants isn't really roads and railways, but I guess it's a bit like a flowing river that's carrying stuff around in a network of tubes. When you consider the movement of water, it's all about the xylem. It's pretty exciting stuff...\n\n@@@Introduction to Plant Transport\nPlants have complex systems for transporting water, minerals, and organic substances throughout their tissues. This process plays a crucial role in maintaining the plant's vital functions and survival. One of the key components of plant transport is the xylem.\n\n@@@Two Types of Tissue Involved in Plant Transport\n1) Xylem tissue transports water and mineral ions in solution. These substances move up the plant from the roots to the leaves.\n2) Phloem tissue transports organic substances like sugars (also in solution) both up and down the plant \u2014 there's more about the phloem on pages 80-81. Xylem and phloem work together as mass transport systems, moving substances over large distances throughout the plant.\n\n@@@The Role of Xylem Vessels in Plant Transport\nXylem vessels are responsible for transporting water and mineral ions throughout the plant. They are made up of long, tube-like structures formed from dead cells joined end-to-end. These cells have no end walls, creating an uninterrupted pathway for water to pass through easily. This efficient system allows water to travel from the roots to the leaves against the force of gravity.\n\n@@@The Role of Cohesion and Tension in Water Transportation \nThe movement of water in plants is a result of cohesion and tension. Transpiration, the evaporation of water from the leaves, creates tension (suction) that pulls more water into the leaf. This tension is generated due to the cohesive nature of water molecules, which attract and stick to each other. As water evaporates from the leaves, the remaining water molecules are pulled up through the xylem vessels, creating a continuous column of water moving up the plant.\n\n@@@The Process of Transpiration \nTranspiration is the loss of water from a plant's surface, especially the leaves. This process is a vital side effect of photosynthesis and plays a crucial role in maintaining the plant's water balance.\n\n@@@Factors Affecting Transpiration Rate\nFour main factors affect the rate of transpiration:\n1) Light - More light leads to increased photosynthesis and the opening of stomata, resulting in higher transpiration rates.\n2) Temperature - A warmer temperature increases the movement of water molecules, leading to higher transpiration rates.\n3) Humidity - Low humidity levels create a greater concentration gradient between the leaf and the air, increasing the rate of transpiration.\n4) Wind - Strong winds blow away water molecules from around the stomata, creating a greater concentration gradient and increasing transpiration rate.","39":"\n80Transport in Plants \u2014 Phloem\n\n@@@Introduction\nThe phloem is responsible for the transportation of dissolved organic substances throughout a plant. In contrast to xylem, its counterpart in transport, phloem tissue is adapted for the movement of solutes. This process, known as translocation, is carried out by various cell types within the phloem tissue.\n\n@@@Phloem Tissue and its Functions\n1) Phloem tissue is composed of cells that form tubes for the transport of solutes, such as sugars and amino acids.\n2) Two important cell types in phloem tissue are sieve tube elements and companion cells.\n3) Sieve tube elements act as the main pathway for the flow of solutes.\n4) Unlike other plant cells, they have no nucleus and few organelles, making them more efficient in transporting substances.\n5) Companion cells are responsible for providing the necessary energy for active transport of solutes.\n\n@@@Translocation: Movement of Solutes\n1) Translocation is the process of moving solutes, also known as assimilates, to various parts of the plant where they are needed.\n2) This process requires energy and takes place in the phloem.\n3) Solutes are transported from areas of high concentration, known as the \"source\", to areas of lower concentration, known as the \"sink\".\n4) Leaves are often the source of solutes, while other parts of the plant, such as food storage organs and meristems, are the sinks.\n5) Enzymes play a role in maintaining a concentration gradient from source to sink by modifying solutes at the sink area.\n\n@@@The Mass Flow Hypothesis\n1) The mechanism of translocation is still not fully understood, but the most widely accepted theory is the mass flow hypothesis.\n2) This hypothesis suggests that active transport is used in loading solutes, such as sucrose, into the sieve tubes at the source.\n3) This creates a lower water potential within the sieve tubes, causing water to enter through osmosis from the xylem and companion cells.\n4) This process creates a high pressure within the sieve tubes at the source end.\n5) At the sink end, solutes are removed and used, which increases the water potential and causes water to leave the sieve tubes.\n6) This decreases the pressure within the tubes, creating a pressure gradient that pushes solutes towards the sink.\n7) Experiments have shown that sucrose is transported not only through the sieve tubes, but also through the cell walls of the phloem.\n8) The rate of translocation is directly proportional to the concentration of sucrose at the source.","40":" 82 Topic 4\nThe Structure and Function of DNA\n \nDNA, Genes and Chromosomes \nDNA, the genetic material present in all living organisms, carries the instructions necessary for growth and development. DNA is responsible for many of our inherited traits, both advantageous and disadvantageous. It is the sequence of bases in DNA that determines the functions of living organisms. However, DNA has a complex structure that allows it to store and transmit this information accurately. This section will explore the structure and function of DNA in more detail.\n\n@@@DNA can be cruel - it gave me two feet, but made me bad at football...\n\nMany of our inherited traits are determined by our unique DNA. However, sometimes these traits can be seen in a different light. DNA can be seen as cruel if we inherit traits that are not necessarily advantageous to us. For example, some individuals may have inherited DNA that makes them bad at sports, such as football. While this may seem like DNA's fault, it is important to remember that genes are not solely responsible for our physical or mental abilities. External factors also play a significant role.\n\n@@@DNA is Stored Differently in Different Organisms\n\nWhile the basic structure of DNA is the same in all organisms, the way it is stored and organized can differ. Eukaryotic cells, which make up organisms like plants and animals, store DNA in a more complex manner compared to prokaryotic cells, which are found in bacteria. These differences will be explored in more detail below.\n\nNuclear Eukaryotic DNA is Linear and Associated with Proteins\n\nEukaryotic cells contain linear DNA molecules in the form of thread-like structures called chromosomes. Each chromosome is made up of one long DNA molecule. These chromosomes are found in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. However, due to the extremely long length of the DNA molecule, it must be wound up and packaged in a specific way to fit inside the small nucleus of a cell.\n\nThe DNA molecule is wrapped around proteins called histones, which help support the DNA and keep it organized. The DNA and histone protein complex is then coiled and condensed to make a compact chromosome. This packaging ensures that DNA is able to be stored and transmitted accurately during cell division.\n\n@@@DNA Molecules are Shorter and Circular in Prokaryotes\n\nProkaryotic cells, such as bacteria, also contain DNA in the form of chromosomes. However, the DNA molecules in prokaryotes are shorter and circular in shape. Unlike eukaryotic DNA, prokaryotic DNA is not associated with histone proteins and is instead condensed through supercoiling to fit inside the cell.\n\n@@@DNA Contains Genes\n\nGenes are sequences of DNA bases that code for the production of proteins or functional RNA molecules. The sequence of amino acids in a protein is determined by the order of bases in a gene. Each amino acid is coded for by a sequence of three bases in a gene, known as a triplet. This process is essential for the proper functioning of living organisms and any mistakes can result in genetic disorders.\n\nTo produce a protein, the DNA must first be copied into messenger RNA (mRNA), which is the first step in protein synthesis. However, not all genes code for proteins. Some genes code for functional RNA molecules that have other important roles in protein synthesis.\n\n@@@The Cell's Genome and Proteome\n\nThe complete set of genes present in a cell is known as its genome. The genome contains all the instructions necessary for the cell's growth and development. On the other hand, a cell's proteome is the full range of proteins that the cell is able to produce. This includes the proteins coded for by the genes in its genome as well as other proteins produced through other mechanisms. Together, the genome and proteome make up the unique characteristics and functions of each individual cell.","41":"\n@@@Introduction\nThis section introduces the process of protein synthesis, which involves two stages - transcription and translation. It also mentions the involvement of RNA in both stages.\n\n@@@Types of RNA\nThis subsection explains the different types of RNA, including Messenger RNA (mRNA) and Transfer RNA (tRNA). It also describes the unique characteristics of each type.\n\n@@@Messenger RNA (mRNA)\nThis subsection provides more detail about mRNA, including its involvement in transcription and translation. It also describes its structure and the important role it plays in protein synthesis.\n\n@@@Transfer RNA (tRNA)\nThis subsection delves into the specifics of tRNA, including its function during translation and its distinct shape due to hydrogen bonding. It also describes the two key sites on tRNA - the anticodon and the amino acid binding site.\n\n@@@Transcription\nThis subsection explains the first stage of protein synthesis - transcription. It outlines the steps of transcription and where it takes place in different types of cells.\n\n@@@Initiation of Transcription\nThis subsection explains the first step of transcription, during which an enzyme called RNA polymerase attaches to the DNA and begins the process of mRNA formation.\n\n@@@Elongation of Transcription\nThis subsection describes how the RNA polymerase separates the DNA strands and assembles the mRNA strand, using the template strand as a guide. It also explains how specific base pairing ensures the correct sequence of the mRNA strand.\n\n@@@Termination of Transcription\nThis subsection explains the final step of transcription, during which the RNA polymerase detaches from the DNA once it reaches a specific sequence called a stop signal.\n\n@@@Movement of mRNA to the Cytoplasm\nThis subsection describes how mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the cytoplasm, where it attaches to a ribosome for the next stage of protein synthesis.\n\n@@@Conclusion\nThis section summarizes the process of transcription and how it leads to the formation of mRNA, which is necessary for the next stage of protein synthesis. ","42":" @@@The Genetic Code@@@\nThe genetic code is a fundamental component of genetics, determining the protein that an organism will produce. This code is derived from the sequence of base triplets found in the organism's DNA and is translated by the ribosome to produce a specific amino acid chain. The genetic code is structured to be non-overlapping, degenerate, and universal, allowing for the accurate and consistent production of proteins across all living organisms.\n\n### Non-Overlapping, Degenerate, and Universal Properties of the Genetic Code\n1) The genetic code consists of base triplets, also known as codons, which each code for a specific amino acid.\n2) Each codon is read in sequence, separately from the codons before and after it. This non-overlapping structure ensures the accurate translation of the genetic code.\n3) Additionally, some amino acids are coded for by more than one codon, making the code degenerate.\n4) Start and stop signals, or codons, tell the cell when to begin and end protein production and are found at the beginning and end of the mRNA strand.\n5) The genetic code is also universal, meaning the same codons code for the same amino acids in all living organisms.\n\n### Understanding Nucleic Acids and the Genetic Code \nIn order to fully comprehend the genetic code, one must also have a strong understanding of nucleic acids. These biomolecules, such as DNA and RNA, are responsible for carrying and translating genetic information. This information can be analyzed and interpreted to gain a deeper understanding of an organism's genetic code.\n\n### Interpreting Data About Nucleic Acids\nIn order to fully understand an organism's genetic code, one may need to interpret data related to nucleic acids. This could include using tables or sequences to determine the DNA or RNA sequence for a specific amino acid, or working out the amino acid sequence from a given DNA sequence and a table.\n\n### Giving tRNA Anticodons from mRNA Codons\ntRNA anticodons are complementary copies of mRNA codons and can be determined by using a table, similar to the one shown on the right. These anticodons play a crucial role in protein synthesis as they match up with the mRNA codons to accurately produce the correct amino acid sequence.\n\n### Working Out the Sequence of Amino Acids from mRNA\nIn order to understand the final protein product, it is essential to work out the sequence of amino acids from the mRNA. This can be done by breaking the genetic code into codons and using the information in the table to determine which amino acid each codon codes for. This step is crucial in understanding how the genetic code translates into specific proteins. ","43":" Meiosis and Genetic Variation\n\n@@@Gamete formation \nGametes are necessary for sexual reproduction. They are sperm cells in males and egg cells in females. During fertilisation, these two gametes fuse together to form a zygote, which will grow into a new organism. Gametes have a haploid (n) number of chromosomes, which means there is only one copy of each chromosome. This is different from normal body cells, which have a diploid (2n) number of chromosomes, meaning they contain two copies of each chromosome from both the mother and the father. \n\n@@@Random fertilisation \nDuring sexual reproduction, any sperm can fertilise any egg. This results in zygotes with different combinations of chromosomes from both parents. This random fertilisation process increases genetic diversity within a species. \n\n@@@Meiosis and its importance \nMeiosis is a type of cell division that takes place in the reproductive organs. It is responsible for the formation of gametes with a haploid number of chromosomes. Without meiosis, the number of chromosomes in gametes would double, which is not desirable. Meiosis is an important process in sexual reproduction as it ensures that the offspring has the correct number of chromosomes to grow and develop. \n\n@@@Stages of Meiosis \n1) Before meiosis starts, the DNA replicates to form two copies of each chromosome, known as chromatids. \n2) The DNA condenses to form double-armed chromosomes, with sister chromatids joined in the middle by a centromere. \n3) Meiosis I: Homologous pairs of chromosomes are separated, halving the number of chromosomes. \n4) Meiosis II: Sister chromatids within each chromosome are separated. \n5) Four genetically different haploid cells (gametes) are produced. \n\n@@@Importance of Meiosis in Evolution \nMeiosis and the production of genetically diverse gametes are important for evolution. It leads to offspring with different combinations of genes from both parents, allowing for natural selection to occur. This can lead to adaptations and the survival of certain traits within a species. \n\n@@@Homologous pairs \nHumans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, with one chromosome from each pair coming from the mother and one from the father. These pairs of chromosomes are called homologous pairs, and they are the same size and have the same genes. This means they could have different versions of those genes, called alleles. Meiosis ensures that one chromosome from each homologous pair is passed on to the offspring, resulting in genetic variation. \n\n@@@Identifying Meiosis \nIn exams, it is important to be able to spot when meiosis occurs in different organisms, such as insects or plants. Meiosis is always involved in sexual reproduction, and it is responsible for producing daughter cells (gametes) with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell. It is also important to understand the stages of meiosis and how it reduces the number of chromosomes in gametes. Overall, understanding meiosis is crucial in understanding genetic diversity and evolution.","44":"\n@@@ Protiens\nProteins are essential macromolecules found in all living organisms. These intricate molecules are composed of long chains of amino acids and play crucial roles in various biological processes.\n\n@@@ Variety of Functions \nProteins have diverse structures and shapes, allowing them to perform a wide range of specialized functions. They are involved in metabolic processes, immune response, transportation of molecules, and provide structural support to the body.\n\n@@@ Enzymes\nEnzymes are a type of proteins that have a specific shape due to the tight folding of polypeptide chains. They are soluble in water and facilitate chemical reactions in the body. Digestive enzymes, for example, help in breaking down large molecules in food while others assist in synthesizing new molecules.\n\n@@@ Antibodies\nAntibodies are proteins made up of two light and two heavy polypeptide chains bonded together. They play a significant role in the immune response, protecting the body against foreign invaders. Antibodies have variable regions that allow them to bind to a wide range of antigens.\n\n@@@ Transport Proteins\nChannel proteins, found in cell membranes, are an example of transport proteins. They have hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids that fold up to form channels, allowing the transportation of molecules and ions across the membrane.\n\n@@@ Structural Proteins\nStructural proteins, such as keratin and collagen, have long polypeptide chains lying parallel to each other with cross-links between them. These proteins provide physical strength and support to tissues, such as hair, nails, and connective tissues.\n\n@@@ Biuret Test for Proteins\nThe biuret test is used to determine the presence of proteins in a substance.

This structure is essential for its specific functions.","45":" 89Meiosis and Genetic Variation\n\nMeiosis is a vital process in which different stages and steps contribute to the variation of individuals. The process involves two major events, chromatid crossing over and independent segregation of chromosomes, that work together to produce cells with genetic differences. This not only ensures genetic diversity but also allows for the adaptation of organisms to changing environments. \n\n@@@Chromatid Crossing Over in Meiosis I\n\nMeiosis I starts with homologous pairs of chromosomes coming together to form a synapsis. During this synapsis, the chromatids twist around each other and exchange some of their genetic material. This results in chromatids with a new combination of alleles, even though they still contain the same genes. This process is called crossing over and it occurs between chromatids, rather than between entire chromosomes. Thus, in meiosis I, the chromatids of one chromosome cross over to form a new combination of alleles in the daughter cells. \n\n@@@Meiosis Produces Cells that are Genetically Different\n\nThe main goal of meiosis is to produce genetically different cells. This is achieved through the two major events that occur during the process. First, the crossing over of chromatids in meiosis I leads to the formation of chromatids with different alleles in each of the four daughter cells. Additionally, the independent segregation of chromosomes in meiosis I leads to random sorting of maternal and paternal chromosomes, resulting in different combinations in each of the four daughter cells. This increased genetic variation allows for adaptation and evolution in organisms. \n\n@@@(1) Crossing Over of Chromatids\n\nAs mentioned earlier, crossing over occurs between chromatids in meiosis I. This means that each daughter cell produced from meiosis has different chromatids with a unique combination of alleles. This increases genetic variation among individuals. \n\n@@@(2) Independent Segregation of Chromosomes\n\nThe second event in meiosis I that contributes to genetic variation is the independent segregation of chromosomes. This is known as \"shuffling\" since it involves random sorting of maternal and paternal chromosomes. This leads to different combinations of chromosomes in each of the four daughter cells. Thus, each cell has a different set of alleles, further increasing genetic diversity. \n\n@@@Meiosis Has a Different Outcome to Mitosis\n\nAlthough both meiosis and mitosis are cell division processes, they have different outcomes in terms of genetic variation. Mitosis produces two genetically identical daughter cells, while meiosis produces four genetically different ones. This is because mitosis only involves one division, while meiosis has two divisions that lead to the separation and shuffling of chromosomes. \n\nOutcomes:\n\n- Mitosis produces cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell.\n- Daughter cells are genetically identical to each other and to the parent cell.\n- Produces two daughter cells.\n\n- Meiosis produces cells with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.\n- Daughter cells are genetically different from one another and the parent cell.\n- Produces four daughter cells. \n\n@@@Explanations for the Different Outcomes of Mitosis and Meiosis\n\nThe differences in outcome between mitosis and meiosis can be attributed to the number of divisions involved and the events that occur during each. In mitosis, only one division takes place, separating the sister chromatids and producing two genetically identical daughter cells. However, meiosis involves two divisions, separating both the homologous pairs and the sister chromatids. This results in a shuffling of genetic material, increasing genetic variation and leading to four genetically different daughter cells. Thus, the differences in outcome are due to the varying processes and stages involved in each type of cell division.","46":" @@@Genetic Diversity and Natural Selection \n\nGenetic diversity and natural selection are closely intertwined concepts that play a crucial role in the evolution of species and populations. Genetic diversity refers to the number of different alleles in a species or population, while natural selection is the process by which advantageous alleles are favored and transmitted to subsequent generations. This combination of genetic diversity and natural selection allows for the most well-adapted organisms to reproduce and thrive.\n\n@@@Lots of Different Alleles Means a High Genetic Diversity\n\nAs mentioned, genetic diversity is determined by the number of different alleles present in a species or population. Each gene can have multiple versions, known as alleles, which can result in variations in physical traits or characteristics. This diversity in gene variants is essential for the survival and adaptation of a species in changing environments.\n\nOne way in which genetic diversity is increased is through mutations in the DNA, leading to the formation of new alleles. Additionally, when individuals from one population migrate to another and reproduce, this introduces new alleles into the gene pool of the population. This process, known as gene flow, also contributes to genetic diversity.\n\n@@@Genetic Bottlenecks Reduce Genetic Diversity\n\nA genetic bottleneck occurs when a significant event, such as a disaster or widespread disease, causes a drastic reduction in the population. This sudden decrease in numbers leads to a decrease in the number of different alleles present in the gene pool, resulting in reduced genetic diversity.\n\nFor example, when a large number of organisms within a population die before reproducing, the surviving individuals will pass on their limited set of alleles to the next generation, resulting in reduced genetic diversity. Over time, this can lead to a less adaptable population that is more susceptible to potential environmental changes.\n\n@@@Example \u2014 Northern Elephant Seals\n\nAn example of a genetic bottleneck is seen in the case of northern elephant seals. In the late 1800s, these seals were hunted by humans, leading to a drastic reduction in their population. From an initial size of about 50 individuals, the population has since grown to around 170,000. However, due to the genetic bottleneck, the new population has significantly reduced genetic diversity compared to other related species that did not experience such a bottleneck event.\n\n@@@The Founder Effect is a Type of Genetic Bottleneck\n\nThe founder effect is another form of genetic bottleneck that occurs when a small group of individuals from a population starts a new colony. This new colony is formed with only a small number of different alleles in the initial gene pool, resulting in a shift in the frequency of different alleles compared to the original population.\n\nThis change in allelic frequency can increase the likelihood of certain genetic diseases in the population. The founder effect can occur as a result of geographical separation or isolation from the original population, such as in the case of migration or religious beliefs.\n\n@@@Example \u2014The Amish\n\nAn example of the founder effect can be seen in the Amish population of North America. The Amish are descended from a small group of Swiss immigrants and have remained isolated from the surrounding population due to their strict religious beliefs. As a result, the population has very little genetic diversity and has a higher incidence of certain genetic disorders. The limited gene pool has resulted in an increased frequency of these genetic diseases within the population. ","47":" 94Investigating Selection\n@@@Introduction\nNatural selection is a fundamental concept in biology that explains how different populations evolve over time. In this section, you will learn about natural selection and how it affects different populations. \n\n@@@Different Types of Natural Selection Lead to Different Frequency Patterns\nNatural selection can alter allele frequency in a population. Stabilising selection and directional selection are two types of natural selection that can affect allele frequency in different ways. \n\n@@@Antibiotic Resistance Shows Directional Selection\nDirectional selection occurs when individuals with alleles for extreme characteristics have a higher chance of surviving and reproducing. Bacteria that evolve resistance to antibiotics are an example of directional selection. The process is as follows: \n1) Some individuals in the population have alleles that give them resistance to an antibiotic. \n2) When exposed to the antibiotic, non-resistant bacteria are killed, leaving resistant bacteria to survive and reproduce without competition. \n3) Over time, the resistant allele becomes more common in the population. \n\n@@@Human Birth Weight Shows Stabilising Selection\nStabilising selection occurs when individuals with alleles for characteristics in the middle of the range have a higher chance of surviving and reproducing. One example of stabilising selection is human birth weight. The process is as follows: \n1) Humans have a range of birth weights. \n2) Very small and very large babies are less likely to survive. \n3) Babies with weights closer to the middle of the range are more likely to survive. \n4) Over time, the average weight of human babies tends to shift towards the middle of the range. \n\n@@@Interpreting Data on the Effects of Selection\nTo fully understand natural selection, you must be able to interpret and analyze data on the effects of selection. For example, you might be asked to interpret data about a population of rabbits with varying fur length. \n\n@@@Data on Rabbit Fur Length Changes Over Time\nOne possible scenario is a population of rabbits facing particularly cold winters over a period of six years. The graph may show that the average fur length of the rabbits increased from an initial length of 21 mm to 24 mm after six years. The bars on the graph represent the difference between the shortest and longest fur lengths recorded. \n\n@@@What the Data Indicates\nBased on the data, it can be inferred that directional selection is occurring. Initially, the average fur length was 21 mm, but over time, it gradually increased. \n\n@@@Possible Causes for the Change in Fur Length\nThe increase in fur length can be attributed to the fact that rabbits with longer fur were more likely to survive the harsh winters. This allowed them to pass on their longer fur allele to the next generation, increasing its frequency in the population. ","48":" 96 Classification of Organisms @@@Classification of Organisms\n\nClassification is a fundamental tool for organizing information about the natural world. Scientists have been grouping organisms into categories for hundreds of years in order to more easily recognize and name them. For example, even our own species, Homo sapiens, has been categorized based on our common characteristics.\n\n@@@Phylogeny Tells Us About the Evolutionary History of Organisms\nPhylogeny is the study of the evolutionary relationships between organisms. It helps us understand who is related to whom and how closely related they are. According to phylogeny, all organisms share a common ancestor and have evolved from this ancestor over time. This relationship can be depicted on a phylogenetic tree, which shows the evolutionary connections between organisms.\n\n@@@The Hierarchy of Taxa\nTaxonomy is the branch of biology that focuses on classifying organisms. It involves naming and grouping organisms based on their characteristics. There are eight levels of groups used to classify organisms, called taxa. These groups, from largest to smallest, are: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species.\n\n@@@Domains and Kingdoms\nOrganisms are first sorted into three large groups, or domains: Eukarya, Bacteria, and Archaea. These domains are then further divided into smaller groups called kingdoms. For example, all animals belong to the animal kingdom. Closely related organisms within a kingdom are then grouped into a phylum, and so on down the hierarchy.\n\n@@@Organisms in Each Group Become More Closely Related\nAs you move down the hierarchy of taxa, there are more groups at each level but fewer organisms in each group. This means that the organisms within each group are becoming more and more closely related. The hierarchy ends with the species level, which includes groups that contain only one type of organism.\n\n@@@Importance of Updating Classification Systems\nScientists are constantly updating classification systems as new species are discovered and new evidence about known organisms is uncovered. With advancements in technology, such as DNA sequencing, scientists are able to better understand the evolutionary relationships between organisms and make changes to the classification system accordingly. ","49":" 98DNA Technology, Classification and Diversity\nDNA technology, classification and diversity are three crucial fields in biology that have seen significant advancements in recent years due to advances in DNA and molecular technology.\n \n@@@Advances in Techniques Can Clarify Evolutionary Relationships\nNew or improved technologies have led to the discovery of unknown relationships between organisms and have also provided a clearer understanding of the existing relationships. As a result, these advancements have led to updates in classification systems. Some of the most useful techniques for clarifying evolutionary relationships include genome sequencing, comparing amino acid sequences, and immunological comparisons.\n \n@@@Genome Sequencing\nDNA sequencing is the process of determining the order of the four nitrogenous bases in a DNA molecule (adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine). With the continuous advancements in technology, scientists can now sequence the entire base sequence of an organism's DNA. This sequencing allows for a comparison of DNA base sequences between different organisms, providing insight into the relationships between them. Organisms with a higher percentage of similarity in their DNA base sequences are likely to be more closely related. For example, humans and chimps share about 94% of their DNA base sequence, while humans and mice share about 86%. An interesting example of how this technique has helped clarify evolutionary relationships is the reclassification of skunks into the Mephitidae family from their original classification within the Mustelidae family.\n \n@@@Comparing Amino Acid Sequences\nProteins are made up of amino acids, and the sequence of amino acids in a protein is determined by the order of the DNA bases. The similarities in DNA sequences between related organisms result in similar amino acid sequences in their proteins. A commonly studied protein in this context is cytochrome C, which is found in many different species. The more similar the amino acid sequences between two species, the more closely related they are likely to be. This technique has been useful in identifying evolutionary relationships between species.\n \n@@@Immunological Comparisons\nAnother technique for determining evolutionary relationships is by comparing the proteins of different species using antibodies. When antibodies are added to isolated samples from different species, they will bind to any proteins that are similar to the human version. For example, if antibodies to a human protein are used, the chimp protein will bind to them, indicating a closer relationship to humans than the mouse protein. This method has been particularly useful in studying evolutionary relationships between different species of animals.\n \n@@@Interpreting Data on DNA and Protein Similarities\nIn order to effectively use the aforementioned techniques, it is important to be able to interpret data on DNA and protein similarities. This can be seen in the tables and diagrams that often accompany studies on evolutionary relationships. For example, the table on the left shows the percentage similarity of DNA sequences between several species of bacteria. From this data, it can be concluded that species A and B are more closely related to each other than to either C or D. Similarly, the diagram on the right shows the amino acid sequences of a particular protein from three different species. By comparing these sequences, it is evident that species A and B are more closely related to each other than to C, which suggests a closer evolutionary relationship.","50":" 102Biodiversity\n\n@@@Introduction\n\nBiodiversity refers to the variety of living organisms found in a specific area, from microscopic organisms to plants and animals. It is an essential aspect of our planet's health and plays a crucial role in maintaining ecosystems. Understanding biodiversity is important for conservation efforts and also has implications for human wellbeing.\n\n### The Variety of Organisms\n\nBiodiversity encompasses all living organisms, including those found in the air, on land, and in water. To better understand biodiversity, it is necessary to define key terms.\n\n@@@Biodiversity\n\nBiodiversity is the variety of living organisms found in a specific area. It takes into account the number of species, as well as their genetic, ecological, and evolutionary diversity.\n\n@@@Habitat\n\nHabitat refers to the physical location where an organism lives, such as a forest, desert, or coral reef. Different habitats support different types of organisms.\n\n@@@Species\n\nA species is a group of organisms that share common characteristics and are able to reproduce to give fertile offspring. Organisms can be classified into different species based on their physical similarities and genetic makeup.\n\n@@@Community\n\nA community consists of all the populations of different species living in a particular habitat. It includes both plants and animals, and the interactions between them.\n\n### Biodiversity at Different Levels\n\nBiodiversity can be examined at various scales, from a small local area to the entire planet. Each level provides valuable information about the variety of living organisms present.\n\n@@@Local Biodiversity\n\nLocal biodiversity refers to the variety of different species found in a small habitat, typically in close proximity to each other. These areas can include ponds, meadows, or even backyards. Some habitats are more biodiverse than others, depending on factors such as climate, geography, and human impact.\n\n@@@Global Biodiversity\n\nGlobal biodiversity refers to the variety of species found on Earth. It is estimated that there are approximately 8.7 million species on our planet, with the highest levels of biodiversity found near the equator and decreasing towards the poles.\n\n### Biodiversity Measurement\n\nBiodiversity can be measured in different ways, using various indices and measures.\n\n@@@Species Richness\n\nSpecies richness is a measure of the number of different species in a community. It is calculated by taking random samples of a habitat and counting the number of different species present. This measure provides a simple indication of overall biodiversity.\n\n@@@Species Diversity\n\nSpecies diversity takes into account both the number of species and their relative abundance in a community. It acknowledges that a diverse community is not just made up of a high number of species, but also a balance of populations.\n\n@@@Index of Diversity\n\nThe index of diversity is a more comprehensive measure of biodiversity, as it considers both the number of species and their abundance. It is calculated using a formula that takes into account the total number of organisms of all species and the total number of organisms of a specific species. The higher the index, the more diverse the area is.\n\nIn conclusion, biodiversity is an essential aspect of our planet and is important for the health and balance of ecosystems. Understanding and measuring biodiversity at different levels can help inform conservation efforts and promote the protection of our natural world.","51":" io4 Topic 5 A \u2014 Photosynthesis and Respiration\n\n@@@Introduction\nIn this section, we will explore the concepts of photosynthesis and respiration, two crucial processes necessary for all living organisms to survive. We will also discuss how these processes are interconnected and how they produce the energy needed for life.\n\n@@@Biological Processes Need Energy\nBoth plants and animals require energy for various biological processes to occur. Plants, for example, need energy for photosynthesis, active transport, DNA replication, cell division, and protein synthesis. On the other hand, animals need energy for tasks such as muscle contraction, maintenance of body temperature, active transport, DNA replication, cell division, and protein synthesis. Without energy, these essential processes cannot take place.\n\n@@@Photosynthesis Stores Energy in Glucose\nPhotosynthesis is a complex process that involves converting light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose. This energy is then stored in the glucose until it is needed by the plant. The equation for photosynthesis is 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy -> C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2.\n\n@@@Cells Release Energy from Glucose by Respiration\nCells, both plant and animal, release energy from glucose through a process called respiration. This energy is vital for powering all the biological processes within a cell. There are two types of respiration: aerobic, which requires oxygen, and anaerobic, which does not require oxygen. Both types produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy, but the specific byproducts and energy released differ between aerobic and anaerobic respiration.\n\n@@@ATP is the Immediate Source of Energy in a Cell\nATP, or adenosine triphosphate, is the main source of energy in a cell. Instead of directly using glucose, cells use the energy released from glucose to produce ATP. This molecule acts as an energy carrier, transporting energy to wherever it is needed within the cell. ATP is synthesized through a condensation reaction between ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) using the energy from an energy-releasing reaction, such as the breakdown of glucose in respiration. The enzyme ATP synthase catalyzes this reaction. When ATP diffuses to the part of the cell that requires energy, it is hydrolyzed back into ADP and Pi, releasing the chemical energy stored in the phosphate bond. This process is catalyzed by the enzyme ATP hydrolase. The ADP and Pi can then be recycled to form ATP again, creating a continuous cycle of energy production.","52":" 144 Muscle Contraction\n\nMuscle Contraction: A Physically Demanding Process@@@\nMyofilaments and Filament Binding Sites\nOne of the key components of muscle contraction is the sliding of myofilaments over one another. This process takes a lot of energy, which is why exercise can feel like such a physically demanding activity. Myosin filaments, which are found in muscle cells, have hinged globular heads that are responsible for this movement. These heads have binding sites for both actin and ATP, and actin filaments also have binding sites for myosin heads, known as actin-myosin binding sites. In addition, a protein called tropomyosin is found between actin filaments, which helps facilitate the movement of myofilaments.\n\nTropomyosin: A Key Player in Muscle Contraction@@@\nThe Role of Tropomyosin in Blocking Binding Sites\nIn muscles that are at rest and unstimulated, the actin-myosin binding sites are blocked by the presence of tropomyosin. This prevents myofilaments from sliding past each other because the myosin heads cannot bind to the actin-myosin binding sites on the actin filaments. However, when muscles are stimulated, this process changes.\n\nCalcium Ions: The Trigger for Muscle Contraction@@@\nThe Role of Calcium Ions in Facilitating Contraction\nWhen an action potential from a motor neuron stimulates a muscle cell, it depolarizes the sarcolemma. As a result, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) releases stored calcium ions (Ca2+) into the sarcoplasm. These ions bind to a protein attached to tropomyosin, which then moves the tropomyosin out of the actin-myosin binding site on the actin filament. As a result, myosin heads are able to bind to the exposed site, forming an actin-myosin cross bridge. This process also activates ATP hydrolase, an enzyme that breaks down ATP into ADP and P, providing the energy necessary for muscle contraction. This continuous cycle of attaching, moving, detaching, and reattaching to new binding sites causes the actin filaments to slide along the myosin filaments, resulting in muscle contraction.\n\nThe Role of ATP in Maintaining Muscle Contraction@@@\nThe Importance of ATP in Sustaining Contraction\nIn order for the muscles to continuously contract, ATP is needed to provide the energy for the myosin heads to bend, pulling the actin filament along in a rowing-like movement. Another ATP molecule is necessary to break the actin-myosin cross bridge, allowing for the myosin head to detach from the actin filament and reattach to a new binding site. This cycle repeats rapidly, causing multiple cross bridges to form and break, resulting in the shortening of the sarcomere and the contraction of the muscle. As long as calcium ions are present, this process will continue.\n\nReturning to a Relaxed State@@@\nThe Process of Relaxation in Muscles\nWhen the stimulation of the muscle stops, calcium ions are released from their binding sites and actively transported back into the SR, a process that also requires ATP. As a result, tropomyosin molecules move back to block the actin-myosin binding sites, and no myosin heads are attached to actin filaments. Without actin-myosin cross bridges, the actin filaments are able to slide back to their relaxed position, lengthening the sarcomere. This complete cycle allows for the continual contraction and relaxation of muscles. ","53":" 146\n@@@Topic 6C \u2014 Homeostasis\nHomeostasis Basics\nHomeostasis is the Maintenance of a Stable Internal Environment\n@@@The Importance of Maintaining Internal Environment\n1. Changes in your external environment can affect your internal environment, which is the blood and tissue fluid surrounding your cells.\n2. Homeostasis involves control systems that work to keep your internal environment stable within certain limits.\n3. Maintaining a stable internal environment is essential for cells to function normally and avoid damage.\n4. Some of the key factors in maintaining a stable internal environment include core body temperature and blood pH levels.\n5. Temperature and pH levels can affect enzyme activity, which plays a crucial role in regulating metabolic reactions.\n6. Maintaining the right levels of these key factors is important to ensure efficient metabolic reactions.\n7. Imbalances in temperature and pH levels can lead to denaturation of enzymes.\n8. The optimal temperature for enzyme activity is around 37 \u00b0C, while the optimal pH is typically around 7 (neutral).\n9. However, some enzymes may work best at different pH levels, such as stomach enzymes that function best in a low pH environment.\n10. Blood glucose concentration also plays an important role in maintaining a stable internal environment.\n11. Cells require glucose for energy, and imbalances in blood glucose levels can have damaging effects.\n12. High levels of glucose can disrupt the water potential of blood, causing cells to shrink and potentially die.\n13. Low levels of glucose can result in cells being unable to carry out normal activities due to a lack of energy.\n\n@@@Homeostatic Systems and Negative Feedback\n1. Homeostatic systems involve receptors, a communication system, and effectors (such as the nervous system).\n2. Receptors detect imbalances in levels, whether they are too high or too low.\n3. Once an imbalance is detected, the information is communicated through the nervous or hormonal system.\n4. The effectors then respond by counteracting the change and bringing the level back to normal.\n5. This mechanism of restoring balance is known as negative feedback.\n6. Negative feedback ensures that levels stay around the normal range to maintain a stable internal environment.\n7. However, there are limits to negative feedback and if the change is too large, the effectors may not be able to counteract it.\n8. For example, prolonged exposure to cold weather can lead to a drastic decrease in body temperature, which may be too large for the effectors to correct.\n9. A simple explanation of negative feedback in action for temperature control: \na. If the body detects that the temperature is too hot, it will work to cool down and maintain a normal temperature.\nb. If the body detects that the temperature is too cold, it will work to increase its temperature and bring it back to normal.\nc. This constant balance between cooling and warming mechanisms results in a stable internal body temperature. ","54":"\n@@@Introduction to Controlling Blood Glucose Concentration\n\nControl of Blood Glucose Concentration is a crucial part of homeostatic mechanism that ensures stability in the internal environment of the body. In this section, we will learn about the different factors that impact blood glucose level and how the body responds to maintain a normal concentration. \n\n@@@Eating and Exercise: Changes in Blood Glucose Concentration \n\nOne of the main driving forces for fluctuations in blood glucose concentration is our food intake. After eating a meal that contains carbohydrates, blood glucose level rises. Similarly, during exercise, glucose is used in respiration to provide energy, leading to a decrease in blood glucose concentration. \n\n@@@Hormonal Control: Insulin and Glucagon \n\nThe body employs a specialized hormonal system to regulate blood glucose. Two hormones, insulin and glucagon, play a significant role in this process. These hormones travel in the blood to reach their target cells and regulate blood glucose concentration. \n\n@@@Insulin: Lowering Blood Glucose Concentration \n\nInsulin is secreted by pancreatic cells called beta cells. Its primary function is to lower blood glucose concentration when it is too high. Insulin binds to receptors on liver and muscle cells, increasing their permeability to glucose and stimulating the conversion of glucose into glycogen. It also increases the rate of respiration in cells, mainly muscle cells. \n\n@@@Glucagon: Raising Blood Glucose Concentration\n\nOn the other hand, glucagon, secreted by alpha cells in the pancreas, increases blood glucose concentration when it is too low. It activates enzymes that break down glycogen into glucose, a process known as glycogenolysis. Glucagon also stimulates the formation of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, such as glycerol and amino acids, in a process called gluconeogenesis. \n\n@@@Negative Feedback Mechanisms \n\nTo maintain blood glucose concentration within a normal range, the body uses negative feedback mechanisms. These mechanisms involve the pancreas, which detects blood glucose levels and secretes insulin or glucagon accordingly. When the blood glucose level is too high, insulin is secreted, and when it is too low, glucagon is secreted. This process prevents the glucose levels from becoming too high or too low. \n\n@@@Conclusion \n\nIn conclusion, control of blood glucose concentration is an essential function of the human body. By utilizing hormones and negative feedback mechanisms, the body ensures that the cells receive a constant supply of energy to function correctly.","55":" 10Enzyme Action\nEnzymes crop up loads in biology because they make reactions work quickly. They are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions without being consumed in the process. Enzymes catalyse both intracellular and extracellular metabolic reactions, making them essential for cellular and organismal functions. They are also responsible for the production and maintenance of important structures within organisms. Being proteins themselves, enzymes have a tertiary structure that gives them a highly specific active site. This active site is where the substrate molecules bind to and undergo reactions.\n@@@Enzyme-Catalyzed Reactions\nEnzymes play a critical role in metabolic reactions at both cellular and organismal levels. These reactions are necessary for an organism's survival, such as digestion in mammals or respiration at a cellular level. Enzymes are also involved in the production of structural proteins, like collagen, that are essential for the connective tissues in animals. This emphasizes the importance of enzymes in maintaining proper organismal functions.\n@@@Biological Catalysts\nEnzymes act as biological catalysts by lowering the activation energy of chemical reactions. This means that they reduce the amount of energy needed to initiate a reaction, thus making it happen faster. This property of enzymes is beneficial as it allows reactions to occur at lower temperatures, which is essential for an organism's survival. Without enzymes, the amount of energy needed would be higher and reactions would occur too slowly for an organism to survive.\n@@@Enzyme-Substrate Specificity and Active Site\nEnzymes are highly specific because of their tertiary structure, which results in a specific shape of their active site. This active site is where the substrate molecules bind to the enzyme, forming an enzyme-substrate complex. The specificity of this binding ensures that only the correct substrates can bind, preventing incorrect reactions from occurring.\n@@@Lock and Key vs. Induced Fit Model\nEarly scientists proposed the lock and key model to explain how enzymes interact with their substrates. This model stated that the substrate fits perfectly into the enzyme's active site, just like a key fits into a lock. However, further research revealed that the enzyme-substrate complex undergoes a slight change in shape, called induced fit, in order to fully bind and catalyze the reaction. This modified model better explains the specificity and effectiveness of enzyme-substrate interactions. ","56":" Homeostasis is the process by which the body maintains a stable internal environment, despite changes in the external environment. This is important for the proper functioning of the body's cells, tissues, and organs.\n@@@Introduction\nHomeostasis is essential for the survival of all living organisms. While it is a highly efficient process, it is not always able to maintain a stable internal environment. One example of this is diabetes.\n@@@Diabetes: Occurs when Blood Glucose Concentration is Not Controlled\nDiabetes mellitus is a condition where blood glucose concentration cannot be controlled properly. There are two types of diabetes: Type I and Type II.\n@@@Type I Diabetes\nType I diabetes is an autoimmune disease, in which the immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. This means that the body is unable to produce insulin, a hormone that regulates blood glucose levels. The exact cause of this immune response is still unknown, but it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Type I diabetes is usually diagnosed in childhood or adolescence.\n@@@Effects of Untreated Type I Diabetes\nWithout insulin, blood glucose levels remain high after a meal, a condition known as hyperglycemia. This can lead to serious health complications and even death if left untreated. The excess glucose is also excreted in the urine, leading to frequent urination and thirst.\n@@@Treatment for Type I Diabetes\nType I diabetes is treated with insulin therapy. This involves regular insulin injections throughout the day, or the use of an insulin pump to deliver insulin continuously. Careful monitoring and dosage adjustments are necessary to avoid hypoglycemia, a dangerous drop in blood glucose levels. Additionally, managing carbohydrate intake can help regulate blood glucose levels.\n@@@Type II Diabetes\nType II diabetes is the more common form of diabetes, typically developed in adulthood. It is often associated with obesity and a sedentary lifestyle, but it can also have genetic factors. In Type II diabetes, the body either does not produce enough insulin or the cells are resistant to its effects.\n@@@Risk Factors and Treatment for Type II Diabetes\nRisk factors for developing Type II diabetes include obesity, lack of physical activity, age, and poor diet. Treatment involves lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight loss if necessary. In some cases, medication may be necessary. Insulin injections may also be needed in advanced cases.\n@@@Type II Diabetes as a Growing Health Problem\nType II diabetes is becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly in Western countries. This is due to factors such as a rise in obesity rates, unhealthy diets, and low levels of physical activity. This has led to additional health problems, including visual impairment and kidney failure. As a result, efforts are being made to educate the public and reduce the incidence of Type II diabetes.\n@@@Efforts to Address the Problem of Type II Diabetes\nPublic health campaigns, such as the NHS's 'Change4Life', aim to promote healthier diets and lifestyles to reduce the risk of developing Type II diabetes. Health advisors have also challenged the food industry to make their products more nutritious and to provide clearer labeling for consumers. However, there is still pressure on companies to prioritize profits over public health concerns.","57":" @@@The Kidneys\n The kidneys play a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis in the body through their various functions and processes. The kidneys regulate blood water potential and excrete waste products through the processes of ultrafiltration, selective reabsorption, and urine production. \n \n@@@The Excretory Function of the Kidneys\nOne of the main functions of the kidneys is to excrete waste products from the body, such as urea. Urea is a toxic byproduct of protein metabolism and must be excreted to maintain healthy levels in the body. The process of excretion helps to keep the blood clean and free of harmful substances. \n\n@@@Regulation of Blood Water Potential\nThe kidneys also play a crucial role in regulating the water potential of the blood. This is important because it helps to maintain the proper balance of fluids in the body. The regulation of water potential is necessary to prevent dehydration or overhydration. \n\n@@@Ultrafiltration: The Start of Nephrons\nThe filtering of blood in the kidneys begins at the nephrons, which are long tubules that surround bundles of capillaries. These capillaries, called glomeruli, are responsible for the process of ultrafiltration. \n\n@@@The Process of Ultrafiltration\nDuring ultrafiltration, blood from the renal artery enters smaller arterioles in the cortex of the kidney. These arterioles then split into glomeruli, which are bundles of capillaries enclosed in a hollow ball called the Bowman's capsule. The afferent arteriole brings blood into the glomerulus, while the efferent arteriole carries it away. The high pressure inside the glomerulus forces liquid and small molecules out of the capillary and into the Bowman's capsule. \n\n@@@The Structure of a Nephron\nThe nephron is made up of several structures, including the Bowman's capsule, the proximal convoluted tubule, the loop of Henle, and the distal convoluted tubule. Each of these structures plays a crucial role in the process of filtration and reabsorption. \n\n@@@Selective Reabsorption\nAfter the initial ultrafiltration process, the remaining glomerular filtrate moves through the rest of the nephron. Along the way, useful substances such as glucose and water are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream through the process of selective reabsorption. This helps to maintain the right balance of fluids and nutrients in the body. \n\n@@@Urine Production\nThe remaining unwanted substances from the glomerular filtrate are passed through the nephron and into the collecting duct. From there, they are transported to the bladder for storage and eventual excretion as urine. This process helps to remove waste products and maintain the body's homeostasis.","58":" 7 @@@Investigating Populations\n\nPopulations are dynamic and ever-changing, making it necessary to keep track of population size and distribution. There are various methods available to investigate populations, each with its own unique approach and purpose.\n\n@@@Taking a Random Sample from the Area You're Investigating\n\nIn order to gather information about a population, taking a random sample from the area being investigated is essential. This makes the process more manageable and reduces the likelihood of biased results. There are a few steps involved in taking a random sample: choosing the area to sample, selecting random sites within that area, using appropriate techniques to take a sample, and repeating the process multiple times. The mean of the data collected from each sample can then be used to estimate the population of the entire area.\n\n@@@Using Quadrats and Transects to Investigate Non-Motile Organisms\n\nQuadrats and transects are commonly used to investigate non-motile organisms such as plants and slow-moving organisms like limpets. A quadrat is a square frame divided into smaller squares, and it is placed at different points within the area being investigated. The frequency and number of individuals of each species can be recorded in each quadrat. Percentage cover is also measured by counting the number of squares covered by a species. Transects, which are lines placed across an area, can help determine how plants are distributed. Belt transects, where quadrats are placed next to each other along the transect, and interrupted belt transects, where quadrats are placed at intervals along the line, are used to cover a larger distance and gather more information.\n\n@@@Mark-Release-Recapture: A Method for Investigating More Motile Species\n\nWhen investigating populations of more motile species, a different method is needed. The mark-release-recapture method is a commonly used technique to measure the abundance of these species. The process involves capturing a sample of the species, marking them in a harmless way, releasing them back into their habitat, and then taking a second sample a week later. The number of marked individuals in the second sample is used to estimate the total population size. However, this method does require a few assumptions to be considered, such as the marking having no impact on the individuals' chances of survival and the population being stable during the study period.","59":" 776Succession\n@@@Succession\n\n\nSuccession is a natural process that takes place in ecosystems over time. It involves a series of stages where the biotic and abiotic conditions of an ecosystem change and new species move in to replace the previous ones. There are two types of succession: primary and secondary, each with its own process and characteristics.\n \nPrimary Succession\n\n@@@Primary Succession\n\nPrimary succession occurs in areas where there is no existing soil or organic material present, such as newly formed or exposed land. This can happen due to natural events, such as volcanic eruptions or changes in sea level. The process starts with the colonization of pioneer species, which are specially adapted to survive in harsh conditions. These species, like marram grass, gradually change the abiotic conditions of their surroundings, making it more suitable for other species to move in.\n \nThe Stages of Primary Succession\n\n@@@The Stages of Primary Succession\n\n1) Pioneer species begin to grow and colonize the area.\n\n2) The abiotic conditions start to change due to the growth and death of pioneer species. This creates a basic soil that can retain water.\n\n3) As the soil deepens and becomes richer in nutrients, new species with different adaptations can move in and thrive.\n\n4) This process continues as the diversity of species increases, leading to more complex and stable ecosystems.\n\n5) New species may change the environment in a way that makes it less suitable for the previous species, leading to a replacement of dominant species.\n \nSecondary Succession\n\n@@@Secondary Succession\n\nSecondary succession occurs in areas where there is already a layer of soil, but the vegetation has been cleared, for example, due to a forest fire or human activity. This process follows a similar pattern to primary succession, but starts at a later stage, with larger plants as the pioneer species.\n \nThe Main Stages of Succession\n\n@@@The Main Stages of Succession\n\nAt each stage of succession, different plants and animals take over as the dominant species, leading to an increase in biodiversity. This process continues until a climax community is reached, where the ecosystem reaches a steady state and supports the most complex community of plants and animals it can.\n \nExample of Primary Succession\n\n@@@Example of Primary Succession\n \nAn example of primary succession can be seen in the transformation of bare rock into a woodland ecosystem.\n\n1) Pioneer species, such as lichens, colonize the rocks and start to break them down, releasing minerals.\n\n2) As the lichens die and decompose, they contribute to the formation of a thin layer of soil.\n\n3) With the addition of more organic material, the soil thickens, allowing for the growth of other species, like mosses.\n\n4) As the soil deepens, larger plants, such as grasses and flowering plants, can take root.\n\n5) Eventually, shrubs, ferns, and small trees will out-compete the smaller plants and become the dominant species.\n\n6) The soil continues to deepen as the larger plants die and are decomposed, setting the stage for the growth of large trees, which will form the climax community.","60":" 178 Conservation\n@@@Conservation\nConservation is the practice of protecting and managing species and their habitats in a sustainable way. This means ensuring that resources are used in a way that meets the needs of both current and future generations. However, there can often be conflicts between human needs and conservation efforts.\n\n@@@Conflict between Human Needs and Conservation\nNot everyone agrees with conservation measures, which can lead to conflicts. Balancing the needs of both humans and conservation is crucial in maintaining the sustainability of natural resources. For example, in the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya, the traditional livelihood of the Maasai people, livestock farming, can come into conflict with conservation efforts. Overgrazing by livestock can destroy the grassland necessary for wildlife. To address this conflict, conservation trusts work with the Maasai people to implement sustainable farming practices and encourage ecotourism as an alternative source of income.\n\n@@@Methods of Conservation\nThere are various methods of conservation, including species-specific conservation and habitat protection. Some examples of conservation techniques include maintaining seed banks for plants, implementing fishing quotas to protect fish species, and establishing protected areas such as national parks and nature reserves. Additionally, endangered species can also be bred in captivity and reintroduced into the wild to increase their numbers.\n\n@@@Evaluating Evidence and Data about Conservation Issues\nTo properly understand conservation issues, it is necessary to evaluate evidence and data. As seen in the example of conserving British bluebells, reliable data is crucial in drawing accurate conclusions. It is important to consider the experimental methods used, such as controlling for other variables and using appropriate sample sizes. Evaluating data and evidence allows us to understand the effectiveness of conservation efforts and make informed decisions for future conservation projects.","61":" 180 Topic 8A \u2014 Mutations and Gene ExpressionMutations\nMutations are Changes to the Base Sequence of DNA\n@@@Introduction\nMutations have been long recognized as fundamental to evolution and also as cause of diseases. Although you've already studied about mutations in Topic 4, this time you will get to know about them in detail.\n\n@@@Definition of Mutations\nAny modifications in the base (nucleotide) sequence of DNA are called mutations. Their rate of occurrence can increase due to mutagenic agents like those found in the environment or as a result of errors during DNA replication.\n\n@@@Types of Mutations\nMutations occur in different forms which include substitution, deletion, addition, duplication, inversion, and translocation. Substitution is when a certain number of bases are replaced by other bases. In deletion, one or more bases are removed. Addition, as the term suggests, is the insertion of one or more bases in the DNA sequence. Duplication is the replication of one or more bases in the sequence. In inversion, a section of bases is reversed in order. Lastly, translocation is when a sequence of bases is transferred to a different location in the genome.\n\n@@@Mutations and Amino Acid Sequence\nThe order of DNA bases in a gene and their subsequent translation into RNA determines the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide. Mutations in these genes can lead to changes in the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide, affecting the structure and function of the protein.\n\n@@@Effects of Mutations on Proteins\nProteins, which are made up of polypeptides, carry out various functions in the body. A change in the amino acid sequence can alter the protein\u2019s three-dimensional shape, rendering it incapable of performing its intended tasks. This can happen to enzymes, which are proteins that facilitate chemical reactions in the body. A mutation in the polypeptide that makes up an enzyme can change the shape of the enzyme's active site, preventing substrates from binding and leading to an inability to catalyze reactions.\n\n@@@Impact of Mutations on Health\nSome mutations in genes can cause genetic disorders, which are inherited disorders that result from abnormal genes or chromosomes. For example, the mutation responsible for cystic fibrosis causes the body to produce thick, sticky mucus in the lungs and digestive system. Additionally, some mutations can increase the risk of developing certain types of cancer, such as mutations in the BRCA1 gene that increase the likelihood of breast cancer.\n\n@@@Hereditary Mutations\nIf a gamete (sex cell) carrying a mutation for a genetic disorder or a certain type of cancer is fertilized, the resulting offspring will also have the mutation. These mutations are called hereditary mutations and are passed on from one generation to the next, potentially contributing to evolution.\n\n@@@Not All Mutations Affect Amino Acid Sequence\nDue to the degenerate nature of the genetic code, some mutations may not result in a change in the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide. This is because certain amino acids can be coded for by more than one DNA triplet. In such cases, the mutation is called a \"silent mutation\" as it does not affect the amino acid sequence.\n\n@@@Examples of Silent Mutations\nSubstitutions that code for the same amino acid, such as a change from TAT to TAC, still result in the same polypeptide being produced. Similarly, an inversion of a section of the DNA may not alter the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide. These mutations may not have any noticeable effect on the protein\u2019s function. ","62":"\n@@@Introduction\nCancer is a disease that can affect anyone, both human and animal, of any age. It is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and can have devastating consequences for those who are diagnosed with it. Here, we will discuss how cancer can occur and the various subtypes of this disease.\n\n@@@Mutations in Genes Can Cause Uncontrolled Cell Growth\nOne of the main causes of cancer is mutations that occur in genes. These mutations, also known as DNA changes, can happen at any point in an individual's life. Mutations that occur after fertilization are called acquired mutations and can lead to uncontrolled cell division. This process is known as mitosis.\n\n@@@Tumours and Their Types\nThe result of uncontrolled cell division is a mass of abnormal cells called a tumour. Tumours can invade and destroy surrounding tissue, leading to more significant health issues. There are two types of tumours based on their characteristics - benign and malignant.\n\n@@@Tumour suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes\nTumour suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes are two types of genes that control cell division. A mutation in these genes can lead to developing cancer. Tumour suppressor genes, when working correctly, slow down cell division and produce proteins that cause cells to self-destruct. However, if a mutation occurs, the proteins are not produced, leading to uncontrolled cell division and tumour formation. On the other hand, proto-oncogenes stimulate cell division, and mutations in these genes can cause them to become overactive, resulting in uncontrolled cell growth.\n\n@@@Tumours can be Benign or Malignant (Cancerous)\nAs mentioned earlier, there are two types of tumours - benign and malignant. Benign tumours are not cancerous and grow at a slower pace than malignant tumours. They are often surrounded by fibrous tissue that prevents the cells from invading surrounding tissues. On the other hand, malignant tumours are cancerous and grow rapidly, destroying nearby tissues. These tumours can also spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system, making them more dangerous.\n\n@@@Tumour Cells Look and Function Differently to Normal Cells\nTumour cells not only look different from normal cells but also function differently. These cells have an irregular shape, and their nucleus is typically larger and darker. They also do not produce all the necessary proteins to function correctly and may have multiple nuclei. Moreover, tumour cells have different antigens on their surface and do not respond to normal growth processes. They also divide more frequently by mitosis, leading to rapid tumour growth.\n\n@@@Topic 8A \u2014 Mutations and Gene Expression\nIn this section, we have discussed how mutations in genes can play a significant role in the development of cancer. Tumour suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes, when functioning correctly, control cell division. However, mutations in these genes can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and tumour formation. These mutations can occur at any point in an individual's life and can have severe consequences. By understanding the role of mutations in gene expression, we can better understand and potentially prevent the development of cancer.","63":" 196 Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n \n@@@Whole Genome Sequencing\nWhole genome sequencing is the process of deciphering the complete DNA sequence of an organism. This process involves breaking down an organism's DNA into smaller fragments and then analyzing and piecing them back together to determine the entire genome's sequence. Technological advancements have enabled scientists to successfully sequence the entire genomes of various organisms, ranging from bacteria to complex organisms like humans. For instance, the Human Genome Project, which took over a decade to complete, was a major breakthrough in understanding the sequence of the human genome.\n\n@@@Decoding the Proteome of Simple Organisms\nThe proteome, which is the complete set of proteins produced by an organism, can be identified from the genome sequence. Simple organisms, such as bacteria, have a small amount of non-coding DNA, making it relatively easier to determine their proteome. This information can be valuable in medical research and development, such as in the identification of protein antigens on the surface of disease-causing bacteria or viruses. For example, sequencing the genome of N. meningitidis group B bacteria helped identify antigens for the development of a vaccine against meningitis B.\n\n@@@Challenges in Deciphering Complex Organism Genomes\nIn contrast to simple organisms, complex organisms have large sections of non-coding DNA and complex regulatory genes. These regulatory genes determine when certain genes should be turned on or off, making it more challenging to translate a complex organism's genome into its proteome. However, work is being done to identify the proteome of humans, with over 30,000 human proteins identified so far.\n\n@@@Continuous Advancements in Sequencing Methods\nSequencing methods have continuously evolved, becoming more efficient, cost-effective, and high-throughput. In the past, sequencing methods required significant manual labor and could only be done on a small scale. However, newer techniques, such as pyrosequencing, can now sequence up to 400 million bases in just ten hours, a significant improvement compared to older techniques. With these advancements, scientists can now sequence whole genomes at a much faster rate, facilitating further research and discovery in the field of genomics.","64":" 797Genome Projects and Making DNA Fragments\nRecombinant DNA Technology and Its Applications\n- Recombinant DNA technology allows for the transfer of specific DNA fragments from one organism to another, resulting in the production of desired proteins in the recipient organism. This process is universal and can occur between different species, leading to the creation of transgenic organisms.\n\n@@@DNA Fragments and Their Production\n- In order to transfer the target gene from one organism to another, a DNA fragment containing the gene must first be obtained. There are three methods by which DNA fragments can be produced.\n\nUsing Reverse Transcriptase\n- Obtaining a DNA fragment with the target gene can be difficult as cells typically only contain two copies of each gene. However, they contain many mRNA molecules that are complementary to the gene of interest, making it easier to isolate. These mRNA molecules can then be used as templates for the synthesis of DNA, with the enzyme reverse transcriptase converting them into complementary DNA (cDNA).\n\nUsing Restriction Endonuclease Enzymes\n- Some sections of DNA have palindromic sequences, where the base pairs read the same in opposite directions. This allows for the use of restriction endonucleases, enzymes that recognize specific palindromic sequences and cut the DNA at those points. Different endonucleases have different recognition sequences, allowing for targeted cutting of specific DNA fragments.\n\n@@@Restriction Endonucleases in Detail\n- Restriction endonucleases cut at specific recognition sequences, as the shape of these sequences complement the active site of the enzyme. For example, the restriction endonuclease EcoR\\ recognizes and cuts at the sequence GAATTC, while Hind\\cuts at AAGCTT. By targeting the recognition sequence, specific DNA fragments can be separated from the rest of the DNA.\n\nSticky Ends and Their Role in DNA Fragment Binding\n- Sometimes, the cut made by a restriction endonuclease leaves behind sticky ends, small tails of unpaired bases on each end of the fragment. These sticky ends can be used to bind the DNA fragment to another piece of DNA that has complementary sticky ends. This allows for the creation of recombinant DNA molecules, which can then be inserted into the cells of the recipient organism for protein production.\n\n@@@Applications of Recombinant DNA Technology\n- Recombinant DNA technology has many applications in research, medicine, and industry. Some examples include the production of insulin for diabetes treatment, the development of genetically modified crops, and the creation of transgenic animals for medical research. Additionally, DNA fragments produced by this technology are used in DNA sequencing projects, allowing for a better understanding of the genetic makeup of various organisms. ","65":" 199Amplifying DNA Fragments\nOne of the first steps in genetic manipulation of DNA is to amplify the desired DNA fragment. This is essential to ensure that there is a sufficient quantity of the DNA fragment for further experimentation. There are several techniques that can be used to amplify DNA fragments, including in vivo amplification.\n@@@In Vivo Amplification\nIn vivo cloning is a method used to amplify DNA fragments inside a living organism. This involves transforming host cells with the DNA fragment, allowing the cells to replicate and produce multiple copies of the DNA fragment.\n@@@Step 1 - Vector Insertion\nFirst, the DNA fragment is inserted into a vector, which is a molecule used to transfer DNA into a cell. Vectors can be plasmids or bacteriophages, and they are cut open using the same restriction endonuclease enzyme that was used to isolate the DNA fragment. The vector's sticky ends are complementary to the sticky ends of the DNA fragment, allowing for the two to be joined together using DNA ligase.\nThe resulting combination of vector DNA and DNA fragment is known as recombinant DNA.\n@@@Step 2 - Vector Transfers DNA Fragment into Host Cells\nThe next step involves using the vector to transfer the DNA fragment into host cells. For plasmid vectors, the host cells must be treated to make their cell walls more permeable, allowing them to take in the plasmids. This can be achieved through methods such as heat-shocking the cells.\nBacteriophage vectors work by infecting the host cells and injecting their DNA into them. The DNA containing the gene of interest then becomes integrated into the bacterial DNA.\nOnce the host cells have taken up the vector and its DNA, they are said to be transformed.\n@@@Step 3 - Identifying Transformed Host Cells\nOnly a small percentage of host cells will successfully take up the vector and the desired DNA fragment. To identify which cells have been transformed, marker genes can be used. These genes are inserted into the vectors along with the desired DNA fragment, allowing for easy identification of transformed cells.\nTransformed cells can be identified through methods such as growing them on agar plates containing specific antibiotics or under UV light, depending on the type of marker gene used. The identified transformed cells are then allowed to grow and replicate, producing multiple copies of the cloned gene.\n@@@Promoter and Terminator Regions\nTo produce proteins from the cloned DNA fragment, it is important to ensure that the vector contains specific promoter and terminator regions. These regions are responsible for initiating and stopping the production of mRNA by the enzyme RNA polymerase. Without the proper promoter region, the desired protein cannot be produced.\nIn some cases, the vector may already contain the necessary promoter and terminator regions. However, they may also need to be added in along with the DNA fragment. ","66":" 77Enzyme Action...but the Induced Fit\u2019 Model is a Better Theory\n\n@@@Enzyme Specificity and the Induced Fit Model  \nEnzymes are highly specific catalysts that only bind to and catalyze one particular reaction each. This specificity is due to the fact that enzymes require a complementary substrate to fit into its active site. However, the substrate not only has to fit the shape of the active site, but it also has to cause it to change shape in a specific way. This is known as the induced fit model and it helps to explain the high degree of specificity exhibited by enzymes.\n\n@@@The 'Lock and Key' Model Vs. the 'Induced Fit' Model  \nThe original model proposed for enzyme action was the 'lock and key' model, where the substrate is seen as a key that fits perfectly into the enzyme's active site, which is the lock. This model only explained the specificity of enzymes based on shape, but the induced fit model takes into account the change in shape of the active site upon binding of the substrate. This new model has been widely accepted, but may change in the future as new evidence emerges.\n\n@@@Enzyme Properties and Tertiary Structure  \nThe tertiary structure of an enzyme, which is determined by its primary structure, plays a crucial role in enzyme specificity. Each different enzyme has a unique tertiary structure, resulting in a specific shape for its active site. This means that only one complementary substrate can fit into the active site, leading to enzyme specificity. \n\n@@@Factors Affecting the Tertiary Structure of Enzymes  \nThe shape of the active site is not constant and can be altered by changes in pH or temperature. Small fluctuations in these factors can cause the tertiary structure of an enzyme to change, making the active site no longer complementary to the substrate. As a result, the enzyme will no longer be able to carry out its function.\n\n@@@Impact of Gene Mutations on Enzyme Structure  \nThe primary structure of a protein, including enzymes, is determined by the sequence of amino acids in its gene. If there is a mutation in this gene, it could have a significant impact on the structure of the enzyme produced. This alteration in the tertiary structure can affect the shape of the active site, rendering the enzyme inactive.\n\n@@@Practice Questions and Exam Questions  \nQuestions related to enzyme action and specificity are commonly tested in exams. Understanding the 'induced fit' model and how factors like pH and temperature can affect enzyme activity is crucial for success. The topic also covers the impact of gene mutations on enzyme structure and function, which is another important concept to understand.","67":" @@@Applications of Recombinant DNA Technology \n\nRecombinant DNA technology has many practical applications in various fields including agriculture, industry, and medicine. In this section, we will discuss some of the ways in which transformed organisms can benefit humans and improve our society.\n\n@@@ Transforming Microorganisms for Protein Production\nMicroorganisms such as bacteria and yeasts can be transformed using the same technology as in vivo cloning to produce large quantities of useful proteins. This is known as genetic engineering. One example is inserting a foreign gene into a bacteria to produce human insulin. This method allows for the production of important proteins in a cost effective and efficient manner.\n\n@@@ Producing Transformed Plants\nPlants can also be transformed using recombinant DNA technology. A desirable gene can be inserted into a plasmid and then transferred into a bacterium. The bacterium, acting as a vector, can then transfer the gene into plant cells. This process can be used to create plants with improved traits, such as higher yields, nutrient content, and pest resistance.\n\n@@@ Transforming Animals for Protein Production\nIn addition to microorganisms and plants, animals can also be transformed using recombinant DNA technology. A gene for a desired protein can be inserted into an early embryo or into the egg cells of a female. As a result, the transformed animal's body cells will contain the gene, or if inserted into the egg cells, all of her offspring will contain the gene. This method has potential benefits for medicine and agriculture.\n\n@@@ Controlling Protein Production in Animals \nBy using specific promoter regions, the production of proteins in transformed animals can be controlled and limited to certain cell types. This allows for easier harvesting of the protein and also prevents any potential harm to the organism.\n\n@@@ Agricultural Applications\nTransformed organisms have many applications in agriculture. Crops can be genetically modified to have higher yields, improved nutrition, and resistance to pests. This can help reduce the risk of famine and malnutrition in areas where there is a shortage of dietary nutrients. Additionally, the use of transformed crops reduces the need for pesticides, reducing associated costs and environmental problems.\n\n@@@Industrial Applications \nRecombinant DNA technology is also used in industrial processes. Many enzymes used in these processes can be produced from transformed organisms, allowing for large-scale production at a lower cost.\n\n@@@Medical Applications \nTransformed organisms have revolutionized the production of drugs and vaccines. By producing these substances in large quantities and at a lower cost, many important medications are now more accessible and affordable. For example, human insulin, used to treat diabetes, is now produced by transformed microorganisms rather than animal sources.\n\n@@@Conclusion\nAs demonstrated, recombinant DNA technology has a wide range of practical applications. Through its use, we can improve food production, create more efficient industrial processes, and create important medical advancements. These benefits have greatly improved our society and will continue to do so in the future.","68":" 202Using Recombinant DNA Technology\n@@@Concerns About the Use of Recombinant DNA Technology\nEthical, financial, and social concerns have been raised regarding the use of recombinant DNA technology.\n\n@@@Concerns in Agriculture\nOne concern is the potential monoculture of crops, in which farmers plant only one type of genetically transformed crop. This could make the entire crop vulnerable to the same disease due to all plants being genetically identical. Environmentalists are also worried about the loss of biodiversity as monocultures can damage the environment. There is also the possibility of \"superweeds,\" which are weeds that have become resistant to herbicides due to interbreeding with genetically transformed crops.\n\nAnother concern is the contamination of organic crops by genetically modified crops, which can result in the loss of organic certification and income for organic farmers.\n\n@@@Concerns in Industry\nThe growth of large multinational biotechnology companies at the expense of smaller companies has raised concerns among anti-globalisation activists. As these companies continue to expand, they become more powerful, potentially causing smaller companies to go out of business. Without proper labelling, consumers may not have a choice in consuming genetically modified foods and products.\n\nSome markets, such as the EU, do not import genetically modified products, causing economic loss for producers who traditionally sell to these markets.\n\nAnother concern is the limitation of potentially life-saving technologies by companies that own genetic engineering technologies. There are also fears of unethical use of the technology, such as creating \"designer babies.\"\n\n@@@Ownership Issues\nRecombinant DNA technology also raises ownership issues. There is debate over who owns genetic material once it has been removed from the body, the donor or the researcher. Some argue that individuals hold the right to their genetic information, while others argue that value is created by the researcher who uses it to develop medicines or in diagnosis.\n\nThere is also an issue with a small number of corporations owning patents to certain seeds and charging high prices, including \"technology fees.\" Farmers can also be sued for breaching patent laws if their non-GM crops are contaminated by GM crops.\n\nBut, many believe that the benefits of recombinant DNA technology will outweigh these concerns.\n\n###Humanitarian Benefits\nRecombinant DNA technology has the potential to greatly benefit humanity.\n\n@@@Famine and Malnutrition\nOne potential benefit is the production of agricultural crops that could help reduce the risk of famine and malnutrition. For example, drought-resistant crops could be developed for areas prone to drought, providing a more stable food source.\n\n@@@Pharmaceutical Products\nTransformed crops could also be used to produce pharmaceutical products, such as vaccines, which could benefit areas where refrigeration is not readily available. This could make drugs more accessible to those who need them.\n\n@@@Affordability of Medicines\nRecombinant DNA technology also has the potential to lower the cost of medicines, making them more affordable for a larger population.\n\n@@@Gene Therapy\nAnother potential use of recombinant DNA technology is in gene therapy to treat human diseases. This has the potential to greatly improve the lives of those suffering from genetic disorders.","69":" 204Gene Probes and Medical Diagnosis\n Gene probes and DNA hybridization are crucial in medical diagnosis and genetic screening for various purposes. Some common uses of gene probes, such as locating specific alleles in a person's DNA or detecting mutated alleles that cause genetic disorders, will be discussed in this section.\n\n@@@Locating Specific Alleles Using DNA Probes\nDNA probes are short strands of DNA with a specific base sequence that is complementary to the sequence of a target allele. These probes can be used to locate specific alleles on chromosomes or to identify mutated alleles that cause genetic disorders. The process involves the use of a labeled DNA probe that specifically binds to the target allele, allowing for its detection.\n\n@@@Different Types of Labels for DNA Probes\nThere are two common types of labels attached to DNA probes: radioactive labels and fluorescent labels. Radioactive labels are detected using X-ray film, while fluorescent labels are detected using UV light. This labeling allows for the visualization of the bound DNA probe, indicating the presence of the targeted allele.\n\n@@@Using DNA Probes in Medical Diagnosis\nIn medical diagnosis, DNA probes are utilized to identify specific alleles of a gene or to detect mutated alleles that cause genetic disorders. The process involves digesting a DNA sample into fragments using restriction enzymes, separating the fragments using electrophoresis, and then transferring them to a nylon membrane. The membrane is incubated with a fluorescently labeled DNA probe, which will hybridize to the targeted allele if it is present in the sample. Exposure to UV light will reveal the presence of a fluorescent band, indicating the presence of the gene in question.\n\n@@@DNA Probes in DNA Microarrays\nAlternatively, DNA probes can be used in DNA microarrays, which allows for the screening of multiple genes at once. This process involves a glass slide with microscopic spots of different DNA probes attached to it. A sample of fluorescently labeled human DNA is then washed over the array, and if the labeled DNA contains sequences that match any of the probes, they will stick to the array. Visualization under UV light will indicate the presence of specific alleles in the person's DNA.\n\n@@@The Process of Producing a DNA Probe\nTo produce a DNA probe, the allele that needs to be screened is first sequenced. Then, PCR is used to produce multiple copies of the complementary sequence, which will serve as the probe for the screening process.\n\n@@@Screening Using DNA Probes Has Numerous Applications\nUsing DNA probes for screening has a wide range of applications in medical diagnosis and genetic testing. Some examples include identifying inherited conditions, determining a patient's response to specific drugs, and identifying health risks.\n\n@@@Identifying Inherited Conditions\nScreening using DNA probes can help identify inherited conditions, such as Huntington's disease, a genetic disorder that affects the nervous system. By screening for the mutated allele, individuals can find out if they have inherited the disease, allowing for early treatment. The NHS also offers screening for newborn babies for inherited disorders like cystic fibrosis, which can aid in early treatment and management of the condition.\n\n@@@Determining Drug Response and Health Risks\nDNA probes can also be used to determine how a patient may respond to a specific drug, such as the use of Herceptin\u00ae for a particular type of breast cancer. Screening for specific mutations in the HER2 proto-oncogene can help determine if Herceptin\u00ae will be an effective treatment for the patient.\n\nAdditionally, genetic screening can also help identify health risks. Certain inherited mutations can increase a person's chances of developing certain cancers, and knowing about these alleles can help individuals make lifestyle choices to reduce their risk. However, there are concerns about potential discrimination by insurance companies and employers based on genetic screening results. ","70":"\n\n@@@ The concept of opportunity cost  \nOpportunity cost refers to the value of the next best alternative that is given up when a decision to purchase a product is made. This concept applies to all economic decision-makers, including consumers, businesses, and governments.\n\n@@@ The role of the entrepreneur  \nEntrepreneurs play a crucial role in the economy by starting new business ventures. They can introduce innovative ideas, new ways of offering products or services, or enter new markets. They are responsible for managing the business and are willing to take on the risks of failure.\n\n@@@ Characteristics of successful entrepreneurs  \nSuccessful entrepreneurs possess certain personal qualities and skills that contribute to their success. These include innovation, commitment and self-motivation, multi-skilling, leadership skills, self-confidence, and a risk-taking mindset.\n\n@@@ Innovation  \nInnovation is the ability to introduce new ideas, carve a new niche in the market, and attract customers in innovative ways. This requires originality and creativity to distinguish the business from others in the same market.\n\n@@@ Commitment and self-motivation  \nEntrepreneurship is not an easy path, and it requires hard work, dedication, and long hours. Successful entrepreneurs are committed to their goals, self-motivated, ambitious, and have a strong focus on their business.\n\n@@@ Multiskilling  \nEntrepreneurs must wear many hats in their business, such as product developer, marketer, salesperson, and accountant. Therefore, they need to have a diverse skill set, be eager to learn new skills, and have good interpersonal and financial management abilities.\n\n@@@ Leadership skills  \nEntrepreneurs must lead by example and have a personality that motivates and inspires their employees. They must be able to make decisions, problem-solve, and create a positive work environment.\n\n@@@ Self-confidence and resilience  \nFailure is a common occurrence in entrepreneurship, but successful entrepreneurs have strong self-belief and the ability to bounce back from setbacks. They have a positive attitude towards challenges and view them as opportunities for growth.\n\n@@@ Risk-taking  \nEntrepreneurs must be willing to take risks to achieve success. This can involve investing their own resources into the business or taking chances on new ideas.\n\n@@@ Major challenges faced by entrepreneurs  \nEntrepreneurship is a challenging path that involves various difficulties and hurdles. Some of the major challenges faced by entrepreneurs include identifying successful business opportunities, accessing finances, managing cash flow, competition, and balancing work and personal life.\n\n@@@ Identifying successful business opportunities  \nIdentifying a market need and developing a product or service that meets the demand is crucial for the success of a business. This requires market research, innovation, and understanding customer needs and preferences.\n\n@@@ Accessing finances  \nEntrepreneurs often face challenges in securing funding for their business ventures, especially in the early stages. They may need to rely on personal savings, loans, or investors to finance their business.\n\n@@@ Managing cash flow  \nCash flow management is essential for the survival and growth of a business. Entrepreneurs must balance the inflow and outflow of cash to ensure that there is enough liquidity to cover expenses and invest in the business.\n\n@@@ Competition  \nIn today's competitive business world, entrepreneurs must face tough competition from existing businesses and new entrants. They must continuously innovate and differentiate their products or services to stay ahead.\n\n@@@ Balancing work and personal life  \nEntrepreneurs often work long and irregular hours, which can take a toll on their personal life. They must strike a balance between work and personal life to avoid burnout and maintain a healthy lifestyle. \n\n@@@ Example of successful entrepreneurship: Rama Karaturi  \nRama Karaturi, a successful entrepreneur, started his rose-growing business in Bangalore after identifying a market need for flowers. He invested his own savings, took risks, and worked hard to make his business a success. He possesses qualities like self-motivation, multi-skilling, and risk-taking, which contributed to the growth of his business. ","71":"\n\nWhat is the breakup of a new business?\n\n@@@\nThe Advantages and Drawbacks of Keeping Business Costs Low\n\nOne of the first considerations for any new business is finding ways to keep costs low. This allows for higher profits and increases the chances of survival. However, there are also potential drawbacks to this approach.\n\nLocation and its Impact on Business Success\n\nOne of the potential drawbacks of keeping costs low is that a business may not be located in the area with the most potential customers. The location of a business can greatly impact its success. Additionally, a business with its own prestigious premises may instill more confidence in potential customers, whereas operating from a less impressive location may have the opposite effect.\n\nBalancing Private and Working Life in a Low-Cost Business\n\nAnother potential drawback of keeping costs low is that it may cause family tensions and difficulty separating one's private and working life. This can be especially challenging for those who choose to operate their business from home.\n\nThe Importance of Location for Businesses Offering Consumer Services\n\nWhen considering location, businesses offering consumer services must be especially careful. For example, a website designer can effectively operate from home, while a hairdresser may need to be located in an area with a high potential customer base. Another option is to visit customers in their own homes, thereby avoiding the costs of buying or renting premises.\n\nThe Reality of Competition for New Businesses\n\nCompetition is nearly always a challenge for new businesses, especially if the business idea is not unique. Established businesses often have more resources and market knowledge, giving them an advantage over new businesses. To overcome this, new businesses must offer better customer service.\n\nThe Importance of Building a Customer Base for New Businesses\n\nTo survive and succeed, a new business needs to quickly establish itself in the market and build up its customer base. This requires not only attracting new customers, but also encouraging them to become repeat customers. Small businesses often do this by offering personalized and knowledgeable customer service, as well as fulfilling unique customer requests.\n\nUnderstanding the Potential for Failure in New Businesses\n\nDespite having all the necessary qualities, success for a new business is never guaranteed. In fact, many new businesses fail within their first year of operation. There are various reasons why this may happen, including the need for a strong customer demand and competition from similar businesses.\n\nSources of Business Ideas and Opportunities for New Enterprises\n\nEntrepreneurs often get their business ideas from their own skills and hobbies or previous employment experiences. Franchising conferences and exhibitions also offer a range of business start-up ideas with the added benefits of support from a larger franchiser. Small-scale market research can also reveal potential gaps in the market.\n\nUnderstanding the Challenges of Sourcing Capital for a New Business\n\nSourcing capital, or finance, is a common challenge for new businesses. Limited personal savings, lack of awareness about available financial support, a lack of past business success, and a poorly produced business plan can all make it difficult to obtain necessary funding for a new venture.\n\nThe Importance of Location and Minimizing Fixed Costs for New Businesses\n\nOne of the most important considerations when choosing a location for a new business is keeping fixed costs low. This involves minimizing the break-even level of output, which is the minimum amount of revenue needed to cover all costs. Operating from home is often the most practical option for new and low-cost businesses.","72":" Lack of record keeping \nWhen running a business, it is imperative to keep accurate records, failure to do so often being a key factor in business failure. Entrepreneurs tend to discount its importance due to the belief that it is less important than meeting the needs of their customers, putting themselves at a disadvantage. The concept of remembering, whilst tempting, is ultimately flawed, and may lead to total inability to retain up-to-date records on important business transactions; a busy florist, for example, may do poor business without accurate records. \n@@@Closing Accounts\nOne important aspect of record keeping is the ability to take into account all expenses, such as delivery costs, bills, wages paid to employees etc. This practise often becomes more challenging when the business progresses to involving larger investments.\n@@@The Importance of Accurate Records\nLack of cash and working capital\nAnother primary reason for the failure of new businesses relate to the insufficient operational funds to keep the business running. Money is required to manage daily operations, hold enough inventory for business obligations and to provide customers with services. If enough capital is not available, the business may not be able to replenish its stored supplies or keep up with financial commitments, leading to closure. \n@@@Surviving the Early Days\nBusiness start-ups could possibly be avoided, to some extent, if certain measures were taken before or during start-up.\nOne of the best ways to manage liquidity risks is by creating monthly reviews about the cash flow, in order to anticipate the financial requirements for the coming months. Be sure to have your bank manager go through your records and keep the cash flow updated.\n@@@Effective Planning\nOn the whole, it is of utmost importance to plan the initial capital investments wellbefore the start of operations, taking into account the probability of minor issues in customer payments. Effective management of accounts may also ensure that payments are obtained within an appropriate time frame.  \n@@@Asset Covering\nPlans should be made to enlist total asset cover (TAC) as a security measure much before the business becomes operational.\nPoor management skills\nStarting a business is a task that needs complex managerial skills, likely to have been acquired only through work experience. Entrepreneurs entering leadership roles may not have experience such as:\n\u25a0 Cash handling and management abilities.\n\u25a0 Competent leadership skills.\n\u25a0 Business planning and coordination abilities.\n\u25a0 Good decision-making skills.\n\u25a0 Efficient communication skills.\n\u25a0 Strong marketing and sales skills.\nOftentimes, entrepreneurs are either hard-working or might possess certain talents in specialised professions, but their shortcomings in administration can jeopardise the future of their business. \n@@@Boosting Management Abilities\nIn order to avoid a shortfall in management expertise, many training programs are easily reachable and are run by organizations willing to offer their advice and assistance to new entrepreneurs. Hiring skilled and experienced staff might also be a way out of this predicament. However, a question arises; Can the business that has been freshly established, afford such expensive options? Experts also suggest that every entrepreneur must undergo compulsory training to ensure that their business capital is not in vain or until their professional skills are fully honed, for a safe start-up.\n@@@Personal Aspirations\nNewly established businesses are not simply doomed but there are other various formattive voids that are usually overlooked. Businessmen believe sheer enthusiasm, strength of character and hard-work is enough. Whilst this might be true, many face failure, falling short of success. Hence, it is advised for potential entrepreneurs to first acquire some management skills, through employment or training, before investing their money in risk. \nChanges in the business environment\nThe business environment, constantly changing, imposes different risks for businesses entering its arena. \nIf these changes were to be neglected, it could deal significant damage to businesses, resulting in loss of capital.\n@@@Risks Associated with Change\nBusiness set-ups have an inherent risk factor associated with changes that occur in the economy. This is a key subject around which the Business syllabus is structured and discussed in great detail. In addition to the challenges discussed above, changes can drastically impact the initial business plan resulting in failure. \n@@@Risk Management\nChange is a dynamic concept and effective management of risks associated with change could lead to successful businesses. Entrepreneurs should be prepared for possible fluctuations in the environment, such as changes in consumer preferences, market trends and others. Business strategies should have a scope for contingency plans, to counter sudden changes and ensure smooth functioning. \n@@@Importance of Adapting to Changes\nA realistic aspect of business is that changes are inevitable. It is crucial for entrepreneurs to be adaptive to these changes in order to be successful in the long run. Business strategies need constant revisions and modifications in order to remain relevant to the current market scenario. ","73":"@@@title: Rising Incomes and Changing Consumption Patterns \nAs incomes rise, people tend to spend more on services and less on goods. This trend is seen in the growth of sectors such as tourism, financial services, and restaurants, while spending on goods has been increasing at a slower pace. This change in consumption patterns has important implications for businesses and economies. \n\n@@@title: International Competition and the Secondary Sector\nAs manufacturing businesses in developed countries face increasing competition from more efficient and cheaper rivals in other countries, the domestic secondary-sector firms are losing market share. This has led to a rise in imports of goods and a declining share of total employment in the secondary sector. \n\n@@@title: Sector Variations in Employment \nThe relative importance of each sector varies between different economies. For example, Table 2.1 highlights the differences in sectoral employment shares for three different countries. \n\n@@@title: Public and Private Sector Classifications \nAside from industry sectors, businesses can also be classified by public or private sector and type of legal organization. These classifications are interconnected, as certain legal structures are only found in the private sector. The main difference between the two sectors lies in their ownership and control, with the public sector being accountable to and controlled by the government, while the private sector is owned and controlled by individuals or groups. \n\n@@@title: Importance of Private Sector in Mixed Economies \nIn most mixed economies, the majority of business activity takes place in the private sector. However, the relative size of the private sector compared to the public sector can vary greatly among countries. Economies with a more free-market system tend to have smaller public sectors, while those with central planning and command economies have a greater presence of state-controlled businesses. \n\n@@@title: Types of Legal Organization in the Private Sector \nThe private sector comprises a variety of different businesses, both in terms of size and legal structure. The most common type of business organization is the sole trader, where a single owner has full control and responsibility for the business. Other legal structures include partnerships, private limited companies, and public limited companies, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. \n\n@@@title: Role of the Public Sector \nIn mixed economies, the state may provide important goods and services such as health care, education, and defense, which are deemed too significant to be left solely in the hands of private businesses. In some cases, strategic industries, such as energy and telecommunications, may also be owned and controlled by the government. However, there has been a trend towards privatization, where these state-owned industries are sold off to the private sector. \n\n@@@title: Public Goods and the Role of Taxes \nAnother reason for the state to provide certain goods and services is the existence of public goods, which cannot be charged for and therefore cannot be provided efficiently by the private sector. Examples of public goods include street lighting and public transportation. In these cases, taxes are used to fund and provide these services. \n\n@@@title: Legal Structure of Private Sector Businesses \nFigure 2.1 shows the main types of private sector businesses, including sole traders, partnerships, private limited companies, and public limited companies. While sole traders are the most common form of business, their turnover is often smaller compared to other legal structures. Each type of organization has its advantages and disadvantages, and choosing the most suitable structure depends on the specific needs and goals of the business owner.","74":"\n\n@@@Partnership\n\nPartnerships are a business form created by two or more individuals who share a capital investment and responsibilities. While it offers certain advantages, there are also disadvantages to consider.\n\n@@@Advantages of Partnerships\n\nPartnerships are considered easy to set up, with no legal formalities required. This allows for a quick start to the business venture. Additionally, the owner has complete control of the business and is not answerable to anyone else. This level of control can be appealing to some entrepreneurs. The owner is also able to keep all profits and has the flexibility to choose working times and patterns. This type of business also allows for establishing personal relationships with employees and customers, which can be beneficial for small businesses. The business can also be based on the interests or skills of the owner, rather than working as an employee for a larger firm.\n\n@@@Disadvantages of Partnerships\n\nOne of the biggest disadvantages of partnerships is unlimited liability. This means that all partners are personally responsible for the business's debts and their personal assets can be used to pay off business debts. This type of liability can discourage potential entrepreneurs from starting a business. Partnerships also often face intense competition from larger firms, making it difficult to thrive. Owners may also struggle to specialize in areas of the business that they find most interesting as they are responsible for all aspects of management. Partnerships are also limited in their ability to raise additional capital, as they rely on the partners' savings, profits, and loans. Long working hours are also often necessary for the business to be successful. Additionally, there is a lack of continuity as the business does not have a separate legal status and will end when the owner dies.\n\n@@@Differences from Sole Traders\n\nSole traders are similar to partnerships as they are both types of businesses owned by one person or a group of individuals. However, partnerships have the added advantage of shared responsibilities and capital investment. While sole traders have complete control over their business, they also face unlimited liability and limitations in raising capital.\n\n@@@Potential Challenges for Partnerships\n\nPartnerships also face potential challenges, such as poor decision making and errors made by any one partner being the responsibility of all partners. Additionally, any business debts incurred by one partner are also the responsibility of all partners. This can be a significant risk for individuals who go into business partnerships.\n\n@@@Formal Deed of Partnership\n\nAlthough not a legal requirement, it is usual for partnerships to have a formal Deed of Partnership between all partners. This document outlines key details such as voting rights, profit distribution, management roles of each partner, and who has the authority to sign contracts. This helps to prevent conflicts and disagreements between partners in the future.\n\n@@@Is Partnership the Right Choice?\n\nWhen considering converting a sole trader business into a partnership, it is important to carefully weigh the potential advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, partnerships offer shared responsibilities and capital investment, but they also come with the potential challenges and risks mentioned above. It is crucial to consider all factors before making a decision.","75":"Companies\n\n@@@Advantages and Disadvantages of Partnerships  \nPartnerships can be a popular form of business organisation due to the ability to specialize in different areas of management, shared decision-making, and the shared burden of losses. However, unlimited liability for all partners, lack of continuity in the event of a partner's death, and the binding decisions of all partners can be disadvantages to this type of business structure. \n\n@@@Limited Liability  \nThe division of ownership into shares allows for the advantage of limited liability for shareholders. This means that their potential loss is limited to the amount they have invested in the company, rather than their total personal wealth. This encourages investors to provide finance for company expansion, as their risk is reduced. Creditors also benefit from limited liability, as their risk of the company failing to pay its debts is now transferred from them to investors. This is why creditors are interested in whether a business is a limited company and will closely examine its accounts. \n\n@@@Legal Personality  \nA company is recognized as having its own legal identity separate from its owners, which means that it can be sued and sue others in court. This protects the owners from personal liability for the company's actions, unlike sole traders or partnerships. However, directors are still responsible for their actions and can be held accountable if they knowingly continue trading when the company is unable to pay its debts. \n\n@@@Continuity  \nOne of the biggest advantages of a company is continuity. The death of an owner or director does not result in the company breaking up or dissolving. Ownership simply continues through inheritance of shares and there is no disruption in operations. This offers stability and security for the company and its stakeholders. \n\n@@@Private Limited Companies  \nPrivate limited companies are small to medium-sized businesses that are owned by shareholders who are often family members. They cannot sell shares to the general public but still offer the protection of limited liability. ","76":" @@@Th e word \u2018Limited\u2019 or \u2018Ltd\u2019 (\u2018Pte\u2019 in \n\nsome countries) tells us that the business \nhas this legal form. Usually the shares will \nbe owned by the original sole trader, relatives, \nfriends and employees. Th e former sole trader \no ft en still has a controlling interest. \n@@@Private Limited Companies and their Shareholders\nPrivate limited companies, often abbreviated as \"Ltd\" or \"Pte\" in some countries, are a legal form of business ownership where the shares are typically owned by the original sole trader, relatives, friends, and employees. This means that the former sole trader often still holds a majority of shares and can maintain control over the company's management and decision-making processes. However, certain legal formalities are required to establish a private limited company, which will be explained in more detail in the section on public limited companies. Private limited companies have both advantages and disadvantages, which are summarized in Table 2.4.\n\n@@@Private Limited Companies: Advantages and Disadvantages\nPrivate limited companies offer several advantages, such as limited liability for shareholders, a separate legal entity, continuity in the event of a shareholder's death, and the ability to raise capital through the sale of shares to family, friends, and employees. However, there are also disadvantages, including the difficulty of selling shares, legal formalities involved in establishing the business, and the fact that end-of-year accounts must be made publically available. These factors may limit the opportunities for investment and potential growth compared to other legal forms of business ownership.\n\n@@@Terms to Know: Share, Shareholder\nIn addition to understanding the advantages and disadvantages of private limited companies, it is important to know key terms associated with this legal form of business. A share is a certificate that represents part ownership in a company and entitles the shareholder to dividends and certain rights. Shareholders are individuals or institutions that own shares in a limited company.\n\n@@@Public Limited Companies\nPublic limited companies, or \"plc,\" can be recognized by the use of \"plc\" or \"inc.\" after the company name. This type of business organization is typically used for large companies looking to expand and raise substantial funds. One of the main advantages of being a plc is the ability to advertise and sell shares on the stock market. This allows for potential large sums of money to be raised from the sale of shares to the public, and provides the opportunity for existing shareholders to quickly sell their shares if needed.\n\n@@@Distinction between Ownership and Control\nOne major difference between private and public limited companies is the \"divorce between ownership and control.\" While the original owners of a private limited company can still retain a majority of shares and control over management, this is typically not the case for public limited companies due to the large number of shareholders. Instead, a board of directors is appointed by the shareholders to make management and decision-making decisions.\n\n@@@Potential Conflicts and Reasons for Conversion\nThe distinction between ownership and control in public limited companies can sometimes lead to conflicts within the company. Shareholders may have different objectives and preferences for the business compared to the directors, who are responsible for managing the company. This is referred to as \"divorce between ownership and control,\" and can potentially damage the long-term investment plans of the business. Private limited companies may convert to public limited companies for reasons listed in Table 2.5, but some companies, such as Richard Branson's Virgin Group, have also converted back to private limited companies to overcome this issue and maintain long-term planning and control.\n\n@@@Reversibility of Conversion\nIt is possible for a public limited company to revert back to private limited company status, allowing for senior executives to have a majority of shares and maintain control over management. One reason for this reversal may be to overcome the \"short-termism\" commonly associated with plc's, where major investors are thought to prioritize short-term profits over long-term growth. However, this conversion also means that the company's end-of-year accounts are no longer available for public inspection and there is less transparency regarding financial affairs.","77":" 72 Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity\n\nEnzymes are essential proteins that catalyze metabolic reactions for living organisms. They are able to speed up reactions by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to occur. Enzymes are highly specific and have distinct requirements for their activity, with multiple factors affecting their function.\n\n@@@Temperature: A Big Influence on Enzyme Activity\n\nTemperature plays a crucial role in enzyme activity. As the temperature increases, so does the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction due to an increase in kinetic energy. This causes enzyme and substrate molecules to move faster and collide more frequently, increasing the potential for successful reactions. However, if the temperature exceeds the optimal range, the reaction can come to a halt. This is because as temperature increases, the enzyme molecules vibrate more, potentially breaking the bonds that hold the enzyme in shape. This results in a change in the shape of the active site, making it unable to bind to the substrate molecules. When an enzyme becomes denatured, it is no longer functional as a catalyst.\n\n@@@pH: Another Factor Affecting Enzyme Activity\n\npH is another crucial factor that affects enzyme activity. Each enzyme has an optimal pH range in which it functions most efficiently. For most human enzymes, this is at a neutral pH of 7. However, there are exceptions such as pepsin, which has an optimal pH of 2 and is found in the stomach. A change in pH can disrupt the ionic and hydrogen bonds that hold the enzyme's tertiary structure, causing the active site to change shape and the enzyme to become denatured.\n\n@@@Enzyme Concentration: Affecting the Rate of Reaction\n\nThe concentration of enzymes in a solution also affects the rate of reaction. The more enzyme molecules present, the more likely collisions with substrate molecules will occur, resulting in enzyme-substrate complex formation. As a result, the rate of reaction increases with an increase in enzyme concentration. However, there comes a point where adding more enzymes has no effect, as there are already enough enzymes to handle all the available substrate.\n\n@@@Substrate Concentration: Affecting the Rate of Reaction Up to a Point\n\nSimilarly, substrate concentration also affects the rate of reaction. At low concentrations, the rate of reaction increases with an increase in substrate concentration, as there are more substrate molecules available for successful collisions with enzymes. However, there comes a point where all the active sites of the enzymes become occupied, and adding more substrate has no further effect on the reaction rate. \n\n@@@Topic 1A - Biological Molecules\n","78":" this chapter covers syllabus.section AS Level 1.3.@@@This chapter covers syllabus section AS Level 1.3 - TALE OF TWO INDUSTRIES\nThe Indian steel industry\nThe Indian steel industry is made up of large steel plants that employ thousands of workers and have millions of dollars invested in advanced equipment. Companies like Tata, one of the largest steel makers in the world, have grown by taking over other companies, such as European steel giant Corus. The industry produces annual output valued in the millions, making it a major contributor to the Indian economy. \n@@@The Indian retail industry\nIn contrast, the Indian retail industry is predominantly made up of small retail outlets and street hawkers, accounting for more than 95% of retail sales in the country. These businesses employ only a few workers and do not have much investment in modern technology. However, there is a growing trend of large retail groups, such as Reliance and Walmart, becoming established in the retail sector. It is predicted that the market share of these organized retail groups will reach 28% by 2017. This trend has sparked controversy and has resulted in pressure groups, like the National Movement for Retail Democracy, organizing demonstrations to demand that big corporations leave the retail industry.\n@@@Comparing the sizes of businesses\nThe significant difference in the size of the average steel plant and the average retail shop can be attributed to various factors such as the level of investment, technology, and number of employees. Steel production requires large capital investment and advanced equipment, while retail shops often have smaller investment and do not require advanced technology. Additionally, the demand for steel, especially in industries like car manufacturing, is much higher compared to the demand for retail products, which leads to larger scale production and employment in the steel industry.\n@@@Impact of mergers and takeovers\nThe recent takeover of Corus by Tata has raised questions about the impact it will have on the steel industry and its consumers. It is believed that the takeover will benefit consumers, especially car manufacturers, with an increase in production and competitive prices. However, the growing number of large retail shops owned by a few corporations has sparked concerns about the impact on consumers and small retailers. \n@@@Measuring the size of businesses\nMeasuring the size of businesses is an important aspect when it comes to comparing and assessing their performance. It can be measured through various factors such as the number of employees, revenue, assets, and market share. Each method has its limitations, but combined, they provide a comprehensive understanding of a business's size and growth.\n@@@Advantages of small and large businesses\nSmall businesses can have a positive impact on the economy by creating jobs, stimulating competition, and encouraging innovation. They also receive special assistance from governments, as they are considered the backbone of a country's economy. On the other hand, large businesses have economies of scale, which allow them to produce goods at a lower cost and offer competitive prices. They also have a greater reach and influence in the market.\n@@@Internal and external growth\nInternal growth refers to the expansion of a business through increasing its capacity, production, and sales. This can be achieved through initiatives such as increasing marketing efforts, introducing new products or services, or investing in research and development. External growth, on the other hand, involves merging with or acquiring other companies. This allows businesses to expand their operations and market share. Both forms of growth have their advantages and disadvantages, and it is essential for businesses to carefully consider the impact on stakeholders and the sustainability of their growth strategies.","79":"\n\n\n@@@Measuring Business Size\n\n@@@Importance of Measuring Business Size\n\nBusiness size is a crucial factor in comparing and analyzing businesses. Government agencies, investors, and customers all have a vested interest in understanding the size of a business and how it compares to others in the industry.\n\n@@@Problems with Measuring Business Size\n\nHowever, there are challenges in accurately measuring and comparing business size, which can lead to conflicting results. Additionally, there is no internationally agreed definition of a small, medium, or large business, making it difficult to determine a uniform measure of size.\n\n@@@Different Measures of Business Size\n\nThere are several different ways of measuring business size, each with its own limitations and benefits. These include the number of employees, revenue, capital employed, market capitalization, and market share.\n\n@@@Number of Employees\n\nThe number of employees is a simple and easily understandable measure of a business's size. However, it may not accurately reflect the scope and complexity of a business, as some companies may have higher productivity with fewer employees, such as highly automated industries.\n\n@@@Revenue\n\nRevenue is often used as a measure of size, especially when comparing businesses in the same industry. However, it can be misleading when comparing businesses in different industries with varying product values.\n\n@@@Capital Employed\n\nCapital employed refers to the total value of long-term investments in a business. Larger businesses generally have a higher capital investment, but cross-industry comparisons can be misleading due to differing capital equipment needs.\n\n@@@Market Capitalization\n\nMarket capitalization is only applicable to publicly traded companies and is calculated by multiplying the current share price by the total number of shares issued. However, this measure can be unstable as share prices tend to fluctuate daily.\n\n@@@Market Share\n\nMarket share is a relative measure, indicating a business's sales as a proportion of total market sales. While a high market share suggests a significant market presence, it may not accurately represent the actual size of the business in a small market.","80":" Other measures that can be used\nTh ese will depend very much on the industry. Th e  n u m b e r\nof guest beds or guest rooms could be used to compare \nhotel businesses. Th e number of shops could be used \nfor retailers. Total fl oor sales space could also be used to \ncompare retail businesses.\n\n@@@ Industry-Relevant Measures\nDifferent industries may use different forms of measurement to compare businesses. In the hotel industry, the number of guest beds or guest rooms is a useful comparison, while in retail, the number of shops or total floor sales space can be used.\n\n@@@ Using Profit to Assess Performance\nWhile profit is not a good measure of business size, it can be used to assess business performance.\n\n### Which form of measurement is best?\nThere is no one \"best\" measure of business size. The most appropriate measurement will depend on the specific information needed about the businesses being compared. This could vary based on whether the goal is to assess absolute size or relative size within a specific industry. In cases where an absolute measure of size is needed, it is often best to use multiple criteria for comparison in order to get a more comprehensive understanding.\n\n@@@ Keeping in Mind Potential Differences\nWhen analyzing data on the sizes of different businesses, it is important to remember that using different measurements could yield entirely different conclusions about relative size.\n\n### The Significance of Small and Micro-businesses\nWhile there is no universally agreed upon definition of small businesses, they are easily identifiable by their low number of employees and turnover compared to larger organizations. Each country may have its own official definition which can be obtained from the trade and industry department. Additionally, there is a distinction made for \"micro-enterprises\" which are very small businesses. The European Union provides definitions for small, medium, and micro-enterprises.\n\n### Importance of Small Businesses\nSmall businesses play a crucial role in economies and industries. They create jobs and employ a significant portion of the working population. They also bring new ideas and products to the market, creating diversity and choice for consumers. Furthermore, they provide competition for larger businesses, potentially preventing them from taking advantage of consumers. Small businesses can also supply specialized goods and services to larger companies, increasing their competitiveness. In addition, many successful large businesses started out as small businesses, highlighting the potential for growth and success. Finally, small businesses may have lower costs than larger organizations, which can result in cost savings for consumers. ","81":"\n\n@@@ Common Corporate Objectives\n\nCorporate objectives are the overarching goals that guide a business's actions and strategies. They are typically based upon the central aim or mission of the business but are expressed in specific terms to provide a clearer guide for management. Here are some of the most common corporate objectives found in businesses today.\n\n###Profit Maximisation\n\nOne of the most widely known corporate objectives is profit maximisation. This objective involves producing at a level of output that generates the greatest positive difference between total revenue and total costs. It is based on the belief that seeking the maximum profit available from a given venture is the most rational course of action. However, this objective also has its limitations, some of which include:\n\n- Focusing on short-term profits may invite competition and jeopardise long-term survival.\n- Many businesses prioritise maximising sales for market share rather than profits.\n- Smaller businesses may be more concerned with safeguarding leisure time and retaining control.\n- Business analysts often gauge performance through return on capital rather than total profit.\n- Other stakeholders may have different priorities, such as job security or environmental concerns, which can pressure businesses to make less profitable decisions.\n\n###Profit Satisficing\n\nOn the other hand, profit satisficing is an objective that involves aiming to earn enough profit to keep owners satisfied, but not striving to maximise profits at all costs. This objective is often found in small businesses, where owners prefer to lead comfortable lives and have a healthy work-life balance. Once a satisfactory level of profit is achieved, other objectives, such as more leisure time, take priority.\n\n###Growth\n\nThe growth of a business, typically measured in terms of sales or the value of output, is a common objective that offers several benefits to managers and owners. Some of these benefits include:\n\n- Larger firms are less vulnerable to takeovers and can benefit from economies of scale.\n- Managers may be motivated by the desire to see the business reach its full potential, which can result in higher salaries and fringe benefits.\n- Businesses that fail to grow may lose their appeal to investors and become less competitive.\n\nHowever, growth also has its limitations, such as:\n\n- Rapid expansion can lead to cash flow problems.\n- Sales growth may come at the expense of lower profit margins.\n- Certain businesses may experience diseconomies of scale.\n- Using profits to finance growth may lead to lower returns for shareholders.\n- Expanding into new business areas and activities may result in a loss of focus and direction for the whole organisation.\n\n###Increasing Market Share\n\nIncreasing market share is closely linked to the overall growth of a business. It indicates that the business's marketing mix is more successful than its competitors'. Some of the benefits of having the highest market share, also known as being the brand leader, include:\n\n- Retailers are more likely to stock and promote the best-selling brand.\n- Profit margins offered to retailers may be lower, leaving more profit for the producer.\n- Effective promotional campaigns can be based on the brand's reputation as the market leader.\n\n###Survival\n\nFor new business start-ups, the main objective is to survive the first two years of trading. With the high failure rate of new businesses, making it past this critical stage is a significant accomplishment. Once the business is well-established, other longer-term objectives can be established.","82":" \n\n@@@Introduction  \nReuters is one of the world's leading news agencies and in recent years, the company has seen a return to profitability after a period of losses. The company's primary aim is to increase value for its shareholders and evidence suggests that it is achieving this goal as its shares have been performing above average in the market. This can be attributed to various factors, including cost-cutting measures and successful expansion strategies.\n\n@@@Evidence of meeting objectives  \nOne of the main indicators that Reuters is meeting its objectives is the significant increase in its share prices. This indicates that the company is becoming increasingly successful and attracting more investors. Additionally, the company's profits have also seen a significant rise, which can be linked to its successful cost-cutting measures and ambitious growth objectives.\n\n@@@Benefits to managers and other employees  \nHaving clearly stated company aims and objectives can benefit both managers and employees in a number of ways. Firstly, it provides direction and focus for the company and its employees, ensuring that everyone is working towards a common goal. This can help boost motivation and productivity within the company. Additionally, meeting objectives can also result in bonuses and incentives for employees, making them feel valued and motivated to work towards the company's success.\n\n@@@Potential conflicts with other business objectives  \nWhile the primary objective of Reuters is to increase value for its shareholders, this could potentially conflict with other objectives that the company might have. For instance, pursuing profit maximization could result in decisions that may not align with the needs and interests of other stakeholders, such as employees or the community. This potential conflict will be further discussed in chapter 5.\n\n@@@Maximizing short-term sales revenue  \nOne potential business objective that could conflict with the aim of maximising shareholder value is the goal of maximizing short-term sales revenue. While this may benefit managers and staff in terms of bonuses and salary increases, it could negatively impact the company's overall profitability. For example, reducing prices to increase sales can result in lower profits for the company.\n\n@@@Maximizing shareholder value  \nThis objective is often pursued by public limited companies and directs management to make decisions that would increase the company's share price and dividends paid to shareholders. However, this can result in a conflict with the interests of other stakeholders, as discussed earlier. It can also lead to a focus on profit maximization, which could potentially neglect the social and ethical responsibilities of the company.\n\n@@@Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)  \nIn recent years, there has been a growing trend for businesses to adopt objectives related to social, environmental, and ethical issues. This is known as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). There are various reasons for this trend, including pressure from stakeholders and changes in laws and regulations. This concept involves businesses taking responsibility for the impact of their decisions and activities on customers, employees, communities, and the environment.\n\n@@@Reasons for the trend in CSR  \nApart from external pressures, there are other reasons for the adoption of CSR objectives by businesses. Consumers and stakeholders are increasingly reacting favorably to companies that prioritize social and environmental concerns. This can result in increased profits for the company, but it is also a reflection of the growing importance placed on ethical and socially responsible behavior by businesses.\n\n@@@Criticism surrounding CSR  \nDespite its growing popularity, there are still criticisms surrounding the adoption of CSR objectives by businesses. Some argue that it is merely a strategic move to protect the company's reputation and trade, rather than a genuine concern for society and the environment. This skepticism from stakeholders will be further discussed in chapter 5.\n\n@@@Conclusion  \nIn conclusion, setting and achieving business objectives is vital for the success of a company. While maximizing shareholder value is often a primary objective, it is important for businesses to consider the interests of other stakeholders and adopt a wider perspective in their decision-making. The increasing trend of CSR objectives reflects the growing awareness and importance of social and environmental responsibility in the business world today.","83":" Objectives and decision-making\n@@@Objectives and Decision-Making\nEffective decision-making requires clear objectives. \nBusiness managers cannot decide on future plans of action - strategies - if they are uncertain of which direction they want to take the business in. This essential link between decisions and objectives is illustrated in the decision making framework model shown in Figure 4.4.\n\n@@@The Decision-Making Framework\nThe stages in this decision making framework are:\n1. Set Objectives\n2. Assess the Problem or Situation\n3. Gather Data about the Problem and Possible Solutions\n4. Consider All Decision Options\n5. Make the Strategic Decision\n6. Plan and Implement the Decision\n7. Review its Success against the Original Objectives\n\n@@@The Importance of Setting Objectives\nClearly, without setting relevant objectives at the start of this process, effective decision-making for the future of the business becomes impossible.\n\n### How Corporate Objectives Might Change\n@@@Changes in Corporate Objectives\nThere are many examples of businesses changing their corporate objectives over time. These are some of the reasons for this:\n\n1. A newly formed business may have satisfied the 'survival' objective by operating for several years, and now the owners wish to pursue objectives of growth or increased profit.\n2. The competitive and economic environment may change, so the entry into the market of a powerful rival or the start of an economic recession may lead a firm to switch from growth to survival as its main aim - or even just to revise its objectives for sales and profits downwards.\n3. A short-term objective of growth in sales or market share might be adapted to a longer-term objective of maximizing profits from the higher level of sales.\n\n### Factors Affecting Corporate Objectives\n@@@Factors Influencing Objectives\nThere are several factors that influence the nature of the objectives established for any business. Chief among these is the culture of the organization. This can be defined as the code of behavior and attitudes that influence the decision-making style of the managers and other employees of the business. \n\n@@@Corporate Culture\nCulture is a way of doing things that is shared by all those in the organization. It is about people, how they perform and deal with others, how aggressive they are in the pursuit of objectives, and how adaptable they are in the face of change. The culture of the organization can greatly impact the established objectives.\n\n@@@Size and Legal Form\nThe size and legal form of the business can also affect its objectives. For example, owners of small businesses may be concerned only with a satisfactory level of profit, while larger businesses may be more concerned with rapid growth. Additionally, public limited companies, controlled by directors rather than owners, may prioritize business growth in order to increase the status and power of managers.\n\n@@@Public vs. Private Sector\nState-owned organizations tend not to have profit as a major objective. The aims of these organizations can vary greatly, but when the service they provide is not charged for, such as education and health services, a financial target would be inappropriate. \n\n### The Decision-Making Framework\n@@@Introduction to the Decision-Making Framework\nThe decision-making framework (shown in Figure 4.4) is a useful tool for businesses to use when making strategic decisions. It consists of seven stages that guide the decision-making process.\n\n@@@The Seven Stages of the Decision-Making Framework\n1. Set Objectives (SMART)\n2. Assess and Clarify the Problem\n3. Gather Data to Analyze the Problem\n4. Consider Ideas and Options\n5. Use Appropriate Tools to Decide Between Options\n6. Plan and Implement the Decision\/Action\n7. Control and Review Against Objectives","84":"  \n\n@@@Corporate Objectives\nIn order for a business to achieve success, a clear set of objectives is necessary. Corporate objectives are the overall aims and targets that a business sets for itself, usually in alignment with its mission statement. These objectives can vary depending on the business, its size, and its legal form, but they all serve as guiding principles for decision-making and strategy development.\n### \n@@@Quality of Service Measures\nWhile corporate objectives focus on the overall aims and targets of the business, 'quality of service' measures are often used to track performance in specific areas. For example, a hospital may use the maximum number of days for a patient to wait for an operation as a measure to ensure high quality of service. This type of measure is also commonly used in businesses earning revenue in the public sector, such as a country's postal service. Maintaining services in non-profitable locations may be among their objectives.\n### \n@@@Business Objectives in the Public Sector\nEven businesses in the public sector may have objectives related to profitability and growth, despite not being driven by profits. For example, a postal service may still have targets related to maintaining services in non-profitable locations, as well as targets for cost-reduction and efficiency improvement. Recent branch closures in rural areas by private-sector banks, in contrast, may prioritize increasing profits.\n### \n@@@Impact of Years in Operation\nThe objectives of a business may change as it grows and becomes more established. Newly formed businesses are often driven by the desire to survive at all costs, with a high failure rate in the first year of operation. As the business becomes more established, it may shift its focus to other objectives, such as growth and profits. The impact of years in operation is shown in Figure 4.5, which highlights how different factors can influence corporate objectives.\n### \n@@@Hierarchal Structure of Objectives\nCorporate objectives relate to the whole organization and must be broken down into specific targets for divisions and departments in order to create effective strategies. This hierarchical structure of objectives is shown in Figure 4.6 and is crucial for coordination, consistency, and resource allocation within the organization. Management by objectives (MBO) is a process that can be used to ensure effective delegation of authority and motivation of staff at each level of the organization.\n### \n@@@Management by Objectives (MBO)\nMBO is a method for coordinating and motivating all staff in an organization by dividing its overall aim into specific targets for each department, manager, and employee. When implemented through discussion and mutual agreement, MBO can be an effective approach for delegating authority and energizing employees, as compatible with McGregor's Theory Y. However, when targets are imposed from above, as with McGregor's Theory X, motivation is likely to be low.\n### \n@@@Hierarchy of Objectives in Action\nFigure 4.6 illustrates how the hierarchy of objectives extends to every level of the organization, from the corporate aim to individual targets. The use of MBO principles in this hierarchy allows for effective coordination and motivation of staff in achieving the overall corporate objectives. However, it has been noted that the mission statement, while important for overall direction, may not be as critical for operational decision-making.","85":" \n@@@Ethical and Moral Dimensions in Business\nMost decisions made by businesses have ethical or moral implications. These can include advertising to children, accepting bribes, investing in controversial industries, and using certain practices or materials in production. These are all examples of ethical dilemmas that businesses face on a regular basis.\n\n@@@Evaluating Ethical Codes of Conduct\nTo address these ethical dilemmas, many companies have created codes of conduct outlining the expected behavior of their employees. This ensures that employees are aware of the company's ethical expectations and can make informed decisions when faced with ethical concerns. However, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of these codes in actually influencing decision-making and defining company culture.\n\n@@@Business Objectives and the Role of Communication\nEffective communication of business objectives is crucial in ensuring that employees understand and contribute to the company's goals. This communication should also translate into individual targets for each employee. This not only helps improve overall company performance, but also promotes a sense of shared responsibility among employees.\n\n@@@Benefits of Effective Communication\nWhen employees are properly informed and involved in the setting of individual targets, it can result in increased productivity, better understanding of the company's goals, a sense of shared responsibility, and easier management of employee progress.\n\n@@@Influence of Ethics on Business Objectives and Decision-Making\nThe concept of corporate social responsibility has led to an increased focus on ethical considerations in business. This has also led to the adoption of ethical codes by many companies, which outline the expected behavior of employees in decision-making processes. These codes can have a significant influence on the way business objectives are set and decisions are made.\n\n@@@Defining Ethical Codes of Conduct\nAn ethical code, also known as a code of conduct, is a document that outlines a company's rules and guidelines for employee behavior. This document is meant to be followed by all employees and aims to promote ethical decision-making and behavior within the company.\n\n@@@Different Corporate Cultures\nThe corporate culture of organizations can vary between private and public sectors. Private sector companies may prioritize profit and shareholder value, while public sector organizations may have a stronger focus on the well-being of society as a whole. This can also influence the adoption and effectiveness of ethical codes of conduct within these companies. \n\n@@@Examples of Ethical Dilemmas in Business \nSome examples of ethical dilemmas in business include companies exploiting weak legal controls in developing countries to pay low wages, the use of child labor to reduce costs, and the production of potentially dangerous goods as long as they remain unnoticed. These are all situations where ethical considerations may conflict with financial interests and require businesses to carefully consider their actions.","86":"\n\n\n@@@Introduction to Communication Methods\nCommunication is a crucial aspect of business operations, and managers must carefully consider the most effective methods for relaying information to their employees. While oral, written, and electronic methods each have their advantages, there are also drawbacks to consider. In this section, we will explore the different forms of communication and the factors that influence their appropriateness for different situations.\n\n@@@Oral Communication\nOral communication refers to the verbal exchange of information, whether in person or through technology such as video conferencing. It is often the preferred method for managers as it allows for immediate feedback and the use of body language to reinforce the message. However, there are some disadvantages to consider. For instance, oral communication can be ambiguous and may not be suitable for complex and technical matters. Additionally, there is no written record of what was said, making it difficult to refer back to the information.\n\n@@@Written Communication\nWritten communication, such as letters, memos, and reports, provides a permanent record of the information being shared. It is often the preferred method for managers who value accuracy and detail and need to transmit detailed data. However, written communication eliminates the use of body language and does not allow for immediate feedback. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the message has been received or understood.\n\n@@@IT and Electronic Media\nThe advancement of technology has given rise to various forms of electronic media that have revolutionized business communication. IT and web-based media, such as email, video\/web-conferencing, and social media, offer numerous benefits such as speed and a written record. However, there are also drawbacks, including the need for training, potential social isolation, loss of direct interpersonal contact, security issues, and the potential for information overload.\n\n@@@Visual Communication\nVisual communication involves the use of diagrams, pictures, and charts to accompany and support other forms of communication. It can be a powerful tool in training and marketing, as it increases the impact of the message. Advancements in technology have also made visual communication more accessible and practical.\n\n@@@Factors Influencing Choice of Communication Methods\nManagers must carefully assess various factors before deciding on the most appropriate communication method for a given situation. These include the need for a written record, the importance of sta ff input, cost, speed, quantity of data, the use of multiple methods, and the size and geographical spread of the business. A thorough evaluation of these factors is necessary to ensure effective communication within the organization.\n\n@@@Conclusion\nChoosing the most effective communication method is essential for managers to ensure that their message is received and understood by their employees. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, and the appropriateness of each should be carefully considered before making a decision. ","87":"\n\n@@@ Definition of Marketing in Contemporary Marketing Wired \n\n\"Another Definition From Contemporary Marketing Wired by Boone and Kurtz\"\n\nMarketing is a crucial and complex process that involves planning, managing, and executing various tasks to promote and distribute products and services. It aims to establish and maintain relationships with both individual and organizational customers to satisfy their needs. \n\n@@@ Marketing Functions \n\n\"Exploring the Management Functions in Marketing\"\n\nMarketing is a multi-faceted task that includes various interrelated management functions. These functions are essential to achieve the overall marketing goals and objectives. Some of these management functions include market research, product design, pricing, advertising, distribution, customer service, and packaging. \n\n@@@ The Significance of Marketing \n\n\"The Importance of Marketing as a Business Activity\"\n\nMarketing plays a crucial role in businesses as it is responsible for identifying and meeting the desires and needs of customers in a particular target market. To remain competitive, businesses must understand the changing market trends and consumer preferences. Hence, marketing is a vital business activity that enables businesses to stay relevant and satisfy their target market's needs effectively. \n\n@@@ Market, Markets, and the Electronic Marketplace \n\n\"Understanding the Different Concepts Related to Markets\"\n\nThe term \"market\" has two distinct meanings when it comes to marketing. It refers to the physical place or mechanism where buyers and sellers engage in exchange, such as shopping centers, auctions, and the internet. Additionally, the term \"market\" can also represent the group of consumers interested in a product, who have the resources to purchase it and are permitted by law to do so. \n\n@@@ Human Needs and Wants \n\n\"Distinguishing between Human Needs and Wants\"\n\nHuman needs are fundamental requirements that individuals have an innate desire to satisfy, such as food, clothing, and shelter. On the other hand, wants are broader and are not necessarily essential for survival. They are often described as goods and services that fulfill individual needs and desires, such as expensive or luxurious items. \n\n@@@ Value and Satisfaction \n\n\"Exploring the Concept of Value and Customer Satisfaction\"\n\nValue and satisfaction are critical factors in determining a consumer's perception of a product. Value is not solely based on the price, but it is the overall perception of how well a product meets the customer's needs at a reasonable cost. Customer satisfaction is the feeling of fulfillment or pleasure a consumer experiences after purchasing a product. It is not solely dependent on the product's price, but rather, its ability to meet the customer's expectations. \n\n@@@ Examples of Value and Satisfaction \n\n\"Illustrating the Importance of Value and Satisfaction\"\n\nValue and satisfaction are relative concepts and can vary from one individual to another. Two examples help demonstrate this point: a consumer may feel that a cheaper meal in a pizza cafe provides value because it satisfies their hunger, whereas a very expensive car may not provide long-term satisfaction despite being an excellent performer. ","88":" Alcoholic fermentation\n\n@@@Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity\nEnzymes are biological molecules that act as catalysts, speeding up chemical reactions in living organisms. Enzyme activity can be influenced by various factors, including enzyme inhibitors, substrate concentration, and temperature and pH changes.\n\n@@@Enzyme Activity can be Inhibited\nThe activity of enzymes can be inhibited by certain molecules known as enzyme inhibitors. These inhibitors can prevent the normal enzymatic reaction from taking place by binding to the enzyme or changing the shape of the enzyme's active site.\n\n@@@Competitive Inhibition\nCompetitive inhibitors are molecules that have a similar shape to the substrate molecules and are able to bind to the enzyme's active site. However, instead of participating in the reaction, they block the active site and prevent the substrate from binding. This inhibition can be overcome by increasing the concentration of the substrate.\n\n- Competitive inhibiton explained:\n1) Competitive inhibitor molecules have a similar shape to that of the substrate molecules.\n2) They compete with the substrate molecules to bind to the active site, but no reaction takes place.\n3) Instead they block the active site, so no substrate molecules can fit in it.\n4) How much the enzyme is inhibited depends on the relative concentrations of the inhibitor and the substrate.\n5) If there's a high concentration of the inhibitor, it'll take up nearly all the active sites and hardly any of the substrate wil get to the enzyme.\n6) But if there's a higher concentration of substrate, then the substrate's chances of getting to an active site before the inhibitor increase. So increasing the concentration of substrate will increase the rate of reaction (up to a point).\n\n@@@Non-Competitive Inhibition\nIn contrast, non-competitive inhibitors bind to the enzyme at a site away from the active site. This binding causes the active site to change shape, making it unable to bind to the substrate. Unlike competitive inhibition, increasing the concentration of the substrate will not have an effect on the rate of the reaction.\n\n- Non-competitive inhibition explained:\n1) Non-competitive inhibitor molecules bind to the enzyme away from its active site.\n2) This causes the active site to change shape so the substrate molecules can no longer bind to it.\n3) They don't 'compete' with the substrate molecules to bind to the active site because they are a different shape.\n4) Increasing the concentration of substrate won't make any difference to the reaction rate \u2014 enzyme activity will still be inhibited.\n\n@@@Practice Questions\n1) Draw a graph to show the effect of temperature on enzyme activity.\n2) Draw a graph to show the effect of pH on enzyme activity.\n3) Explain the effect of increasing substrate concentration on the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction.\n\n@@@Exam Question\nQ1 Inhibitors prevent enzymes from working properly. They can be competitive or non-competitive.\na) Explain how a competitive inhibitor works. [3 marks]\nb) Explain how a non-competitive inhibitor works. [2 marks]\n\n@@@Alcoholic Fermentation\nAlcoholic fermentation is a process that occurs in some yeasts and bacteria, converting sugar into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process is catalyzed by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, which is found in high concentrations in yeast.\n\n@@@Activity \u2014 mine is usually inhibited by pizza and a movie...\nThe normal functioning of human enzymes can be affected by external factors such as diet and lifestyle choices. For example, consuming certain foods like pizza or watching a movie can affect enzyme activity. In addition, some drugs and poisons can also act as enzyme inhibitors, disrupting important biological reactions in the body.\n\n@@@Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\nTopic 1A focuses on the various types and functions of biological molecules, including enzymes, carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Enzymes play a critical role in many biological processes, and an understanding of their activity and inhibition is essential in understanding the functioning of living organisms.","89":"@@@Direct Costs  \nDirect costs are those that can be specifically identified with each unit of production and can be allocated to a cost center. This means that these costs are clearly related to the production of a specific product or service. Examples of direct costs include the cost of raw materials, labor, and the salary of staff directly involved in the production process.\n\nOne example of a direct cost in a fast-food restaurant would be the cost of the meat used to make a hamburger. In a garage, the direct cost would be the labor cost of the mechanic servicing a car. In a school, the salary of the Business Studies teacher would be considered a direct cost. These costs are important to identify and track because they directly contribute to the production of a specific product or service.\n\n@@@Indirect Costs  \nIn contrast, indirect costs are those that cannot be specifically identified with a unit of production and cannot be allocated accurately to a cost center. These costs are often referred to as overheads and can include things like promotional expenditures, rent, and cleaning services. Indirect costs are not directly related to the production process, but they are necessary for the overall operation of a business.\n\nFor example, a farm may have an indirect cost in the form of purchasing a tractor. A supermarket may have indirect costs for promotional expenses. A garage would have indirect costs for rent, and a school would have indirect costs for cleaning services.\n\n@@@Fixed Costs  \nFixed costs are those that do not vary with the level of output in the short run. This means that regardless of the number of products or services being produced, the fixed costs will remain the same. Some examples of fixed costs include rent for premises and insurance.\n\n@@@Variable Costs  \nIn contrast, variable costs do vary with the level of output. These costs are directly related to the production process and can include things like raw materials, electricity, and wages for production workers. These costs will change as the level of output changes.\n\nSemi-variable costs are a combination of both fixed and variable costs. They include a fixed element, such as a standing charge for electricity, and a variable element, such as the cost per unit used.\n\n@@@Marginal Costs  \nMarginal costs are the additional costs of producing one more unit of output. This includes the extra variable costs needed to make one more unit, such as the cost of materials and labor. It is important for businesses to understand the marginal costs involved in producing one additional unit in order to make informed decisions about production.\n\n@@@Types of Costs  \nThere are several different types of costs that businesses must consider. These include direct costs, indirect costs, fixed costs, variable costs, and marginal costs.\n\nDirect costs and indirect costs are important for businesses to consider in order to accurately allocate costs to specific products or services. Fixed costs and variable costs are important to understand in order to make decisions about levels of production. And marginal costs are important to consider when making decisions about increasing or decreasing production. Overall, understanding different types of costs is crucial for making informed decisions and effectively managing a business.","90":"costs\n@@@ Problems in classifying costs\nClassifying costs is not an easy task and may not always be worthwhile, as some costs do not fit neatly into defined categories. \n@@@ Where labour costs do not fit \nLabour costs may not always be variable or directly related to a specific output. In times of low production, wages may still need to be paid, making them an overhead cost. Similarly, fixed-contract salaries cannot be allocated directly to output, such as in the case of a television presenter. Administrative, selling, and other staff salaries are also considered indirect costs that cannot be attributed to a particular product or service. \n@@@ Challenges in allocating telephone charges\nIn a busy factory setting, telephone charges may be allotted to each product range if accurate records are kept. However, in practice, this may not be feasible and these costs are usually considered as indirect overhead expenses. \nTOP TIP\nNot all direct costs are variable costs. For instance, if a hotel purchases a juicing machine for the bar department, this is a direct cost for that department but does not change with the number of orange juices being served.\n@@@ Break-even analysis\nBreak-even analysis is a useful tool in decision-making for businesses. It helps determine the level of output at which total costs equal total revenue, resulting in neither a profit nor a loss. \n@@@ Two methods of break-even analysis\nBreak-even analysis can be done in two ways: the graphical method and the equation method. \n@@@ Graphical method: the break-even chart\nThe break-even chart requires a graph with two axes, showing fixed costs, total costs, and sales revenue. It is drawn with the following key points in mind:\n- Fixed costs are represented by a horizontal line, as they do not vary with output.\n- Sales revenue starts at the origin because no sales can be made without producing goods.\n- The variable cost line also starts at the origin, as there are no variable costs without production. However, this line is typically omitted.\n- The total cost line starts at the level of fixed costs and increases with output due to variable costs.","91":"\n@@@Break-even point\nThe break-even point is the point where total costs and sales-revenue lines cross, indicating that sales revenue is equal to the total costs. This means that the business is neither making a profit nor a loss. The number of units produced and sold at this point is known as the break-even output. This is an important measure for businesses as it helps them to determine the level of production required to cover their costs and achieve profitability.\n\n@@@Margin of safety\nThe margin of safety is the amount by which the sales level exceeds the break-even level of output. It is a useful indication of how much sales could fall without the firm falling into loss. This measure is calculated by subtracting the break-even output from the current production level. A positive margin of safety indicates that the business is operating above the break-even point and is making a profit. On the other hand, a negative margin of safety means that the business is operating below the break-even point and is making a loss.\n\n@@@Classifying costs \nClassifying costs is an important exercise that helps businesses to analyze their expenses and make informed decisions. In a furniture manufacturing firm, there are various costs that need to be categorized into direct or indirect, fixed or variable. Direct costs are those that can be directly linked to a specific product or service, while indirect costs cannot be directly traced to a particular product or service. Fixed costs are expenses that do not vary with the level of production, while variable costs change as the level of production changes.\n\n@@@Cost classification\n1. Rent of factory: Indirect, fixed\n2. Management salaries: Indirect, fixed\n3. Electricity: Indirect, variable\n4. Piece-rate labor wages of production staff: Direct, variable\n5. Depreciation of equipment: Indirect, fixed\n6. Lease of company cars: Indirect, variable\n7. Wood and other materials used in production: Direct, variable\n8. Maintenance cost of special machine used to make one type of wooden chair: Direct, fixed\n\n@@@Explanation of cost classification\n- Rent of factory: This cost is considered indirect as it cannot be directly linked to the production of a specific product. It is also classified as a fixed cost as it remains constant regardless of the level of production.\n- Management salaries: Similar to rent, management salaries are also indirect and fixed because they do not vary with the level of production.\n- Electricity: This cost is classified as indirect as it cannot be directly traced to a specific product, but it is considered variable as it changes with the level of production.\n- Piece-rate labor wages of production staff: This cost is direct as it can be directly linked to the production of a specific product. It is also variable as it changes with the level of production.\n- Depreciation of equipment: This cost is indirect and fixed as it cannot be directly linked to a specific product and it remains constant regardless of the level of production.\n- Lease of company cars: Similar to electricity, this cost is classified as indirect and variable.\n- Wood and other materials used in production: This cost is direct and variable as it changes with the level of production.\n- Maintenance cost of special machine used to make one type of wooden chair: This cost is direct and fixed as it can be directly linked to the production of a specific product, but it remains constant regardless of the level of production.\n\n ","92":" Low-quality profit: one-off profit that cannot easily be repeated or sustained.\n@@@Types of Profit  \nThe concept of profit in business can be broken down into two main types: low-quality profit and high-quality profit. Low-quality profit refers to a profit that cannot easily be repeated or sustained, while high-quality profit is one that can be consistently repeated over time. It is important for a business to strive for high-quality profit in order to maintain long-term success and sustainability. \n\n@@@Statement of financial position  \nThe Statement of financial position is an important accounting statement that shows the net wealth or shareholders\u2019 equity of a business at a specific moment in time. It is also known as the balance sheet, but IFRS rules have led to a name-change for this account. The main purpose of this statement is to record the values of a business's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity. \n\n@@@Key Terms  \nIn order to understand the Statement of financial position, there are some key terms that are important to know. These include shareholders\u2019 equity, assets, liabilities, share capital, and retained earnings. Shareholders\u2019 equity is the total value of a business\u2019s assets subtracted by its total liabilities. Assets refer to items of monetary value that are owned by the business, while liabilities are financial obligations that must be paid in the future. Share capital is the total amount of capital raised from shareholders, and retained earnings are the profits that have been accumulated over time through the operations of the business. \n\n@@@Components of a Statement of financial position  \nThe Statement of financial position is made up of several components, including non-current assets, intangible assets, current assets, inventories, trade receivables, current liabilities, and non-current liabilities. Non-current assets are assets that are expected to be used by the business for more than one year. In the past, these were known as fixed assets. Intangible assets are assets that do not have a physical presence, such as patents and trademarks. Current assets are assets that are likely to be turned into cash within a year, while inventories refer to the stocks held by the business. Trade receivables are the value of payments that are expected to be received from customers who have bought goods on credit. On the liabilities side, current liabilities are debts that must be paid within a year, and non-current liabilities refer to debts that will be paid after more than one year. \n\n@@@Important Points  \nThere are some important points to note about the Statement of financial position. First, companies must also publish the income statement for the previous financial year in order to allow for easy comparison. It is also important to carefully consider the titles of both the income statement and the Statement of financial position, as they help identify both the account and the company. Additionally, while the income statement covers the entire financial year, the Statement of financial position reflects the estimated value of the company at a specific moment in time \u2013 the end of the financial year. \n\n@@@Top Tip  \nWhen analyzing or interpreting accounts, it is common for the Statement of financial position to be presented in a format similar to the one used in this book. This allows for easy comparison and understanding of the components of the statement. It is also important to note that the horizontal format is not typically used in financial analysis. \n\n@@@Non-current or fixed assets  \nNon-current or fixed assets are assets that are expected to be used by the business for more than one year. These are the most common examples of fixed assets: land, buildings, vehicles, and machinery. Intangible assets, on the other hand, cannot be seen but still hold value in the business. Examples of intangible assets include patents, trademarks, copyrights, and goodwill.","93":"\n@@@Analyzing Buyer Power\nBuyers are a key factor in determining the power of the food and other producers in the industry. In this section, we will discuss the various factors that influence buyer power and how they can contribute to a strong or weak position for the producers. This includes the level of differentiation among suppliers, the ease of switching suppliers, and the availability of alternative suppliers.\n###\n@@@The Power of Suppliers\nSuppliers hold a significant amount of power in the industry and their influence is often compared to that of buyers. In this section, we will outline the key factors that can make suppliers more powerful, such as the high cost of switching, strong brand recognition, and the ability to independently start their own operations.\n###\n@@@Threat of Substitutes\nThe threat of substitutes is an important aspect of Porter's Five Forces framework and can have a significant impact on an industry. In this section, we will discuss the different types of substitutes and how they can affect the demand for a certain product. This includes the impact of new technology, price competition, and changing consumer spending patterns.\n###\n@@@Competitive Rivalry\nCompetitive rivalry is at the heart of Porter's Five Forces analysis and is influenced by all the other forces discussed in this framework. In this section, we will examine the key factors that contribute to high levels of competition within an industry, such as easy entry for new firms, strong buyer and supplier power, and the presence of a large number of similar firms.\n###\n@@@Porter's Five Forces as a Framework for Business Strategy\nIn this section, we will explore how the analysis of Porter's Five Forces can help businesses make crucial strategic decisions. This includes evaluating new markets, deciding whether to stay in existing markets, and finding ways to improve their competitive position. We will also discuss the potential impact of strategic decisions made based on this framework.\n###\n@@@Evaluating the Success of Four Strategies\nIn this section, we will evaluate the potential success of four strategies identified in the text. This includes product differentiation, buying out competitors, targeting niche markets, and collaborating with rivals. We will also discuss the important factors that can influence the success of these strategies, such as market competition, consumer demand, and the effectiveness of implementation.","94":"\n\n@@@Introduction\nStrategic analysis allows a company to assess the current state of its product portfolio and make decisions about where to allocate resources. One tool commonly used for strategic analysis is the Boston Matrix, which categorizes products based on their market growth and market share. This tool can help a company identify which products are performing well and which may need additional support or corrective action. However, the Boston Matrix is just one part of strategic analysis and must be used in conjunction with other factors such as competitor decisions and market trends.\n\n@@@High market growth - high market share: Product A - 'cash cow'\nOne category of the Boston Matrix is products with high market growth and high market share. These products, also known as 'cash cows', have substantial consumer awareness and generate a consistent stream of cash. As a result, a company can allocate resources from this product to support other products in its portfolio.\n\n@@@High market growth - high market share: Product B - 'star'\nAnother category of the Boston Matrix is products with high market growth and high market share, known as 'stars'. These products perform well in an expanding market and generate significant income for the company. To maintain their position in a fast-changing market, companies often invest heavily in promotion and brand differentiation.\n\n@@@High market growth - low market share: Product C - 'problem child'\nThe 'problem child' is a type of product in the Boston Matrix characterized by high market growth but low market share. These products require significant resources, particularly in terms of promotion, to become established in the market. Companies may use profits from 'cash cow' products to finance the development of 'problem child' products. If sales do not improve, companies may need to make quick decisions such as redesigning or relaunching the product, or even withdrawing it from the market.\n\n@@@Low market growth - low market share: Product D - 'dog'\nA 'dog' is a product with low market growth and low market share. These products do not contribute significantly to a company's sales or cash flow and may not have promising future prospects. In such cases, companies may need to replace the product or consider withdrawing from the market altogether.\n\n@@@Application of the Boston Matrix\nThrough the use of the Boston Matrix, companies can analyze their product portfolio and determine which products require support or corrective action. The matrix provides a framework for strategic decision-making and can result in various strategies, such as building, holding, milking, or divesting products.\n\n@@@Building - supporting 'problem child' products\nOne strategy derived from the Boston Matrix is building, where a company provides additional support to 'problem child' products through increased advertising or distribution outlets. This investment may be financed by profits from 'cash cow' products.\n\n@@@Holding - maintaining 'star' products\nThe holding strategy involves continuing to support 'star' products to maintain their strong market position. This may involve refreshing the product to keep up with changing consumer preferences and sustain high sales growth.\n\n@@@Milking - investing profits into other products\nTaking the positive cash flow from established products, companies may use the milking strategy to reinvest in other products in their portfolio. This can help diversify the business and support growth.\n\n@@@Divesting - withdrawing 'dogs'\nFinally, the divesting strategy involves identifying and ending production of underperforming 'dog' products. However, this decision should be considered carefully, as it can have significant implications for the company, such as workforce impact and the use of spare capacity.\n\n@@@Evaluating the Boston Matrix\nWhile the Boston Matrix is a valuable analytical tool, there are limitations to its use. It is most effective when analyzing existing product portfolios, planning for existing products, and introducing new products. However, it cannot predict future success and must be used in conjunction with other factors such as market research and competitor actions.\n\n@@@Conclusion\nThe Boston Matrix is a useful tool for strategic analysis, allowing companies to categorize their products based on market growth and market share. By identifying the current state of their product portfolio, companies can make decisions about where to allocate resources and how to manage their products for maximum success. However, the Boston Matrix should not be used in isolation and must be considered alongside other factors in strategic decision-making.","95":" Introduction\n@@@Introduction\nAs individuals plan for their future careers, it is crucial for them to take into account the current environment and the potential impact it may have on their aspirations. Strategic analysis serves as a tool to assess the current situation and prepare for future opportunities and challenges. This chapter will explore the key role of strategic analysis in strategic management for business organizations.\n\n### Strategic Analysis \n@@@Strategic Analysis\nStrategic analysis involves conducting research on both the external business environment and the organization itself.

How can the business respond to potential changes?\nThese questions form the foundation of strategic analysis, enabling managers to form strategies that align with the organization's external environment.\n\n### SWOT Analysis \n@@@SWOT Analysis\nOne of the main tools used in strategic analysis is SWOT analysis. It provides a comprehensive understanding of the business's internal strengths and weaknesses and external opportunities and threats. By identifying these factors, businesses can develop strategies and gain a competitive edge.\n\n#### Strengths \n@@@Strengths\nStrengths are the internal factors that give a business an advantage over its competitors. These could include experienced management, product patents, a loyal workforce, and a good product range. Identifying strengths requires conducting an internal audit of the organization, usually by specialists, to assess the overall effectiveness of the business and its departments.\n\n#### Weaknesses \n@@@Weaknesses\nWeaknesses are internal factors that may have a negative impact on the business. In some cases, they can be the opposite of strengths. Examples of weaknesses include a poorly trained workforce, limited production capacity, and outdated equipment. These factors are also identified through internal audits.\n\n#### Opportunities \n@@@Opportunities\nOpportunities are potential areas for growth and increased profitability. External audits of the market and its major competitors can identify these opportunities. Examples of opportunities include new technologies, expanding export markets, and increased consumer demand.\n\n#### Threats \n@@@Threats\nThreats are external factors that could harm the business. They are also identified through external audits, which analyze the business and economic environment, market conditions, and competition strength. Examples of threats include new competitors, globalization, changes in laws or policies, and economic factors.\n\n### Utilizing SWOT Analysis for Strategic Objectives \n@@@Utilizing SWOT Analysis for Strategic Objectives\nThe SWOT diagram serves as a starting point for developing new corporate strategies. However, it is not a sufficient tool on its own, and further analysis and planning are usually required to make strategic decisions. The grid approach, accompanied by a brief outline of each element, can assist managers in assessing potential strategies and constraints. In some cases, businesses can overcome weaknesses to capitalize on opportunities, creating a competitive advantage. \n","96":"\n\n@@@The Chemistry of Life\nThe field of biology is closely intertwined with the principles of chemistry, specifically the chemistry of life. Understanding the fundamental chemistry behind the biological processes is essential for any student of biology. In this section, we will explore the basics of chemistry that are relevant for biological systems.\n\n@@@Covalent Bonding\nOne of the most important types of chemical reaction in biology is the covalent bonding. In such reactions, the atoms involved share electrons, resulting in the formation of molecules. These covalent bonds are incredibly strong and the resulting molecules are typically neutral. However, in certain cases, the molecules formed can be slightly polarized, creating a dipole. This means that the electrons in the covalent bond are not evenly shared, causing one part of the molecule to be slightly negative and another part slightly positive. This separation of charge is represented by the symbols \u03b4+ and \u03b4\u2013. These types of polar molecules are particularly common when hydrogen atoms are involved.\n\n\u25b2fig D The formation of hydrogen molecules and water molecules are examples of covalent bonding.\n\n@@@The Importance of Inorganic Ions\nInorganic ions play a crucial role in the functioning of living organisms. When ionic substances dissolve in water, they separate into positively and negatively charged ions. Since cells are mostly composed of water, these ions play specialized roles within individual cells and the entire organism. In the following subsections, we will discuss some of the important inorganic ions and their functions.\n\n@@@Important Anions\nNitrates (NO3\u2212) are essential for plants as they are needed in the production of DNA, amino acids, and proteins from the products of photosynthesis. Similarly, phosphate ions (PO43\u2212) are vital for all living organisms as they are a crucial component of ATP, ADP, DNA, and RNA. Chloride ions (Cl\u2212) play a role in nerve impulses, sweating, and many secretory systems in animals, while hydrogen carbonate ions (HCO3\u2212) are necessary for buffering blood pH to prevent it from becoming too acidic.\n\n@@@Important Cations\nSodium ions (Na+) are crucial for the proper functioning of nerve impulses, sweating, and secretory systems in animals. Calcium ions (Ca2+) are necessary for the formation of calcium pectate for the middle lamella in plant cells, as well as for bone formation and muscle contraction in animals. Hydrogen ions (H+) play a significant role in cellular respiration, photosynthesis, and maintaining pH balance. Magnesium ions (Mg2+) are essential for the production of chlorophyll in plants.\n\n\u25b2fig C Animals such as cows can use a mineral lick to get the salt they need to function.\n\n@@@Exam Hint\nUnderstanding the distinction between ionic substances, charged particles, and polar molecules is critical for success in studying biology.

These organic compounds contain carbon, hydrogen, and varying amounts of other elements like oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. \n@@@What are Organic Compounds?\nOrganic compounds are molecules essential to the structure and function of living organisms. They are distinguished by the presence of carbon atoms, along with hydrogen, oxygen, and sometimes other elements like nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. These compounds make up a significant portion of living matter, and understanding their unique properties is crucial for understanding biological molecules like carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins.\n@@@Carbon Bonding and Macromolecules\nCarbon atoms are unique in their ability to form up to four bonds, allowing them to connect with multiple other atoms. They are particularly strong in bonding with other carbon atoms, forming long chains. Carbon compounds can have a variety of shapes, including rings, branched chains, and other 3D formations. This flexibility in structure allows for the creation of macromolecules through the bonding of monomers, leading to the complexity seen in living things.\n@@@Drawing Carbon Compounds\nTo represent the complex 3D structures of carbon compounds, various methods are used in molecular diagrams. These include simplified representations that focus on the connections between atoms rather than their exact shape.\n@@@LEARNING OBJECTIVES\nThe learning objectives for this section include understanding the differences between monosaccharides and disaccharides, utilizing Benedict's reagent, and identifying the process of condensation and hydrolysis in glucose, fructose, galactose, maltose, sucrose, and lactose.\n@@@CARBOHYDRATES\nCarbohydrates play crucial roles in cells, providing a source of energy and forming an essential part of the cell wall in plants, fungi, and bacteria. Among the most well-known carbohydrates are sugars like glucose, fructose, and sucrose, as well as starch found in common foods like rice and potatoes. However, there are many more compounds that fall under the carbohydrate category.\n@@@Monosaccharides: The Simple Sugars\nMonosaccharides are simple sugars with a ratio of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms for each carbon atom. Their general formula is (CH2O)n, where n is usually a small number. Triose sugars, for example, have three carbon atoms and are important in cellular respiration. Other monosaccharides include pentose and hexose sugars, which are essential in biological processes and as energy sources.

These molecules range in complexity from simple sugars to extremely large and complex structures, known as polysaccharides. Each type of carbohydrate plays a specific role in providing and storing energy for cells.\n@@@Polysaccharides \nPolysaccharides are the most complex carbohydrates, consisting of many monosaccharide units joined together by condensation reactions. These reactions create glycosidic bonds, which are essential for the formation of large and complex polymers. Polysaccharides do not have a sweet taste like simple sugars, but they play important biological roles.\n@@@Oligosaccharides and True Polysaccharides\nOligosaccharides are carbohydrates with 3 to 10 sugar units, while true polysaccharides contain 11 or more monosaccharides. These long chains of monosaccharides are used for energy storage and provide efficiency for cellular respiration. The glycosidic bonds in polysaccharides can be broken down to release monosaccharide units for cellular respiration through a process known as hydrolysis.\n@@@The Process of Hydrolysis\nHydrolysis is the process of breaking down glycosidic bonds in polysaccharides by adding water. This reaction is the opposite of the condensation reaction that links monosaccharide units together. The breakdown of polysaccharides results in shorter and shorter chains until single sugars remain. Hydrolysis takes place during digestion in the gut, and also in muscle and liver cells when energy stores are needed for cellular respiration. \n@@@Carbohydrates and Energy \nAll cellular processes require energy, which is supplied by a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The breakdown of glucose, a monosaccharide, through cellular respiration provides the necessary energy for these processes. As glucose is broken down, waste products such as carbon dioxide and water are produced, along with a large amount of ATP. This energy is used for all reactions in a cell. \n@@@Types of Carbohydrates and Their Functions \nEach type of carbohydrate has a specific role in providing and storing energy for cells. Monosaccharides and disaccharides, such as glucose and maltose, are used for immediate energy needs. Polysaccharides, like starch and glycogen, are stored forms of energy that can be broken down into smaller units when needed. The structure of each carbohydrate is related to its specific function in providing and storing energy. \n@@@Important Learning Objectives\nThis section covers important learning objectives related to carbohydrates, including understanding the differences between monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides, and their roles in energy production and storage.

In this experiment, we will be using catalase to catalyze the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. The volume of oxygen produced can be measured and used to calculate the rate of reaction.\n\n@@@Measuring the Rate of Reaction\nThe diagram below shows the apparatus needed for this experiment. It is important to keep the pH constant, so a buffer solution should be added to each boiling tube along with the same volume and concentration of hydrogen peroxide. The oxygen produced can be measured by displacing water in a measuring cylinder. The experiment can be repeated at different temperatures, and a negative control should also be carried out to ensure accurate results.\n\n@@@Calculating the Average Rate of Reaction\nTo calculate the average rate of reaction, the volume of oxygen produced must be divided by the time taken. This experiment can be repeated at different temperatures to investigate the effects of temperature on the rate of reaction.\n\nAnother way to measure the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction is by measuring how fast the substrate is broken down. In the next section, we will explore this method.\n\nTopic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n###14Enzyme-Controlled Reactions\nYou Can Measure How Fast the Substrate is Broken Down\nThe enzyme amylase catalyzes the breakdown of starch to maltose. To measure the rate of this reaction, the amylase and starch mixture is sampled each minute and a drop of iodine in potassium iodide is added to the spotting tile. The resulting color change can be used to record the speed at which amylase is working. This experiment can be repeated at different concentrations of amylase to investigate the relationship between enzyme concentration and rate of reaction.\n\n@@@Investigating Other Variables\nAside from temperature and enzyme concentration, other variables can also affect the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction. For example, you can investigate the effect of pH by adding a buffer solution with different pH levels to each test tube. Another variable that can be explored is substrate concentration, which can be achieved by using serial dilutions to make solutions with different concentrations.

","100":"\n@@@INTRODUCTION\nChemistry for Biologists aims to provide an in-depth understanding of how living organisms function on a molecular level. In order to do so, it is important to explore the different types of molecules that make up living organisms. One class of molecules that is essential for life is carbohydrates.\n\n@@@CARBOHYDRATES IN DIET\nCarbohydrates, or sugars, are a major source of energy for living organisms. Mono- and disaccharides, such as glucose, fructose, maltose, and sucrose, can be quickly absorbed and converted to glucose for immediate use by cells. These carbohydrates are easily soluble in water and provide a quick source of energy, but cannot be stored for later use.\n\n@@@POLYSACCHARIDES AS ENERGY STORAGE\nOn the other hand, polysaccharides are more complex carbohydrates that are ideal for energy storage within cells. They have several advantageous properties:\n\u2022 They are compact and take up little space.\n\u2022 They are chemically inert and do not interfere with cellular functions.\n\u2022 They are insoluble in water and do not alter water balance within cells.\n\n@@@STARCH IN PLANTS\nOne important type of polysaccharide is starch, which is the primary energy storage molecule in plants. During photosynthesis, the sugars produced are rapidly converted to starch for storage. Starch is insoluble and compact, making it an efficient storage molecule. Root vegetables, such as yams, are particularly rich in starch.\n\n@@@STRUCTURE OF STARCH\nStarch is composed of long chains of glucose molecules, but there are two types of molecules within starch that serve different functions:\n\u2022 Amylose is an unbranched polymer of glucose that forms a spiral structure, making it more compact for storage.\n\u2022 Amylopectin is a branched polymer of glucose with many terminal glucose units that can be rapidly broken down for energy.\n\n@@@DIFFERENCES IN STARCH STRUCTURE\nDespite both being composed of long chains of \u03b1-glucose, amylose and amylopectin have different structures due to the types of glycosidic bonds involved. Amylose only has 1,4-glycosidic bonds, resulting in unbranched molecules. Amylopectin, on the other hand, has both 1,4-glycosidic and 1,6-glycosidic bonds, resulting in branched molecules.\n\n@@@FUNCTION OF STARCH\nThe unique structure of starch contributes to its function as an efficient storage molecule for energy. Its coiled structure allows for compact storage, while its insolubility and inertness do not interfere with cellular functions. Furthermore, the different types of glycosidic bonds in amylose and amylopectin allow for the release of glucose at different rates, providing a sustained source of energy.\n\n@@@TESTING FOR STARCH\nA common method for testing for the presence of starch is to use iodine solution, which turns a blue-black color in the presence of polysaccharides. Starch, containing both amylose and amylopectin, is particularly effective in releasing glucose for cellular respiration and is a key component in carbohydrate-rich foods commonly consumed by athletes and active individuals.","101":"\n\n@@@CARBOHYDRATES\nCarbohydrates are organic molecules consisting of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. They are an essential source of energy for living organisms and can also serve as structural components in cells. In this section, we will discuss the specific role of carbohydrates in biological systems.\n\n@@@GLYCOGEN: ANIMAL STARCH\nGlycogen is a type of complex carbohydrate that is commonly known as \"animal starch.\" It is the main carbohydrate energy store found in animals, and is also important in fungi. In the following subsections, we will examine the chemical and structural properties of glycogen and its significance in biological processes. \n\n@@@STRUCTURE OF GLYCOGEN \nChemically, glycogen is similar to starch, specifically the amylopectin molecules found in starch. Like starch, glycogen is made up of many \u03b1-glucose units and is very compact. However, the key difference between glycogen and amylopectin is the number of 1,6-glycosidic bonds present. Glycogen has more 1,6-glycosidic bonds, giving it many side branches. This unique structure allows glycogen to be broken down rapidly, making it an ideal source of glucose for animals during periods of high activity.\n\n@@@FUNCTION OF GLYCOGEN IN ANIMALS\nGlycogen is stored in the liver and muscles of animals, particularly in times of excess glucose in the body. When blood glucose levels are low, glycogen can be broken down through hydrolysis to provide a quick source of glucose for cellular respiration. This is essential for maintaining energy levels during periods of high physical activity.\n\n@@@NUCLEUS AND GLYCOGEN GRANULES \nIn a micrograph of liver cells, small glycogen granules can be seen stained pink. These granules are the storage form of glycogen in the liver. When the body requires glucose, the glycogen stores can be broken down to release this essential energy source.\n\n@@@DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AMYLOSE, AMYLOPECTIN, AND GLYCOGEN\nIn comparison to the more linear structure of amylose and amylopectin, glycogen has many more branches. This is clearly visible when comparing the molecules in figure F. This unique structure allows glycogen to be broken down quickly and efficiently, making it an important storage molecule for animals.\n\n@@@CARBOHYDRATES AND ENERGY STORAGE\nCarbohydrates play a crucial role in storing energy for living organisms. In animals, glycogen serves as a short-term energy store, while in plants, starch serves as a long-term energy store. The structure of these carbohydrates is directly related to their function as energy storage molecules, providing the fuel for cellular respiration. \n\n@@@FACTORS THAT IMPACT ENERGY STORAGE\nCertain factors, such as the number and type of glycosidic bonds, can impact the efficiency of energy storage in carbohydrates. For example, the presence of many 1,6-glycosidic bonds in glycogen allows for quick energy release, making it a valuable source of glucose for animals. \n\n@@@CHECKPOINT \n1. Immediate energy sources, such as glucose and sucrose, can provide a quick burst of energy but are not suitable for long-term energy stores due to their simple structure. \n2. The unique structure of glycogen, with its many branches and 1,6-glycosidic bonds, allows for quick energy release, making it an ideal energy storage molecule for animals.\n\n@@@EXAM HINT\nBeware of confusing 1,4-glycosidic bonds and 1,6-glycosidic links. These two types of bonds have different functions and distinguishing between them is important in understanding carbohydrate structures. \n\n@@@DID YOU KNOW? \nThe coiling of starch molecules is essential for its abilities to thicken and glue due to its ability to unwind and tangle when cooked. \n\n@@@VOCABULARY \nOligosaccharides are molecules consisting of 3-10 monosaccharide units. \nHydrolysis is a reaction in which bonds are broken by adding a molecule of water. \nATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a universal energy supply molecule in all cells. \nEnd products refer to the final products of a chemical reaction. \nAmylose is a complex carbohydrate made up of \u03b1-glucose monomers joined by 1,4-glycosidic bonds, resulting in long unbranched chains. \nAmylopectin is a complex carbohydrate consisting of \u03b1-glucose monomers joined by 1,4-glycosidic bonds with additional 1,6-glycosidic bonds, resulting in a branched structure. \nGlycogen is a complex carbohydrate composed of many \u03b1-glucose units joined by 1,4-glycosidic bonds with numerous 1,6-glycosidic bonds, giving it many side branches.","102":"\n\n@@@Introduction\nLipids are organic substances that have a critical role in the functioning of organisms. They function as a component of cell membranes and serve as an energy reserve. The oxidation of lipids is a key process in cellular respiration, leading to the production of ATP. This section will discuss the important role of lipids in living organisms.\n\n@@@Fats and Oils\nFats and oils are essential types of lipids that play a significant role in the storage and transportation of energy. Chemically similar, these two groups of lipids have important differences in their physical properties. For instance, while fats are solid at room temperature, oils are liquid. Furthermore, they are sourced from different origins, with fats mainly from animals and oils from plants.\n\n@@@Composition of Lipids\nLike carbohydrates, lipids are made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. However, lipids contain a much lower proportion of oxygen compared to carbohydrates. Fats and oils consist of fatty acids and glycerol, which are joined via ester bonds. Glycerol, with the chemical formula C3H8O3, is a key component in the structure of lipids.\n\n@@@Types of Fatty Acids\nFatty acids are crucial components of lipids, and there are over 70 different types found in living tissues. They are characterized by a long hydrocarbon chain with a carboxyl group at one end. Fatty acids can differ in length and saturation, with saturated fatty acids having single covalent bonds and unsaturated fatty acids having double covalent bonds between carbon atoms. Examples of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, such as stearic acid and linoleic acid, will be discussed in this section.\n\n@@@Synthesis of Triglycerides\nA triglyceride is a type of lipid made up of glycerol and three fatty acids. The synthesis of triglycerides occurs through the formation of ester bonds during condensation reactions between glycerol and fatty acids. This process is essential in the storage and transportation of energy in cells.\n\n@@@Comparison of Unsaturated and Saturated Fatty Acids\nUnsaturated and saturated fatty acids have significant differences in their chemical structures and properties. While saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature, unsaturated fatty acids are liquid. This is due to the presence of double bonds in the carbon chain of unsaturated fatty acids. In this section, we will explore the differences between these two types of fatty acids in more detail.\n\n@@@Learning Objectives\nThe learning objectives of this section include an understanding of the synthesis of triglycerides and the differences between unsaturated and saturated fatty acids. These objectives are essential in providing a comprehensive understanding of lipids and their role in living organisms.","103":"\n\n@@@Introduction \nThis section will discuss the chemistry of lipids, specifically the formation of ester bonds, and the effect of different fatty acids on the properties of lipids.\n\n@@@Forming ester bonds \nTriglycerides, a type of lipid, are formed when glycerol combines with three fatty acids. This process involves a condensation reaction between the carboxyl group of a fatty acid and one of the hydroxyl groups of the glycerol. This reaction results in the formation of an ester bond, with a molecule of water being removed. This type of reaction is known as esterification.\n\n@@@Diversity in lipid formation \nThe type of lipid formed depends on the specific fatty acids that are joined together during esterification. For instance, lipids containing saturated fatty acids are more likely to be solid at room temperature compared to those containing unsaturated fatty acids. Additionally, longer chain fatty acids also tend to create solid fats.\n\n@@@Chemical representation of fatty acids \nFatty acids are usually represented by a general formula where the hydrocarbon chain is denoted by \"R.\" However, for simplicity, fatty acids are often drawn in reverse form, with the carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) at the end of the chain.\n\n@@@Difference between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids \nSaturated fatty acids have only single covalent bonds between carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon chain, while unsaturated fatty acids have one or more double covalent bonds. This difference greatly impacts the properties of the resulting lipids.\n\n@@@Effect of unsaturated fatty acids on lipid properties \nUnsaturated fatty acids create lipids that are more likely to be liquid at room temperature compared to lipids formed from saturated fatty acids. This is due to the presence of double bonds, which introduce kinks into the hydrocarbon chain and prevent the molecules from packing tightly together.\n\n@@@Subject Vocabulary \nThis section defines and provides examples of key vocabulary related to lipids and fatty acids, such as lipids themselves, fatty acids, and ester bonds.\n\n@@@Exam tip \nThis tip reminds students to be clear in discussing unsaturated fatty acids, specifically referring to the double bonds as carbon-carbon double bonds.\n\n@@@Learning Tip\nThis section advises students to keep in mind the physical differences between animal and plant fats when studying lipids.\n\n@@@Skills Adaptive Learning \nThis section focuses on the adaptive learning aspect of studying lipids, emphasizing the importance of understanding unsaturated fatty acids in relation to carbon-carbon double bonds.\n\n","104":"\n@@@Proteins and Their Importance  \nProteins are an essential and diverse group of macromolecules found in all living organisms. They make up approximately 18% of the human body and play a vital role in various bodily functions. In this section, we will discuss the importance of proteins in the human body and how understanding their structure can provide insight into the intricate biology of cells and organisms.\n\n@@@The Composition and Structure of Proteins  \nLike carbohydrates and lipids, proteins are made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. In addition, they also contain nitrogen and many proteins also contain sulfur. Proteins consist of smaller units called amino acids, which join together through a process known as condensation to form long chains. There are about 20 different naturally occurring amino acids that can combine in various ways, producing a wide range of diverse proteins.\n\n@@@The Role of Amino Acids in Protein Formation  \nAll amino acids share a similar basic structure, consisting of an amino group (\u2013NH2) and a carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) attached to a central carbon atom. The varying component of amino acids is the R group, which differs between amino acids and affects the way they interact with one another in a protein molecule. The properties of the R group, such as its polarity, play a significant role in determining the tertiary structure of the protein.\n\n@@@Learning Objectives for Proteins  \nBefore diving into the formation and bonds of proteins, it is essential to understand the primary structure of amino acids and how it influences the secondary and tertiary structures of proteins. In this section, we will outline the key learning objectives for understanding proteins, such as the basic structure of an amino acid, peptide bond formation, and the significance of a protein's primary structure in determining its properties and functions.\n\n@@@Forming Proteins from Amino Acids  \nAmino acids join together through condensation reactions, in which a molecule of water is released, to form peptide bonds. The resulting product is a dipeptide, and as more amino acids join, polypeptide chains are formed. These long chains then undergo structural changes, such as folding or coiling, to form a functional protein.\n\n@@@The Role of Bonds in Protein Structure  \nBesides peptide bonds, other types of bonds form between the amino acids in a protein chain to create its 3D structure. These bonds are dependent on the R group and include hydrogen, disulfide, and ionic bonds. Understanding the roles of these bonds is crucial in comprehending the properties and functions of different proteins.","105":"\n@@@17 1A.5 PROTEINS CHEMISTRY FOR BIOLOGISTS\n\n@@@HYDROGEN BONDS\nHydrogen bonds play a crucial role in protein structures. These weak bonds form between the negatively charged oxygen of carboxyl groups and the positively charged hydrogen atoms of amino groups. They are responsible for holding the protein together firmly and are crucial in the folding and coiling of polypeptide chains. Hydrogen bonds are easily broken and reformed in response to changes in pH or temperature.\n\n@@@DISULFIDE BONDS\nCompared to hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds are much stronger and occur less frequently. These covalent bonds form between two cysteine molecules and play a vital role in maintaining the folded structure of polypeptide chains.\n\n@@@IONIC BONDS\nIonic bonds can also form between certain amino acid side chains deep within the protein molecule. These bonds are strong but not as common as hydrogen or disulfide bonds.\n\n@@@AFFECTS OF TIME ON PROTEIN STRUCTURES\nVarious styling techniques, such as blow drying and straightening, can alter the bonds within the protein molecules in hair. These methods break and reform hydrogen bonds, causing temporary changes in hair texture.\n\n@@@PERMING AND ITS PERMANENT EFFECTS\nPerming, on the other hand, causes a permanent change in the structure of hair. This chemical treatment breaks disulfide bonds and reforms them in a different location, resulting in a new style that lasts until the hair is cut.\n\n@@@PROTEIN STRUCTURE\nProteins can be described by their primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure. The primary structure is the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain, held together by peptide bonds. Secondary structure refers to the regular, repeating 3D structure of the polypeptide chain, held together by hydrogen bonds. This can take the form of an \u03b1-helix or a \u03b2-pleated sheet. Fibrous proteins typically have this type of structure. Finally, some proteins have no regular secondary structure and form a random coil.","106":"\n@@@Protein Structures\nProteins are complex molecules that are made up of chains of amino acids. These chains can be folded into different shapes, which determines the structure and function of the protein. There are four levels of organization in protein structure: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.\n@@@Primary Structure\nThe primary structure of a protein refers to the linear sequence of amino acids in the peptide chain. This sequence is determined by the genetic code and can vary in length and composition for different proteins. \n@@@Secondary Structure\nThe secondary structure is the next level of organization, and it describes the repeating pattern of the peptide chains. This can take the form of an \u03b1-helix or \u03b2-pleated sheets, which are stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the amino acids. The R groups of the amino acids do not affect the secondary structure.\n@@@Tertiary Structure\nThe tertiary structure is another level of 3D organization in addition to the secondary structure. In this level, the protein chain is folded into a complex shape, often with \u03b1-helices or \u03b2-pleated sheets as well. This folding is held in place by various bonds between the R groups of nearby amino acids, including hydrogen, disulfide, and ionic bonds. Globular proteins, such as enzymes, are examples of tertiary structures. \n@@@Quaternary Structure\nSome proteins consist of more than one polypeptide chain, and the way these chains fit together in 3D is referred to as the quaternary structure. Examples of proteins with quaternary structure include important enzymes and the blood pigment, hemoglobin. \n@@@Effects of Changing Conditions\nChanges in temperature or pH can affect the bonds that hold the 3D shape of proteins together. Even small changes can cause these bonds to break and result in denaturation, where the protein loses its 3D shape. This can affect the function of important proteins, such as enzymes, in the body. \n@@@Fibrous and Globular Proteins\nProteins can be classified into two broad categories based on their structure and function: fibrous and globular proteins.\n@@@Fibrous Proteins\nFibrous proteins have little or no tertiary structure and are characterized by long, parallel polypeptide chains. These proteins are often insoluble in water and are known for their toughness, making them well-suited for structural functions in organisms. Examples of fibrous proteins include collagen in connective tissue, silk in spider webs and cocoons, and keratin in hair and nails. \n@@@Collagen\nCollagen is a fibrous protein that provides strength to tendons, ligaments, bones, and skin. It is the most common structural protein in animals and makes up about 35% of the protein in the human body. The unique structure of collagen, with its three polypeptide chains in a triple helix held together by hydrogen bonds, contributes to its exceptional strength. \n@@@Building Collagen Fibres\nCollagen molecules can form fibrils that are held together to make collagen fibres. These fibres can be several millimeters long and are built up from many collagen molecules. ","107":"\n@@@Collagen as the Basis of Bone Strength\n\nCollagen is a fibrous protein that is an essential component for the tensile strength of bones. It combines with bone tissue, similar to the way steel rods reinforce concrete. However, in genetic disease osteogenesis imperfecta, collagen is unable to develop properly, resulting in brittle bones that break easily.\n\n@@@The Assembly of Collagen\n\nAssembly of collagen occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen and after secretion from the cell. The precursor to collagen, procollagen, is made up of three chains that are assembled together. Once secreted, the procollagen molecules are cleaved by peptidases, revealing the triple helix structure of collagen, with loose ends. These collagen molecules then come together to form even larger structures, such as collagen fibres and fibrils.\n\n@@@The Uniqueness of Collagen's Structure\n\nCollagen is a fibrous protein with an unusual triple helix structure, making it incredibly strong. The collagen molecule is a precursor to the \u03b1-chain procollagen, with loose ends. It then forms into a triple helix structure, with a diameter of 67 nm. This unique structure is what gives collagen its immense strength.\n\n@@@The Role of R Groups in Globular Proteins\n\nGlobular proteins have complex tertiary and sometimes quaternary structures, forming spherical shapes. The specific R groups on amino acids play a crucial role in the formation of these proteins. Some R groups are hydrophobic, found on the inside of the protein, while others are hydrophilic, found on the outside. The large size of these molecules results in their unique behavior in water, forming colloids rather than true solutions.\n\n@@@The Importance of Globular Proteins\n\nGlobular proteins serve several important roles in the body. They hold molecules in place in the cytoplasm and are crucial for the immune system, as seen in antibodies. Enzymes and hormones are also examples of globular proteins. Haemoglobin, a well-known globular protein, plays a vital role in carrying oxygen to the body's tissues.\n\n@@@The Quaternary Structure of Haemoglobin\n\nHaemoglobin is a large molecule consisting of 574 amino acids arranged in four polypeptide chains. These chains are connected by disulfide bonds and each surround an iron-containing haem group, which is essential for binding and releasing oxygen molecules. The quaternary structure of haemoglobin, with its four haem groups, allows for efficient transportation of oxygen in the body.","108":"\n\n@@@Atherosclerosis\nOnce damage to the endothelium has occurred, the body\u2019s inflammatory response begins and \nwhite blood cells arrive at the site of  the damage. These cells accumulate chemicals from the blood, especially cholesterol. This leads to a plaque (also known as an atheroma) forming on the endothelial lining of  the artery (see fig C). Fibrous tissue and calcium salts also build up (increase in amount) around the atheroma, turning it into a hardened plaque. This hardened area means that part of  the artery wall is less elastic and narrower than it should be. This is known as atherosclerosis and is summarized in fig B.\n \n@@@Effects of Atherosclerosis on Health\nAtherosclerosis can have serious effects on an individual's health. The development of atherosclerosis can be summarized as: damage to the endothelium of the arteries \u2192 inflammatory response \u2192 accumulation of cholesterol \u2192 atheroma \u2192 fibrous tissue\/calcium salts \u2192 plaque \u2192 narrowing\/loss of elasticity of the artery.\n\n@@@Aneurysms\nIf an area of an artery is narrowed by plaque, blood tends to collect behind the blockage, which causes the artery to bulge and become weakened. This is known as an aneurysm. If the artery wall becomes too weak, it may split open and cause massive internal bleeding. Aneurysms are most common in the blood vessels supplying the brain or in the aorta. If diagnosed, an aneurysm can be treated with surgery before it bursts.\n\n@@@Raised Blood Pressure\nThe narrowing of arteries due to plaques on the walls can cause raised blood pressure. This can lead to severe damage to various organs including the kidneys, eyes, and brain. The high pressure can damage the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys, resulting in proteins being forced out through their walls and potentially causing kidney damage. Similarly, the tiny blood vessels in the retina of the eye can become damaged, leading to blindness. Bleeding from capillaries into the brain can also result in a stroke.\n\n@@@Heart Disease\nAtherosclerosis is closely linked to two common forms of heart disease: angina and myocardial infarction (heart attack). In angina, plaques build up in the coronary arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart muscle. This can result in symptoms such as chest pain, arm pain, jaw pain, and breathlessness during exercise. While regular exercise, weight loss, and not smoking can help alleviate symptoms, medication may also be necessary. If the blockage of the coronary arteries continues to worsen, symptoms may also worsen and require additional medication to dilate blood vessels and reduce heart rate. However, medication alone cannot treat atherosclerosis and invasive procedures may be necessary to remove blockages. ","109":"\n@@@Introduction\nThe circulatory system plays a crucial role in all vertebrates, including mammals. In order to study this system and the diseases that can arise from it, we will focus on the human body. One of the most common diseases affecting the circulatory system is atherosclerosis. This disease causes the narrowing of arteries, making it difficult for blood to flow properly. This can lead to numerous health issues, including strokes and heart attacks. In this section, we will explore the causes and effects of atherosclerosis, as well as potential solutions for these issues.\n\n@@@Atherosclerosis-Based Health Problems\nAtherosclerosis can cause two of the most severe problems in the human body: angina and myocardial infarction. Angina occurs when there is reduced blood flow to the cardiac muscle. On the other hand, myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack, occurs when one of the coronary arteries becomes completely blocked, resulting in permanent damage to a part of the heart muscle. These health problems are often caused by blood clots that form as a result of atherosclerosis.\n\n@@@Blood Clotting and its Consequences\nAs mentioned earlier, the stiffened walls of arteries affected by atherosclerosis make them prone to damage and the formation of blood clots. These blood clots can be triggered by platelets touching the damaged surface of a plaque. Moreover, the rupture of a plaque can release cholesterol, which can also cause blood clots. High blood pressure and smoking are also potential causes of damage to the endothelial lining, resulting in blood clot formation. Depending on the location of the blockage in the coronary artery, heart attacks can range from small to severe.\n\n@@@Heart Attacks\nThe severity of a heart attack depends on the position of the blockage in the coronary artery. The largest heart attack, also known as cardiac arrest, occurs when the blockage is at point C in the artery. This can be fatal. A medium heart attack, which causes death of some heart tissue, occurs at point B, and a small heart attack, causing death of a small amount of heart tissue, occurs at point A.\n\n@@@Symptoms and Importance of Prompt Action\nDuring a heart attack, chest pain similar to angina may occur, but it is much more severe and can last for hours. In some cases, death may occur suddenly with no prior symptoms, while in others, there may be a few days of fatigue and symptoms mistaken for indigestion before the heart attack. It is crucial to react quickly in case of a heart attack and take immediate action, such as administering aspirin, to prevent further damage and seek medical attention as soon as possible.\n\n@@@Strokes\nAnother severe health issue caused by atherosclerosis is strokes. A stroke occurs when there is an interruption in the normal blood supply to an area of the brain. This can be caused by bleeding from damaged capillaries or a blockage in the blood flow. Similar to heart attacks, a blockage in one of the main arteries leading to the brain can be fatal, while a blockage in smaller arterioles may have less disastrous effects.\n\n@@@Symptoms and Effects of Strokes\nThe symptoms of strokes vary depending on the extent of the damage to the brain. They can include dizziness, confusion, slurred speech, blurred vision, or partial loss of vision. In severe cases, paralysis may occur on one side of the body. The damage from strokes can happen quickly, making immediate action essential.\n\n@@@Conclusion\nAtherosclerosis is a serious disease that can cause various health problems, including angina, heart attacks, and strokes. It is important to understand the causes and effects of this disease to take necessary precautions and seek prompt medical attention in case of emergencies."}}
