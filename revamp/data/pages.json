It's basically the opposite of a condensation reaction.3) For example, carbohydrates can be broken down into their constituent monosaccharides by hydrolysis reactions.PolymerAHydrolysis \u2014 the bond is broken by theaddition of a water molecule-OH HO--OHEven hydrolysis couldn't break this bond.Use the Benedict\u2019s Test for SugarsSugar is a general term for monosaccharides and disaccharides. All sugars can be classified as reducing or non-reducing. The Benedict's test tests for sugars \u2014 it differs depending on the type of sugar you are testing for.1)2)3)Reducing sugars include all monosaccharides (e.g. glucose) and some disaccharides (e.g. maltose and lactose).You add Benedict's reagent (which is blue) to a sample and heat it in a water bath that's been brought to the boil.If the test's positive it will form a coloured precipitate (solid particles suspended in the solution).The colour of the precipitate changes from:blue-\u00a3> green>=>-yellowH>orange=4> brick redr Alwars us\u00ab an excess of r Z Benedict's solution \u2014 ;Z thls mak\u00ab sure that all ~ Z the sugar reacts. z1 1 1 \" I I I I I I M M | | | V\\N4)The higher the concentration of reducing sugar, the further the colour change goes \u2014 you can use this to compare the amount of reducing sugar in different solutions. A more accurate way of doing this is to filter the solution and weigh the precipitate.C\/1d\u00a3<UD1X1UZuDOLUIzO1) If the result of the reducing sugars test is negative, there could still be a non-reducing sugar present. To test for non-reducing sugars, like sucrose, first you have to break them down into monosaccharides.2) You do this by getting a new sample of the test solution, adding dilute hydrochloric acid and carefully heating it in a water bath that's been brought to the boil. You then neutralise it with sodium hydrogencarbonate. Then just carry out the Benedict's test as you would for a reducing sugar.3) If the test's positive it will form a coloured precipitate (as for the reducing sugars test). If the test's negative the solution will stay blue, which means it doesn't contain any sugar (either reducing or non-reducing).Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","2":"4CarbohydratesSo, you've already looked at monosaccharides and disaccharides... now it's time to give polysaccharides some love.Polysaccharides are Loads of Sugars Joined TogetherA polysaccharide is formed when more than two monosaccharides are joined together by condensation reactions.\na-glucose a-glucose a-glucose a-glucose a-glucoseYou need to know about the relationship between the structure and function of three polysaccharides\u2014 starch, glycogen and cellulose.Starch is the Main Energy Storage Material in Plants\none alpha-glucose molecule1) Cells get energy from glucose. Plants store excess glucose as starch (when a plant needs more glucose for energy, it breaks down starch to release the glucose).2) Starch is a mixture of two polysaccharides of alpha-glucose \u2014 amylose and amylopectin:\u2022 Amylose \u2014 a long, unbranched chain of a-glucose. The angles of the glycosidic bonds give it a coiled structure, almost like a cylinder. This makes it compact, so it's really good for storage because you can fit more in to a small space.\u2022 Amylopectin \u2014 a long, branched chain of a-glucose. Its side branches allow the enzymes that break down the molecule to get at the glycosidic bonds easily.This means that the glucose can be released quickly. Amylopectin3) Starch is insoluble in water and doesn't affect water potential (see page 40), so it doesn't cause water to enter cells by osmosis, which would make them swell.This makes it good for storage.Use the Iodine Test for StarchIf you do any experiment on the digestion of starch and want to find out if any is left, you'll need the iodine test.just add iodine dissolved in potassium iodide solution to the test sample. If there is starch present, the sample changes from browny-orange to a dark, blue-black colour.Glycogen is the Main Energy Storage Material in AnimalsGlycogen1) Animal cells get energy from glucose too.But animals store excess glucose as glycogen\u2014 another polysaccharide of alpha-glucose.2) Its structure is very similar to amylopectin, except that it has loads more side branches coming off it. Loads of branches means that stored glucose can be released quickly, which is important for energy release in animals.3) It's also a very compact molecule, so it's good for storage.After throwing and fetching the ball no less than 312 times, Chappy and Stuart were finally out of glycogen.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","3":"8ProteinsThere are loads of different proteins with loads of different functions. But what are proteins? What do they look like? Well, for your enjoyment, here are the answers to all those questions and many, many more...Proteins are Made from Long Chains of Amino Acids1) The monomers of proteins are amino acids.2) A dipeptide is formed when two amino acids join together.3) A polypeptide is formed when more than two amino acids join together.4) Proteins are made up of one or more polypeptides.Grant's cries of \"die peptide, die\" could be heard for miles around. He'd never forgiven it for sleeping with his wife.Different Amino Acids Have Different Variable GroupsAmino acids have the same general structure \u2014 a carboxyl group (-COOH), an amine or amino group (-NH2) and an R group (also known as a variable side group).Structure of an Amino AcidR ^\u2014variable groupIH,N \u2014 CCOOH\\groupcarboxylgroupAll living things share a bank of only 20 amino acids.The only difference between them is what makes up their R group.Polypeptides are Formed by Condensation ReactionsE.g.

They're much easier to explain if you describe their structure in four 'levels'. These levels are a protein's primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures.Primary Structure \u2014 this is the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain.Secondary Structure \u2014 the polypeptide chain doesn't remain flat and straight.Hydrogen bonds form between the amino acids in the chain.This makes it automatically coil into an alpha (a) helix or fold into a beta ((3) pleated sheet \u2014 this is the secondary structure.Tertiary Structure \u2014 the coiled or folded chain of amino acids is often coiled and folded further. More bonds form between different parts of the polypeptide chain, including hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds (attractions between negative and positive charges on different parts of the molecule).Disulfide bridges also form whenever two molecules of the amino acid cysteine come close together \u2014 the sulfur atom in one cysteine bonds to the sulfur atom in the other. For proteins made from a single polypeptide chain, the tertiary structure forms their final 3D structure.Quaternary Structure \u2014 some proteins are made of several different polypeptide chains held together by bonds. The quaternary structureis the way these polypeptide chains are assembled together. For proteins made from more than one polypeptide chain (e.g. haemoglobin, insulin, collagen), the quaternary structure is the protein's final 3D structure.amino acid\nTopic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","4":"9ProteinsProteins have a Variety of FunctionsThere are loads of different proteins found in living organisms. They've all got different structures and shapes, which makes them specialised to carry out particular jobs.

They're soluble and often have roles in metabolism, e.g. some enzymes break down large food molecules (digestive enzymes, see pages 66-67) and other enzymes help to synthesise (make) large molecules.< ] j >2) Antibodies \u2014 are involved in the immune response. They're made up of two light (short)polypeptide chains and two heavy (long) polypeptide chains bonded together.

So, whether you feel the need for some speed or not, read on \u2014 because you really need to know this basic stuff about enzymes.Enzymes are Biological CatalystsEnzymes speed up chemical reactions by acting as biological catalysts. A catalyst is a substance _1)2)3)4)5)6)- readior without being _r up in the reaction\"'t 11 n ' i\" 111\" 1Enzymes catalyse metabolic reactions \u2014 both at a cellular level (e.g. respiration) and for the organism as a whole (e.g. digestion in mammals).Enzymes can affect structures in an organism (e.g. enzymes are involved in the production of collagen, an important protein in the connective tissues of animals) as well as functions (like respiration).Enzyme action can be intracellular \u2014 within cells, or extracellular \u2014 outside cells.Enzymes are proteins (see previous page).Enzymes have an active site, which has a specific shape. The active site is the part of the enzyme where the substrate molecules (the substance that the enzyme interacts with) bind to.Enzymes are highly specific due to their tertiary structure (see next page).Enzymes Lower the Activation Energy of a ReactionIn a chemical reaction, a certain amount of energy needs to be supplied to the chemicals before the reaction will start. This is called the activation energy \u2014 it's often provided as heat. Enzymes lower the amount of activation energy that's needed, often making reactions happen at a lower temperature than they could without an enzyme. This speeds up the rate of reaction.When a substrate fits into the enzyme's active site it forms an enzyme-substrate complex \u2014 it's this that lowers the activation energy. Here are two reasons why:1) If two substrate molecules need to be joined, being attached to the enzyme holds them close together, reducing any repulsion between the molecules so they can bond more easily.2) If the enzyme is catalysing a breakdown reaction, fitting into the active site puts a strain on bonds in the substrate, so the substrate molecule breaks up more easily.chemical reaction beginsactivation ener^y_neede_d _ without enzymeenergy is released as the product is formedTime- chemical reaction without enzyme-chemicalreactionwithenzymeThe \u2018L o c k  and K e y \u2019 Model is a Good Start...Enzymes are a bit picky \u2014 they only work with substrates that fit their active site. Early scientists studying the action of enzymes came up with the lock and key' model. This is where the substrate fits into the enzyme in the same way that a key fits into a lock.enzyme is unchanged\ncomplexScientists soon realised that the lock and key model didn't give the full story. The enzyme and substrate do have to fit together in the first place, but new evidence showed that the enzyme-substrate complex changed shape slightly to complete the fit. This locks the substrate even more tightly to the enzyme. Scientists modified the old lock and key model and came up with the 'induced fit' model.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","6":"77Enzyme Action...but the Induced Fit\u2019 Model is a Better TheoryThe 'induced fit' model helps to explain why enzymes are so specific and only bond to one particular substrate.The substrate doesn't only have to be the right shape to fit the active site, it has to make the active site change shape in the right way as well. This is a prime example of how a widely accepted theory can change when new evidence comes along. The 'induced fit' model is still widely accepted \u2014 for now, anyway.\nenzymeas the substrate binds the active site changes shape slightly.productsXsubstrateenzyme-substratecomplexThe \u2018Luminous Tights\u2019 model was popular in the 1980s but has since been found to be grossly inappropriate.Enzyme Properties Relate to Their Tertiary Structure1) Enzymes are very specific \u2014 they usually only catalyse one reaction, e.g. maltase only breaks down maltose, sucrase only breaks down sucrose.2) This is because only one complementary substrate will fit into the active site.3) The active site's shape is determined by the enzyme's tertiary structure (which is determined by the enzyme's primary structure).4) Each different enzyme has a different tertiary structure and so a different shaped active site.If the substrate shape doesn't match the active site, an enzyme-substrate complex won't be formed and the reaction won't be catalysed.5) If the tertiary structure of the enzyme is altered in any way, the shape of the active site will change. This means the substrate won't fit into the active site, an enzyme-substrate complex won't be formed and the enzyme will no longer be able to carry out its function.6) The tertiary structure of an enzyme may be altered by changes in pH or temperature (see next page).7) The primary structure (amino acid sequence) of a protein is determined by a gene. If a mutation occurs in that gene (see p. 91), it could change the tertiary structure of the enzyme produced.Practice QuestionsQ1 What is an enzyme?Q2 What is the name given to the amount of energy needed to start a reaction?Q3 What is an enzyme-substrate complex?Q4 Why can an enzyme only bind to one substance?[4 marks] [2 marks]Exam QuestionsQ1 Dcscribc the \u2018induced fit\u2019 model of enzyme action.Q2 Explain how a change in the amino acid sequence of an enzyme may prevent it from functioning properly.But why is the enzyme-substrate complex?So enzymes lower the activation energy of a reaction. I like to think of it as an assault course (bear with me). Suppose the assault course starts with a massive wall \u2014 enzymes are like the person who gives you a leg up over the wall (see?). Without it you'd need lots of energy to get over the wall yourself and complete the rest of the course. Unlikely.Topic IA \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","7":"72Factors Affecting Enzyme ActivityNow you know what enzymes are and how they work, let's take a look at what makes them tick. Humans need things like money and the newest mobile phone, but enzymes are quite content with the right temperature and pH.Temperature has a Big Influence on Enzyme ActivityLike any chemical reaction, the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction increases when the temperature's increased. More heat means more kinetic energy, so molecules move faster. This makes the enzymes more likely to collide with the substrate molecules. The energy of these collisions also increases, which means each collision is more likely to result in a reaction. But, if the temperature gets too high, the reaction stops.1) The rise in temperature makes the enzyme's molecules vibrate more.2) If the temperature goes above a certain level, this vibration breaks some of the bonds that hold the enzyme in shape.3) The active site changes shape and the enzyme and substrate no longer fit together.4) At this point, the enzyme is denatured\u2014 it no longer functions as a catalyst.optimum temperature11 nn 11,TemperaturepH Also Affects Enzyme ActivityO\u2019\" \" I M I | | | ,, , ,~ Every enzyme has an enzyme is r optimum temperature = denatured r For most human enzymes - r ,t,saro^37\u00b0C but some r _ enzymes, like those used in ~- biological washing powders, ~ ~ can work well at 60 \u00b0C ~All enzymes have an optimum pH value. Most human enzymes work best at pH 7 (neutral), but there are exceptions. Pepsin, for example, works best at acidic pH 2, which is useful because it's found in the stomach. Above and below the optimum pH, the H+ and OH ions found in acids and alkalis can mess up the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds that hold the enzyme's tertiary structure in place. This makes the active site change shape, so the enzyme is denatured.Enzyme Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction1) The more enzyme molecules there are in a solution,the more likely a substrate molecule is to collide with one and form an enzyme-substrate complex. So increasing the concentration of the enzyme increases the rate of reaction.2) But, if the amount of substrate is limited, there comes a point when there's more than enough enzyme molecules to deal with all the available substrate, so adding more enzyme has no further effect.steady increase as more active sites are available \\if substrate amount is limited, an increase in enzyme concentration eventually has no further effectEnzyme ConcentrationSubstrate Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction Up to a Pointsteady increase as more substrate molecules are availableall active sites used \u2014 increase in substrate concentration has no further effectSubstrate Concentration1) The higher the substrate concentration, the faster the reaction \u2014 more substrate molecules means a collision between substrate and enzyme is more likely and so more active sites will be used. This is only true up until a 'saturation' point though. After that, there are so many substrate molecules that the enzymes have about as much as they can cope with(all the active sites are full), and adding more makes no difference.2) Substrate concentration decreases with time during a reaction (unless more substrate is added to the reaction mixture), so if no other variables are changed, the rate of reaction will decrease over time too. This makes the initial rate of reaction (the reaction rate at the start) the highest rate of reaction.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","8":"13Factors Affecting Enzyme ActivityEnzyme Activity can be InhibitedEnzyme activity can be prevented by enzyme inhibitors Inhibition can be competitive or non-competitive.COMPETITIVE INHIBITIONmolecules that bind to the enzyme that they inhibit.1) Competitive inhibitor molecules have a similar shape to that of the substrate molecules.2) They compete with the substrate molecules to bind to the active site, but no reaction takes place.3) Instead they block the active site, so no substrate molecules can fit in it. ienzymesubstrateinhibitor molecule fits into active site because it is a similar shape to the substrate moleculeenzyme-controlled reaction without an inhibitorsame reaction with a competitive inhibitor \u2014 rate increases as substrate concentration is increasedSubstrate Concentration4) How much the enzyme is inhibited depends on the relative concentrations of the inhibitor and the substrate.5) If there's a high concentration of the inhibitor, it'll take up nearly all the active sites and hardly any of the substrate wil get to the enzyme.6) But if there's a higher concentration of substrate, then the substrate's chances of getting to an active site before the inhibitor increase. So increasing the concentration of substrate will increase the rate of reaction (up to a point).NON-COMPETITIVE INHIBITION1) Non-competitive inhibitor molecules bind to the enzyme away from its active site.2) This causes the active site to change shape so the substrate molecules can no longer bind to it.3) They don't 'compete' with the substrate molecules to bind to the active site because they are a different shape.4) Increasing the concentration of substrate won't make any difference to the reaction rate \u2014 enzyme activity will still be inhibited.inhibitor molecule fits onto enzyme away from active siteenzymesubstrate molecule can no longer fit into active siteVXinhibitor causes changes that alter active sitensCZ.nsO'enzyme-controlled reaction without an inhibitorsame reaction with a non-competitive inhibitor \u2014 increasing the substrate conc. has little effect on rateiSubstrate ConcentrationPractice QuestionsQ1 Draw a graph to show the effect of temperature on enzyme activity.Q2 Draw a graph to show the effect of pH on enzyme activity.Q3 Explain the effect of increasing substrate concentration on the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction.Exam QuestionQ1 Inhibitors prevent enzymes from working properly.

It's easy to measure the volume of oxygen produced and to work out how fast it's given off. The diagram below shows the apparatus you'll need.

The diagram shows how the experiment can be set up. You'll need the apparatus shown in the diagram as well as a stopwatch. A drop of iodine in potassium iodide is put into each well on a spotting tile. A known concentration of amylase and starch are then mixed together in a test tube. A dropping pipette is used to put a drop of this mixture into one of the wells containing the iodine solution on the spotting tile at regular intervals and the resulting colour is observed. The iodine solution goes dark blue-black when starch is present but remains its normal browny-orange colour when there's no starch around. You can see how fast amylase is working by recording how long it takes for the iodine solution to no longer turn blue-black when starch\/amylase mixture is added. Repeat the experiment using different concentrations of amylase. Make sure that you also repeat the experiment three times at each amylase concentration.The experiments above show you how you can investigate the effects of temperature and enzyme concentration on the rate of enzyme-controlled reactions. You can also alter these experiments to investigate the effect of a different variable, such as pH (by adding a buffer solution with a different pH to each test tube) or substrate concentration (you could use serial dilutions to make substrate solutions with different concentrations).

You'll also need to label your drawing.High and low power objective lensesThe Mitotic Index Is the Proportion of Cells Undergoing MitosisYou can calculate the mitotic index of your cells using this formula:mitotic index =number of cells with visible chromosomes total number of cells observedThis lets you work out how quickly the tissue is growing and if there's anything weird going on. A plant root tip is constantly growing, so you'd expect a high mitotic index (i.e. lots of cells in mitosis). In other tissue samples, a high mitotic index could mean that tissue repair is taking place or that there is cancerous growth in the tissue.Topic 2 A \u2014 Cell Structure and Division\n","11":"35Cell Division \u2014 Investigating MitosisYou Can Use A Graticule and Micrometer to Calculate the Size of Cells...1) You need to be able to calculate the size of the cells you're looking at.That's where the eyepiece graticule and stage micrometer come in \u2014 they're a bit like rulers.2) An eyepiece graticule is fitted onto the eyepiece. It's like a transparent ruler with numbers, but no units.3) The stage micrometer is placed on the stage \u2014 it is a microscope slide with an accurate scale (it has units) and it's used to work out the value of the divisions on the eyepiece graticule at a particular magnification.4) This means that when you take the stage micrometer away and replace it with the slide containing your tissue sample, you'll be able to measure the size of the cells.

If an object could be seen with one preparation technique, but not another, it was more likely to be an artefact than an organelle.Practice QuestionsQ1 Why do you need to squash the tissue when preparing a slide of plant root tip cells?Exam QuestionQ1 A sample of cells was prepared to observe mitosis.

Well now it's time to delve a little deeper...Membranes Control What Passes Through ThemAll cells are surrounded by membranes. In eukaryotic cells,many of the organelles are surrounded by membranes too.1)2)Cell-surface membranes surround cells. They are a barrier between the cell and its environment, controlling which substances enter and leave the cell. They're partially permeable \u2014 they let some molecules through but not others. Substances can move across the cell-surface membrane by diffusion, osmosis or active transport (see pages 38-43).The membranes around organelles divide the cell into different compartments \u2014 they act as a barrier between the organelle and the cytoplasm. They are also partially permeable and control what substances enter and leave the organelle.Cell Membranes have a Fluid Mosaic\u2019 StructurePartially permeable membranes can be useful at sea.The basic structure of all cell membranes is pretty much the same. They're composed of lipids (mainly phospholipids \u2014 see page 7), proteins and carbohydrates (attached to proteins or lipids).1)2)3)4)5)In 1972, the fluid mosaic model was suggested to describe the arrangement of molecules in the membrane.

They bind to the cholesterolhydrophobic tails of the phospholipids, causing them to pack more closely together.This restricts the movement of the phospholipids, making the membrane less fluid and more rigid.Cholesterol helps to maintain the shape of animal cells (which don't have cell walls). This is particularly important for cells that aren't supported by other cells, e.g. red blood cells, which float free in the blood.Topic 2B \u2014 Cell Membranes\n","13":"37Cell Membrane StructureThe Permeability of the Cell Membrane can be Investigated in the LabThe permeability of cell membranes is affected by different conditions, e.g. temperature and solvent concentration. You can investigate how these things affect permeability by doing an experiment using beetroot. Beetroot cells contain a coloured pigment that leaks out \u2014 the higher the permeability of the membrane, the more pigment leaks out of the cell. Here's how you could investigate how temperature affects beetroot membrane permeability:1) Use a scalpel to carefully cut five equal sized pieces of beetroot. (Make sure you do your cutting on a cutting board.) Rinse the pieces to remove any pigment released during cutting.2) Add the five pieces to five different test tubes, each containing 5 cm3 of water.Use a measuring cylinder or pipette to measure the water.3) Place each test tube in a water bath at a different temperature, e.g. 10 \u00b0C, 20 \u00b0C, 30 40 \u00b0C, 50 \u00b0C, for the same length of time (measured using a stopwatch).4) Remove the pieces of beetroot from the tubes, leaving just the coloured liquid.5) Now you need to use a colorimeter \u2014 a machine that passes light through the liquid and measures how much of that light is absorbed.

The process is pretty similar to facilitated diffusion (see p. 38) \u2014 a molecule attaches to the carrier protein, the protein changes shape and this moves the molecule across the membrane, releasing it on the other side.There are two main differences between active transport and facilitated diffusion though:1) Active transport usually moves solutes from a low to a high concentration\u2014 in facilitated diffusion, they always move from a high to a low concentration.2) Active transport requires energy \u2014 facilitated diffusion does not.\u2022 ATP is a common source of energy in the cell.

Infectious diseases can be really nasty, but luckily there's an army of cells in the body that helps lo protect us \u2014 the immune system.Foreign Antigens Trigger an Immune ResponseAntigens are molecules (usually proteins) that can generate an immune response when clctected by the body.They arc usually found on the surface of cells and are used by the immune system to identify: pathogens (organisms that cause disease), abnormal body cells (e.g. cancerous or pathogen-infected cells, which have abnormal antigens on their surface), toxins and cells from other individuals of the same species (e.g. organ transplants).There are four main stages in the immune response:(T) Phagocytes Engulf PathogensA phagocyte (e.g. a macrophage) is a type of white blood cell that carries out phagocytosis (engulfment of pathogens). They're found in the blood and in tissues and are the first cells to respond to an immune system trigger inside the body. Here's how they work:1) A phagocyte recognises the foreign antigens on a pathogen.2) The cytoplasm of the phagocyte moves round the pathogen, engulfing it.3) The pathogen is now contained in a phagocytic vacuole (a bubble) in the cytoplasm of the phagocyte.4) A lysosome (an organelle that contain enzymes called lysozymes) fuses with the phagocytic vacuole. The lysozymes break down the pathogen.5) The phagocyte then presents the pathogen's antigens \u2014 it sticks the antigens on its surface to activate other immune system cells.nucleuscytoplasmlysosomeantigens on surface ofphagocyte engulfs the pathogenlysosome fuses with phagocytic vacuole(2) Phagocytes Activate T-cellsA T-cell {also called a T-lymphocyte) is another type of white blood cell. It has receptor proteins on its surface that bind to complementary antigens presented to it by phagocytes. This activates the T-cell. Different types of T-cells respond in different ways. For example, helper T-cells {TH cells) release chemical signals that activate and stimulate phagocytes and cytotoxic T-cells (Tc cells), which kill abnormal and foreign cells B-cells, which secrete antibodies (see below).Th cells also activate(3) T-cells Activate B-cells, Which Divide into Plasma CellsB-cells (also called B-lymphocytes) are also a type of white blood cell. They're covered with antibodies \u2014 proteins that bind antigens to form an antigen-antibody complex. Each B-cell has a different shaped antibody on its membrane, so different ones bind to different shaped antigens.1) When the antibody on the surface of a B-cell meets a complementary shaped antigen, it binds to it.2) This, together with substances released from helper T-cells, activates the B-cell. This process is called clonal selection.3) The activated B-cell divides into plasma cells.(V) Plasma Cells Make More Antibodies to a Specific AntigenPlasma cells are identical to the B-cell (they're clones). They secrete loads of antibodies specific to the antigen. These are called monoclonal antibodies. They bind to the antigens on the surface of the pathogen to form lots of antigen-antibody complexes,An antibody has two binding sites, so can bind to two pathogens at the same time. This means that pathogens become clumped together \u2014 this is called agglutination. Phagocytes then bind to the antibodies and phagocytose many pathogens at once. This process leads to the destruction of pathogens carrying this antigen in the body.variableregions(orange)constan regions (blue)heavychainAntibodies are proteins \u2014 they're made up of chains of amino acids.The specificity of an antibody depends on its variable regions, which form the antigen binding sites. Each antibody has a variable region with a unique tertiary structure {due to different amino acid sequences) that's complementary to one specific antigen. All antibodies have the same constant regions.Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","19":"46Immunity and VaccinesThe primary response gives us immunity against a disease, but only after you've become infected. If only there was a way to stimulate memory cell production without getting the disease... well, there is \u2014 vaccination.Vaccines can Protect Individuals and Populations Against Disease1) While your B-cells are busy dividing to build up their numbers to deal with a pathogen (i.e. the primary response \u2014 see previous page), you suffer from the disease. Vaccination can help avoid this.2) Vaccines contain antigens that cause your body to produce memory cells against a particular pathogen, without the pathogen causing disease. This means you become immune without getting any symptoms.3) Vaccines protect individuals that have them and, because they reduce the occurrence of the disease, those not vaccinated are also less likely to catch the disease (because there are fewer people to catch it from). This is called herd immunity.4) Vaccines always contain antigens \u2014 these may be free or attached to a dead or attenuated (weakened) pathogen.5) Vaccines may be injected or taken orally. The disadvantages of taking a vaccine orally are that it could be broken down by enzymes in the gut or the molecules of the vaccine may be too large to be absorbed into the blood.6) Sometimes booster vaccines are given later on (e.g. after several years) to make sure that memory cells are produced.Antigenic Variation Helps Some Pathogens Evade the Immune System1) Antigens on the surface of pathogens activate the primary response.2) When you're infected a second time with the same pathogen (which has the same antigens on its surface) they activate the secondary response and you don't get ill.3) However, some sneaky pathogens can change their surface antigens. This antigen variability is called antigenic variation. (Different antigens are formed due to changes in the genes of a pathogen.)4) This means that when you're infected for a second time, the memory cells produced from the first infection will not recognise the different antigens. So the immune system has to start from scratch and carry out a primary response against these new antigens.5) This primary response takes time to get rid of the infection, which is why you get ill again.6) Antigenic variation also makes it difficult to develop vaccines against some pathogens for the same reason. Examples of pathogens that show antigenic variation include HIV and the influenza virus.7) Here's how antigenic variation affects the production of vaccines to help prevent people catching influenza:1) The influenza (flu) vaccine changes every year. That's because the antigens on the surface of the influenza virus change regularly, forming new strains of the virus.2) Memory cells produced from vaccination with one strain of the flu will not recognise other strains with different antigens. The strains are immunologically distinct.3) Every year there are different strains of the influenza virus circulating in the population, so a different vaccine has to be made.4) New vaccines are developed and one is chosen every year that is the most effective against the recently circulating influenza viruses.5) Governments and health authorities then implement a programme of vaccination using the most suitable vaccine.1st infection\n2nd infectiondifferent antigensThe oral vaccine was proving hard to swallow.\nTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","20":"48Antibodies in MedicineAntibodies aren't only great for fighting off infection, they're also excellent tools for use in medical diagnosis and drug development. Let's all give three cheers for antibodies. Without them, we'd all probably be dead by now.Monoclonal Antibodies can be used to Target Specific Substances or Cells1) Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies produced from a single group of genetically identical B-cells(plasma cells). This means that they're all identical in structure.2) As you know, antibodies are very specific because their binding sites have a unique tertiary structure (see p.44) that only one particular antigen will fit into (one with a complementary shape).3) You can make monoclonal antibodies that bind to anything you want, e.g. a cell antigen or other substance, and they will only bind to (target) this molecule.EXAMPLE: Targeting drugs to a particular cell type \u2014 cancer cells1) Different cells in the body have different surface antigens.2) Cancer cells have antigens called tumour markers that are not found on normal body cells.3) Monoclonal antibodies can be made that will bind to the tumour markers.4) You can also attach anti-cancer drugs to the antibodies.5) When the antibodies come into contact with the canccr cells they will bind to the tumour markers.6) This means the drug will only accumulate in the body where there are cancer cells.7) So, the side effects of an antibody-based drug are lower than other drugs because they accumulate near specific cells.monoclonalantibodyantigen binding siteanti-cancer drugdrug attached to antibodyantibody binds to tumour markers on cancer cellcell-surface antigen\/\\----------------------------No0No------------------------------------------------------------\u2014L\nnormal body cell tumour marker cancer cellEXAMPLE: Targeting a particular substance for medical diagnosis \u2014 pregnancy testingPregnancy tests detect the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) that's found in the urine of pregnant women:1) The application area contains antibodies for hCG bound to a coloured bead (blue).2) When urine is applied to the application area any hCG will bind to the antibody on the beads, forming an antigen-antibody complex.3) The urine moves up the stick to the test strip, carrying any beads with it.4) The test strip contains antibodies to hCG that are stuck in place (immobilised).5) If there is hCG present the test strip turns blue because the immobilised antibody binds to any hCG \u2014 concentrating the hCG-antibody complex with the blue beads attached.If no hCG is present, the beads will pass through the test area without binding to anything, and so it won't go blue.coloured bead antibody \u00a9 ^ to hCGhCG\nappflow of liquidIimmobilised antibody to hCGication areatest stripTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","21":"52HIV and VirusesViruses aren't cells like bacteria. They're not even living things \u2014 they can only reproduce inside the cells of another organism (called the host). All viruses cause disease, and you need to know all about one particularly nasty blighter...HIV is the Virus That Causes AIDS1) HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that affects the immune system.It eventually leads to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).2) AIDS is a condition where the immune system deteriorates and eventually fails. This makes someone with AIDS more vulnerable to other infections, like pneumonia (see next page).3) HIV infects (and eventually kills) helperT-cells, which act as the host cells (see p. 28) for the virus. Remember, helper T-cells send chemical signals that activate phagocytes, cytotoxic T-cells and B-cells (see p. 44) so they're hugely important cells in the immune response. Without enough helper T-cells, the immune system is unable to mount an effective response to infections because other immune system cells don't behave how they should.4) People infected with HIV develop AIDS when the helper T-cell numbers in their body reach a critically low level.HIV has a Spherical StructureYou might get asked about the structure of HIV in your exam1) A core that contains the genetic material (RNA) and some proteins (including the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is needed for virus replication).2) An outer coating of protein called a capsid.3) An extra outer layer called an envelope. This is made of membrane stolen from the cell membrane of a previous host cell.4) Sticking out from the envelope are loads of copies of an attachment protein that help HIV attach to thehost helper T-cell.HIV Replicates Inside its Host\u2019s Helper T-CellsHIV (and all other viruses) can only reproduce inside the cells of the organism it has infected. HIV replicates inside the helper T-cells of the host. It doesn't have the equipment (such as enzymes and ribosomes) to replicate on its own, so it uses those of the host cell.Here's how HIV replicates:1) The attachment protein attaches to a receptor molecule on the cell membrane of the host helper T-cell.2) The capsid is released into the cell, where it uncoats and releases the genetic material (RNA) into the cell's cytoplasm.3) Inside the cell, reverse transcriptase is used to make a complementary strand of DNA from the viral RNA template (see p. 16-17 for more on DNA and RNA).4) From this, double-stranded DNA is made and inserted into the human DNA.5) Host cell enzymes are used to make viral proteins from theviral DNA found within the human DNA.6) The viral proteins are assembled into new viruses, which bud from the cell and go on to infect other cells.During the initial infection period, HIV replicates rapidly and the infected person may experience severe flu-likesymptoms. After this period, HIV replication drops to a lower level. This is the latency period. During the latency period (which can last for years), the infected person won't experience any symptoms.Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\u00a9HIVhelper T cellDNA\u00a9\u00aev \u201c \u201c  DAttachment protein CapsidS1 , \" \"........................u-n,,,,,._ ttachnient proteins can also -EnvelopeGeneticmaterialReverse transcriptase\n","22":"54Topic 3A \u2014 Exchange and Transport SystemsSize and Surface AreaExchanging things with the environment is pretty easy if you're a single-celled organism, but if you're multicellular it all gets a bit more complicated... and it's all down to this 'surface area to volume ratio' malarkey.Organisms Need to Exchange Substances with their EnvironmentEvery organism, whatever its size, needs to exchange things with its environment.Otherwise there'd be no such thing as poop scoops...1) Cells need to take in oxygen (for aerobic respiration) and nutrients.2) They also need to excrete waste products like carbon dioxide and urea.3) Most organisms need to stay at roughly the same temperature, Raj was g|ac| he'd exchangedSO heat needs to be exchanged too. his canoe for a bigger boat.How easy the exchange of substances is depends on the organism's surface area to volume ratio.Smaller Animals have Higher Surface Area : Volume RatiosA mouse has a bigger surface area relative to its volume than a hippo.

The diffusion rate is quick because of the small distances the substances have to travel (see p. 39).2) In multicellular animals, diffusion across the outer membrane is too slow, for two reasons:\u2022 Some cells are deep within the body \u2014 there's a big distance between them and the outside environment.\u2022 Larger animals have a low surface area to volume ratio \u2014 it's difficult to exchange enough substances to supply a large volume of animal through a relatively small outer surface.So rather than using straightforward diffusion to absorb and excrete substances, multicellular animals need specialised exchange organs (like lungs \u2014 see p. 58).They also need an efficient system to carry substances to and from their individual cells \u2014 this is mass transport.In mammals, 'mass transport' normally refers to the circulatory system (see p. 70), which uses blood to carry glucose and oxygen around the body. It also carries hormones, antibodies (p. 44) and waste like CO,.Mass transport in plants involves the transport of water and solutes in the xylem and phloem (see pages 78 and 80).Topic 3 A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","23":"56Gas ExchangeLots of organisms have developed adaptations to improve their rate of gas exchange. It's a tricky business if you're an insect or a plant though \u2014 you've got to exchange enough gas but avoid losing all your water and drying to a crisp...Gas Exchange Surfaces have Two Major AdaptationsMost gas exchange surfaces have two things in common:1) They have a large surface area.2) They're thin (often just one layer of epithelial cells)\u2014 this provides a short diffusion pathway across the gas exchange surfaceThe organism also maintains a steep concentration gradient of gases across the exchange surface.All these features increase the rate of diffusion \u2014see page 39.Single-celled Organisms Exchange Gases across their Body Surface1) Single-celled organisms absorb and release gases by diffusion through their outer surface.2) They have a relatively large surface area, a thin surface and a short diffusion pathway (oxygen can take part in biochemical reactions as soon as it diffuses into the cell)\u2014 so there's no need for a gas exchange system.Fish Use a Counter-Current System for Gas ExchangeThere's a lower concentration of oxygen in water than in air. So fish have special adaptations to get enough of it.1) Water, containing oxygen, enters the fish through its mouth and passes out through the gills.2) Each gill is made of lots of thin plates called gill filaments, which give a big surface area for exchange of gases.3) The gill filaments are covered in lots of tiny structures called artcry ___^ \/(plural = lamellae)lamellae, which increase the surface area even more.4) The lamellae have lots of blood capillaries and a thin surface layer of cells to speed up diffusion.artery (deoxygenated blood to gill)artery (oxygenated blood from the gill)lamella\nblood leaves lamella with high oxygen conc.Water flowing towards the lamella (relatively high oxygen conc.'blood enters lamella with low oxygen conc.Water flowing away from the lamella (relatively low oxygen conc.)gill filaments5) Blood flows through the lamellae in one direction and water flows over in the opposite direction.

This means that oxygen diffuses directly into the respiring cells \u2014 the insect's circulatory system doesn't transport Or5) Carbon dioxide from the cells moves down its own concentration gradient towards the spiracles to be released into the atmosphere.6) Insects use rhythmic abdominal movements to move air in and out of the spiraclesspiracletracheole lined with single layer of cells to minimise diffusion distanceOj diffuses into respiring cellsCO, diffuses into tracheal tubesTopic 3 A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","24":"58Gas Exchange in HumansIn humans, gas exchange takes place in the lungs. You need to know the structure of the lungs as well as how they're ventilated... take a deep breath...Lungs are Specialised Organs for Gas ExchangeHumans need to get oxygen into the blood (for respiration) and they need to get rid of carbon dioxide (made by respiring cells). This is where breathing (or ventilation as it's sometimes called) and the gas exchange system comes in.Human Gas Exchange Systemintercostal muscles bronchusbronchiole alveoli1) As you breathe in, air enters the trachea (windpipe).2) The trachea splits into two bronchi \u2014 one bronchus leading to each lung.3) Each bronchus then branches off into smaller tubes called bronchioles.4) The bronchioles end in small 'air sacs' called alveoli (this is where gases are exchanged \u2014 see next page).5) The ribcage, intercostal muscles and diaphragm all work together to move air in and out (see below).si 111 n 111 u i w 111 m i \\ \/111 u ii i u 111111111 11111 m i 11 w n 111111\/ ~ There are actually three layers of intercostal muscles.

This can make it more difficult to breathe and reduce the rate of gas exchange.Measures of Lung Function Can Help to Diagnose Lung DiseasesLung diseases affect both ventilation (breathing) and gas exchange in the lungs \u2014 in other words, how well the lungs function. Doctors can carry out tests to investigate lung function and diagnose a lung disease. You might be asked to interpret results from tests like these in your exams. Here are some terms you might come across:1) Tidal volume is the volume of air in each breath \u2014 usually between 0.4 dm* and 0.5 dm* for adults.2) Ventilation rate is the number of breaths per minute. For a healthy person at rest it's about 15 breaths.3) Forced expiratory volumet (FEV1) is the maximum volume of air that can be breathed out in 1 second.4) Forced vital capacity (FVC) is the maximum volume of air it is possible to sV\\n m u n m i m ibreathe forcefully out of the lungs after a really deep breath in. \u201c stan s \u00b0r. z0\/1 - decimetres cubed, -X 1 dm3 is the same -You can figure out tidal volume, ventilation rate and other measures of breathing from the graph produced from a spirometer (a fancy machine that scientists and doctors use to measure the volume of air breathed in and out):9. as a litre. :\nMeasuring tidal volume is one of the hardest jobs in the world.Different Diseases Affect the Lungs in Different WaysHere are some examples of different lung diseases and how they affect breathing.Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB)1) When someone becomes infected with tuberculosis bacteria, immune system cells build a wall around the bacteria in the lungs. This forms small, hard lumps known as tubercles.2) Infected tissue within the tubercles dies and the gaseous exchange surface is damaged, so tidal volume is decreased.3) Tuberculosis also causes fibrosis (see below), which further reduces the tidal volume.4) A reduced tidal volume means less air can be inhaled with each breath. In order to take in enough oxygen, patients have to breathe faster, i.e. ventilation rate is increased.5) Common symptoms include a persistent cough, coughing up blood and mucus, chest pains, shortness of breath and fatigue.Fibrosis1) Fibrosis is the formation of scar tissue in the lungs.This can be the result of an infection or exposure to substances like asbestos or dust.2) Scar tissue is thicker and less elastic than normal lung tissue.3) This means that the lungs are less able to expand and so can't hold as much air as normal \u2014 tidal volume is reduced, and so is FVC (i.e. a smaller volume of air can be forcefully breathed out).4) There's a reduction in the rate of gaseous exchange \u2014 diffusion is slower across a thicker scarred membrane.5) Symptoms of fibrosis include shortness of breath, a dry cough, chest pain, fatigue and weakness.6) Fibrosis sufferers have a faster ventilation rate than normal \u2014 to get enough air into their lungs to oxygenate their blood.Topic 3A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","26":"64Dissecting Gas Exchange SystemsAfter learning all about how different organisms are adapted for efficient gas exchange, you might be wondering what those structures really look like.

They'll probably be sheep or pig lungs from a butcher's shop. You should be able to see the trachea and two bronchi going into the lungs.To see the lungs inflate, attach a piece of rubber tubing to the trachea and pump air into the lungs using a foot or bicycle pump. The lungs will deflate by themselves because of the elastin in the walls of the alveoli (see p. 61).Never blow down the tube to inflate the lungs \u2014 you could end up sucking up stale air from irside the lungs into your mouth.Pop the lungs in a clear plastic bag before you start to stop bacteria inside the lungs from being released into the room.Once you've seen the lungs inflate, you can examine the different tissue types in the lungs.The trachea is supported by C-shaped rings of cartilage. smooth muscleA cross-section of the trachea looks like this:C-shapedcartilageII I | I 1 \\ I I I M I III I I ' I M 1\/- If you do cut the - Z. cartilage be careful \u2014 you -- need to wear goggles to rprotect your eyes.\/| i \\ i H n 111 w M 111 M i7)8) 9)Cartilage is tough, so if you want to open up the trachea, it's best to cut it lengthways, down the gap in the C-shaped rings.

You should be able to see the bronchioles branching off.Cut off a piece of the lung. The tissue will feel spongy because of the air trapped in all the alveoli.Lungs from a butcher are safe for humans to handle, but they could still contain bacteria that cause food poisoning. That's why it's important to wash your hands after the dissection and disinfect work surfaces.Here\u2019s How to Dissect Fish Gills in Bony Fish1) Again, make sure you're wearing an apron or lab coat.2) Place your chosen fish (something like a perch or salmon works well) in a dissection tray or on a cutting board.3) Gills are located on either side of the fish's head. They're protected on eachside by a bony flap called an operculum and supported by gill arches.4) To remove the gills, push back the operculum and use scissors to carefully remove the gills.

As you might imagine, this involves loads of different chemical reactions and our old friends, enzymes.Food is Broken Down into Smaller Molecules During Digestion1) The large biological molecules (e.g. starch, proteins) in food are too big to cross cell membranes.This means they can't be absorbed from the gut into the blood.2) During digestion, these large molecules are broken down into smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, amino acids), which can move across cell membranes. This means they can be easily absorbed from the gut into the blood, to be transported around the body for use by the body cells.3) You might remember from Topic 1 A, that most large biological molecules are polymers, which can be broken down into smaller molecules (monomers) using hydrolysis reactions.Hydrolysis reactions break bonds by adding water.4) During hydrolysis, carbohydrates are broken down into disaccharides and then monosaccharides.Fats are broken down into fatty acids and monoglycerides. Proteins are broken down into amino acids.Digestive Enzymes are Used to Break Down Biological Molecules in Food1) A variety of different digestive enzymes are produced by specialised cells in the digestive systems of mammals. These enzymes are then released into the gut to mix with food.2) Since enzymes only work with specific substrates (see page 11), different enzymes are needed to catalyse the breakdown of different food molecules.Carbohydrates are Broken Down by Amylase and Membrane-Bound Disaccharidases1) Amylase is a digestive enzyme that catalyses the conversion of starch (a polysaccharide) into the smaller sugar maltose (a disaccharide). This involves the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds in starch.2) Amylase is produced by the salivary glands (which release amylase into the mouth) and also by the pancreas (which releases amylase into the small intestine).3) Membrane-bound disaccharidases are enzymes that are attached to the cell membranes of epithelial cellslining the ileum (the final part of the small intestine). They help to break down disaccharides (e.g. maltose, sucrose and lactose) into monosaccharides (e.g. glucose, fructose and galactose).

As well as being found in all vertebrates, haemoglobin is found in earthworms, starfish, some insects, some plants and even in some bacteria.Haemoglobin Saturation Depends on the Partial Pressure of Oxygen1) The partial pressure of oxygen (p02) is a measure of oxygen concentration.The greater the concentration of dissolved oxygen in cells, the higher the partial pressure.2) Similarly, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pC02) is a measure of the concentration of CO, in a cell.3) Haemoglobin's affinity for oxygen varies depending on the partial pressure of oxygen:Oxygen loads onto haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin where there's a hi;Oxyhaemoglobin unloads its oxygen where there's a lower p02.4) Oxygen enters blood capillaries at the alveoli in the lungs.

Most multicellular organisms (mammals, insects, fish) have a circulatory system of some type.The Circulatory System is a Mass Transport System1) Multicellular organisms, like mammals, have a low surface area to volume ratio (see p. 54), so they need a specialised transport system to carry raw materials from specialised exchange organs to their body cells \u2014 this is the circulatory system.2) The circulatory system is made up of the heart and blood vessels.3) The heart pumps blood through blood vessels (arteries,arterioles, veins and capillaries) to reach different parts of the body.

Veins contain valves to stop the blood flowing backwards. Blood flow through the veins is helped by contraction of the body muscles surrounding them.

The right side only needs to get blood to the lungs, which are nearby.2) The ventricles have thicker walls than the atria, because they have to push blood out of the heart whereas the atria just need to push blood a short distance into the ventricles.3) The atrioventricular (AV) valves link the atria to the ventricles and stop blood flowing back into the atria when the ventricles contract.4) The semi-lunar (SL) valves link the ventricles to the pulmonary artery and aorta, and stop blood flowing back into the heart after the ventricles contract.5) The cords attach the atrioventricular valves to the ventricles to stop them being forced up into the atria when the ventricles contract.Captain Jeff reckoned the lock gates were just like a big heart valve \u2014 with enough pressure he would be able to force his way through.The valves only open one way \u2014 whether they're open or closed depends on the relative pressure of the heart chambers.If there's higher pressure behind a valve, it's forced open, but if pressure is higher in front of the valve it's forced shut.

There are certain factors that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.Most Cardiovascular Disease Starts with Atheroma Formationelastic tissue in wall1) The wall of an artery is made up of several layers (see p. 70).2) The endothelium (inner lining) is usually smooth and unbroken.3) If damage occurs to the endothelium (e.g. by high blood pressure) white blood cells (mostly macrophages) and lipids (fat) from the blood, clump together under the lining to form fatty streaks.4) Over time, more white blood cells, lipids and connective tissue build up and harden to form a fibrous plaque called an atheroma.5) This plaque partially blocks the lumen of the artery and restricts blood flow, which causes blood pressure to increase.6) Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a type of cardiovascular disease.It occurs when the coronary arteries have lots of atheromas in them, which restricts blood flow to the heart muscle. It can lead to myocardial infarction (see below).Atheromas Increase the Risk of Aneurysm and ThrombosisTwo types of disease that affect the arteries are:Aneurysm \u2014 a balloon-like swelling of the artery.1) Atheroma plaques damage and weaken arteries.They also narrow arteries, increasing blood pressure.2) When blood travels through a weakened artery at high pressure, it may push the inner layers of the artery through the outer elastic layer to form a balloon-like swelling \u2014 an aneurysm.3) This aneurysm may burst, causing a haemorrhage (bleeding).Thrombosis \u2014 formation of a blood clot.1) An atheroma plaque can rupture (burst through) the endothelium (inner lining) of an artery.2) This damages the artery wall and leaves a rough surface.3) Platelets and fibrin (a protein) accumulate at the site of damage and form a blood clot (a thrombus).4) This blood clot can cause a complete blockage of the artery, or it can become dislodged and block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body.5) Debris from the rupture can cause another blood clot to form further down the artery.Interrupted Blood Flow to the Heart can Cause a Myocardial Infarction1) The heart muscle is supplied with blood by the coronary arteries.2) This blood contains the oxygen needed by heart muscle cells to carry out respiration.3) If a coronary artery becomes completely blocked (e.g. by a blood clot) an area of the heart muscle will be totally cut off from its blood supply, receiving no oxygen.4) This causes a myocardial infarction \u2014 more commonly known as a heart attack.5) A heart attack can cause damage and death of the heart muscle.6) Symptoms include pain in the chest and upper body, shortness of breath and sweating.7) If large areas of the heart are affected complete heart failure can occur, which is often fatal.aneurysmnormal arterythick muscle* layerdeposits of fatty material, dead cells, white blood cells and connective tissuedeposits of fatty material etc. build up and push out endothelium to form an atheromalumen(space in centre)endothelium\nlumen shrinks as artery wall swells, so it's more difficult for blood to pass through\nTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n","33":"76Cardiovascular DiseaseSome Factors Increase the Risk of Cardiovascular DiseaseSome of the most common risk factors for cardiovascular disease are:High blood cholesterol and poor diet1) If the blood cholesterol level is high (above 240 mg per 100 cm3) then the risk of cardiovascular disease is increased.2) This is because cholesterol is one of the main constituents of the fatty deposits that form atheromas (see previous page).3) Atheromas can lead to increased blood pressure and blood clots.4) This could block the flow of blood to coronary arteries, which could cause a myocardial infarction (see previous page for details).5) A diet high in saturated fat is associated with high blood cholesterol levels.6) A diet high in salt also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease because it increases the risk of high blood pressure (see below).John decided to live on the edge and ordered a fry-up.G)Cigarette smoking1) Both nicotine and carbon monoxide, found in cigarette smoke, increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.2) Nicotine increases the risk of high blood pressure (see below).3) Carbon monoxide combines with haemoglobin and reduces the amount of oxygen transported in the blood, and so reduces the amount of oxygen available to tissues. If heart muscle doesn't receive enough oxygen it can lead to a heart attack(see previous page).4) Smoking also decreases the amount of antioxidants in the blood \u2014 these are important for protecting cells from damage. Fewer antioxidants means cell damage in the coronary artery walls is more likely, and this can lead to atheroma formation.High blood pressure1) High blood pressure increases the risk of damage to the artery walls.2) Damaged walls have an increased risk of atheroma formation, causing a further increase in blood pressure.3) Atheromas can also cause blood clots to form (see previous page).4) A blood clot could block flow of blood to the heart muscle, possibly resulting in myocardial infarction.5) So anything that increases blood pressure also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, e.g. being overweight, not exercising and excessive alcohol consumption.~ ^ther factors include age ' - (risk increases with age) ~ 5 and sex (men are more at E -v risk than women) - IW||VV\"Most of these factors are within our control \u2014 a person can choose to smoke, eat fatty foods, etc. However, some risk factors can't be controlled, such as having a genetic predisposition to coronary heart disease or having high blood pressure as a result of another condition, e.g. some forms of diabetes. Even so, the risk of developing cardiovascular disease can be reduced by removing as many risk factors as you possibly can.Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n","34":"78Transport in Plants \u2014 XylemTransport in plants isn't really roads and railways, but I guess it's a bit like a flowing river that's carrying stuff around in a network of tubes. When you consider the movement of water, it's all about the xylem. It's pretty exciting stuff...Two Types of Tissue are Involved in Transport in Plants1) Xylem tissue transports water and mineral ions in solution.These substances move up the plant from the roots to the leaves.2) Phloem tissue transports organic substances like sugars (also in solution) bothup and down the plant \u2014 there's more about the phloem on pages 80-81.3) Xylem and phloem are mass transport systems (see page 54) \u2014 they move substances over large distances.Xylem vessels are the part of the xylem tissue that actually transports the water and ions. Xylem vessels are very long, tube-like structures formed from dead cells (vessel elements) joined end to end.

This is because the stomata open when it gets light to let in CO, for photosynthesis. When it's dark the stomata are usually closed, so there's little transpiration.2) Temperature \u2014 the higher the temperature the faster the transpiration rate. Warmer water molecules have more energy so they evaporate from the cells inside the leaf faster. This increases the concentration gradient between the inside and outside of the leaf, making water diffuse out of the leaf faster.3) Humidity \u2014 the lower the humidity, the faster the transpiration rate (i.e. there's a negative correlationbetween humidity and transpiration rate). If the air around the plant is dry, the concentration gradient between the leaf and the air is increased, which increases transpiration.4) Wind \u2014 the windier it is, the faster the transpiration rate.

I know,; I almost can't contain my excitement. When it comes to the phloem it's all about moving dissolved organic substances around the plant, so it's a bit different to xylem.Phloem Tissue is Adapted for Transporting Solutes1) Solutes are dissolved substances. Phloem tissue transports solutes (mainly sugars like sucrose) round plants. Like xylem, phloem is formed from cells arranged in tubes.2) Sieve tube elements and companion cells are important cell types in phloem tissue:\u2022 Sieve tube elements are living cells that form the tube for transporting solutes. They have no nucleus and few organelles, so...\u2022 ...there's a companion cell for each sieve tube element. They carry out living functions for sieve cells, e.g. providing the energy needed for the active transport of solutes.Translocation is the Movement of Solutes1) Translocation is the movement of solutes (e.g. sugars like sucrose, and amino acids) to where they're needed in a plant. Solutes are sometimes called assimilates.2) It's an energy-requiring process that happens in the phloem.3) Translocation moves solutes from 'sources' to 'sinks'. The source of a solute is where it's made (so it's at a high concentration there). The sink is the area where it's used up (so it's at a lower concentration there).E.g. the source for sucrose is usually the leaves (where it's made), and the sinks are the other parts of the plant, especially the food storage organs and the meristems {areas of growth) in the roots, stems and leaves.4) Enzymes maintain a concentration gradient from the source to the sink by changing the solutes at the sink (e.g. by breaking them down or making them into something else). This makes sure there's always a lower concentration at the sink than at the source.E.g. in potatoes, sucrose is converted to starch in the sink areas, so there's always a lower concentration of sucrose at the sink than inside the phloem. This makes sure a constant supply of new sucrose reaches the sink from the phloem.The Mass Flow Hypothesis Best Explains Phloem TransportScientists still aren't certain exactly how the solutes are transported from source to sink by translocation. The best supported theory is the mass flow hypothesis:1) Active transport (see p. 42) is used to actively load the solutes (e.g. sucrose from photosynthesis) from companion cells into the sieve tubes of the phloem at the source (e.g. the leaves).2) This lowers the water potential inside the sieve tubes, so water enters the tubes by osmosis from the xylem and companion cells.3) This creates a high pressure inside the sieve tubes at the source end of the phloem.1) At the sink end, solutes are removed from the phloem to be used up.2) This increases the water potential inside the sieve tubes, so water also leaves the tubes by osmosis.3) This lowers the pressure inside the sieve tubes.(j) SOURCElow water potential, high pressurewater flow solute flow\u00a9sieve plate plasmodesma\u2014Water flows to xylem(2) SINK high water potential,\u00ae1) The result is a pressure gradient from the source end to the sink end.

They join together at fertilisation to form a zygote, which divides and develops into a new organism.2) Normal body cells have the diploid number (2n) of chromosomes \u2014 meaning each cell contains two of each chromosome, one from the mum and one from the dad.3) Gametes have a haploid (n) number of chromosomes \u2014 there's only one copy of each chromosome.4) At fertilisation, a haploid sperm fuses with a haploid egg, making a cell with the normal diploid number of chromosomes. Half these chromosomes are from the father (the sperm) and half are from the mother (the egg).5) During sexual reproduction, any sperm can fertilise any egg \u0000 produces zygotes with different combinations of chromosomes to both parents. This mixing of genetic materialin sexual reproduction increases genetic diversity within a species (there's more on genetic diversity on page 92).2 nfertilisation is random. Random fertilisationGametes are Formed by MeiosisMeiosis is a type of cell division. It takes place in the reproductive organs. Cells that divide by meiosis are diploid to start with, but the cells that are formed from meiosis are haploid \u2014 the chromosome number halves. Without meiosis, you'd get double the number of chromosomes when the gametes fused. Not good.1) Before meiosis starts, the DNA unravels and replicates so there are two copies of each chromosome, called chromatids.2) The DNA condenses to form double-armed chromosomes, each made from two sister chromatids. The sister chromatids are joined in the middle by a centromere.3) Meiosis I (first division) \u2014 the chromosomes arrange themselves into homologous pairs4) These homologous pairs are then separated, halving the chromosome number.5) Meiosis II (second division) \u2014 the pairs of sister chromatids that make up each chromosome are separated (the centromere is divided).6) Four haploid cells (gametes) that are genetically different from each other are producedIn the exams, you might need to spot when meiosis happens in an organism with a life cycle you haven't seen before, e.g. an insect or plant. Just remember (hat in any organism, meiosis is needed for sexual reproduction because it produces daughter cells (gametes) with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell.You might also be told how many chromosomes are in a parent cell, then asked to complete diagrams showing how many chromosomes will be in the daughter cells after the first and second divisions of meiosis. Remember that the chromosome number is halved during the first division.A Note About Homologous Pairs: Humans have 46 chromosomes in total \u2014 23 pairs. One chromosome in each pair came from mum and one from dad, e.g. there are two number 1's (one from mum and one from dad), two number 2s etc. The chromosomes that make up each pair are the same size and have the same genes. although they could have different versions of those genes (called alleles).

Mitosis and meiosis have different outcomes:Outcomes:MitosisProduces cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell.Daughter cells are genetically identical to each other and to the parent cell.Produces two daughter cells.MeiosisProduces cells with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.Daughter cells are genetically different from one another and the parent cell.Produces four daughter cells.You need to be able to explain the different outcomes of mitosis and meiosis. They're different because mitosis only involves one division (which separates the sister chromatids) whereas meiosis has two divisions (which separate the homologous pairs and then the sister chromatids). There's no pairing or separating of homologous chromosomes in mitosis, and so no crossing over or independent segregation of chromosomes. This produces genetically identical daughter cells \u2014 unlike meiosis.Topic 4B \u2014 Diversity, Classification and Variation\n","41":"92Genetic Diversity and Natural SelectionGenetic diversity describes the number of alleles in a species or population, and natural selection acts to increase the proportion of advantageous alleles.

This new population has very little genetic diversity compared to the southern elephant seals who never suffered such a reduction in numbers.Original population Coloured circles represent different allelesI Large number of I population dieReduced population ^ ReproductionNew population with reduced genetic diversityThe Founder Effect is a Type of Genetic Bottleneck1) The founder effect describes what happens when just a few organisms from a population start a new colony and there are only a small number of different alleles in the initial gene pool.2) The frequency of each allele in the new colony might be very different to the frequency of those alleles inthe original population \u2014 for example, an allele that was rare in the original population might be more common in the new colony. This may lead to a higher incidence of genetic disease.3) The founder effect can occur as a result of migration leading to geographical separation or if a newcolony is separated from the original population for another reason, such as religion.Example \u2014The AmishThe Amish population of North America are all descended from a small number of Swiss who migrated there. The population shows little genetic diversity. They have remained isolated from the surrounding population due to their religious beliefs, so few new alleles have been introduced.

Natural selection affects different populations in different ways, as you'll soon discover...Different Types of Natural Selection Lead to Different Frequency PatternsYou might remember from the previous page that natural selection alters allele frequency in a population. Stabilising selection and directional selection are types of natural selection that affect allele frequencyin different ways. You need to learn these examples:Antibiotic Resistance Shows Directional SelectionDirectional selection is where individuals with alleles for characteristics of an extreme type are more likely to survive and reproduce. This could be in response to an environmental change. Bacteria evolving antibiotic resistance is an example of directional selection. Here's how it works:1) Some individuals in a population have alleles that give them resistance to an antibiotic.2) The population is exposed to the antibiotic, killing bacteria without the resistant allele.3) The resistant bacteria survive and reproduce without competition, passing on the allele that gives antibiotic resistance to their offspring.4) After some time, most organisms in the population will carry the antibiotic resistance allele.PARENTSik totali iton$3T5population \/\"rrs\\ breeding ^\u0000>_CA-^population ^o\/ \\ l=^> t<y_Ci1 \\ \/ \\\u00a3c\/ \\ \u00a3 \\ 3 \\ C---------^ . \u0000OFFSPRING\nlowantibiotic resistancehighantibiotic resistanceHuman Birth Weight Shows Stabilising SelectionStabilising selection is where individuals with alleles for characteristics towards the middle of the range are more likely to survive and reproduce. It occurs when the environment isn't changing, and it reduces the range of possible characteristics. An example of stabilising selection is human birth weight.1) Humans have a range of birth weights.2) Very small babies are less likely to survive \u2014 partly because they find it hard to maintain their body temperature.3) Giving birth to large babies can be difficult, so large babies are less likely to survive too.4) Conditions are most favourable for medium-sized babies \u2014 so weight of human babies tends to shift towards the middle of the range.PARENTStotal populationbreedingpopulationOFFSPRING\nweight of babylight--!\"\u0000weight of baby hcav7You Need to be Able to Interpret Data on the Effects of SelectionYou might be asked to interpret information about an unfamiliar species in the exam.

Orangutans were the first group to diverge (evolve to become a different species) from this common ancestor.Each of the following branch points represents another common ancestor from which a different group diverged. Gorillas diverged next, then humans, closely followed by bonobos and chimpanzees.Closely related species diverged away from each other most recently. E.g. humans and chimpanzees are closely related, as they diverged very recently. You can see this because their branches are close together.\u0000 Gorilla\nClassification is All About Grouping Together Related OrganismsTaxonomy is the science of classification. It involves naming organisms and organising them into groups.This makes it easier to identify and study them. Scientists now take into account phylogeny when classifying organisms, and group organisms according to their evolutionary relationships.1) There are eight levels of groups used to classify organisms.These groups are called taxa. Each group is called a taxon.2) The groups are arranged in a hierarchy, with the largest groups at the top and the smallest groups at the bottom.Organisms can only belong to one group at each level in the hierarchy \u2014 there's no overlap.3) Organisms are first sorted into three large groups (or taxa) called domains \u2014 the Eukarya, Bacteria and Archaea.4) Related organisms in a domain are then sorted into slightly smaller groups called kingdoms, e.g. all animalsare in the animal kingdom. More closely related organisms from that kingdom are then groupedinto a phylum, then grouped into a class, and so on down the eight levels of the hierarchy.DomainKingdomPhylumClassOrderFamilyGenusSpecies- You need to learn -\"ames andorder of the groups -5)6)As you move down the hierarchy, there are more groups at each level but fewer organisms in each group. The organisms in each group also become more closely related.The hierarchy ends with species \u2014 the groups that contain only one type of organism (e.g. humans, dogs, E. coll). You need to learn the definition of a species:A species is a group of similar organisms able to reproduce to give fertile offspring.7) Scientists constantly update classification systems because of discoveries about new species and new evidence about known organisms (e.g. DNA sequence data \u2014 see page 98).Topic 4B \u2014 Diversity, Classification and Variation\n","44":"98DNA Technology, Classification and DiversityAdvances in DNA and molecular technology have led to advances in many other fields.For example, scientists have been able to use the technology to help classify organisms more accurately...Advances in Techniques Can Clarify Evolutionary RelationshipsNew or improved technologies can result in new discoveries being made and the relationships between organisms being clarified. This can lead to classification systems being updated. Technologies that have been useful for clarifying evolutionary relationships include:Genome sequencing \u2014 Advances in genome sequencing have meant that the entire base sequence of an organism's DNA can be determined. The DNA base sequence of one organism can then be compared to the DNA base sequence of another organism, to see how closely related they are. Closely related species will have a higher percentage of similarity in their DNA base order, e.g. humans and chimps share around 94%, humans and mice share about 86%.Genome sequencing has clarified the relationship between skunks and members of the Mustelidae family (e.g. weasels and badgers). Skunks were classified in the Mustelidae family until their DNA sequence was revealed to be significantly different to other members of that family. So they were reclassified into the family Mephitidae.Comparing amino acid sequence \u2014 Proteins are made of amino acids. The sequence of amino acids in a protein is coded for by the base sequence in DNA (see p. 82). Related organisms have similar DNA sequences and so similar amino acid sequences in their proteins. E.g. cytochrome C is a short protein found in many species. The more similar the amino acid sequence of cytochrome C in two different species, the more closely related the species are likely to be.Immunological comparisons \u2014 Similar proteinswill also bind the same antibodies (see p. 44).

Some habitats will be more biodiverse than others.2) Global biodiversity \u2014 you could also consider the variety of species on fcarlh. Recent estimates put the total number of species on tarth at about 8.7 million. Biodiversity varies in different parts of the world \u2014 it is greatest at the equator and decreases towards the poles.Pete wasn't sure that the company's new increased biodiversity policy would be good for productivity.Biodiversity Can be Measured Using an Index of Diversity1) Species richness is a measure of the number of different species in a community. It can be worked out by taking random samples of a community (see page 100) and counting the number of different species.2) Species richness is also a simple measure of biodiversity. But the number of different species in a communityisn't the only thing that affects biodiversity. The population sizes of those species do too. Species that are in acommunity in very small numbers shouldn't be treated the same as those with bigger populations.3) An index of diversity is another way of measuring biodiversity. It's calculated using an equation that takes both the number of species in a community (species richness) and the abundance of each species (population sizes) into account.4) You can calculate an index of diversity (d) using this formula:dN(N - 1) X n(n -  1)Where...N = Total number of organisms of all species n = Total number of organisms of one species X = 'Sum of' (i.e. added together)111 *11111 I I I I I I I \/ I I I I,Z.

Here's a quick recap:AdenineATPPhosphate groupsPhosphate bond1) A cell can't get its energy directly from glucose.2) So, in respiration, the energy released from glucose is used to make ATP (adenosine triphosphate).ATP carries energy around the cell to where it's needed.3) ATP is synthesised via a condensation reaction between ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (P.) using energy from an energy-releasing reaction, e.g. the breakdown of glucose in respiration. The energy is stored as chemical energy in the phosphate bond. The enzyme ATP synthase catalyses this reaction.4) ATP diffuses to the part of the cell that needs energy.5) Here, it's hydrolysed back into ADP and inorganic phosphate (P;). Chemical energy is releasedfrom the phosphate bond and used by the cell. ATP hydrolase catalyses this reaction.6) The ADP and inorganic phosphate are recycled and the process starts again.Topic 5 A \u2014 Photosynthesis and Respiration\n","47":"144Muscle ContractionMyofilaments sliding over one another takes a lot of energy \u2014 probably why exercise is such hard work...Myosin Filaments Have Globular Heads and Binding Sitestropomyosinactinfilament1) Myosin filaments have globular heads that are hinged, so they can move back and forth.2) Each myosin head has a binding site for actin and a binding site for ATP.3) Actin filaments have binding sites for myosin heads, called actin-myosin binding sites.4) Another protein called tropomyosin is found between actin filaments.It helps myofilaments move past each other.Binding Sites in Resting Muscles are Blocked by Tropomyosin1) In a resting (unstimulated) muscle the actin-myosin binding site is blocked by tropomyosin.2) So myofilaments can't slide past each other because the myosin heads can't bind to the actin-myosin binding site on the actin filaments.myosinglobularhead\ntropomyosin blocks the\" binding siteMuscle Contraction is Triggered by an Influx of Calcium IonsD2)When an action potential from a motor neurone stimulates a muscle cell, it depolarises the sarcolemma.

A new actin-myosin cross bridge is formed and the cycle is repeated (attach, move, detach, reattach to new binding site...)10) Many cross bridges form and break very rapidly, pulling the actin filament along \u2014 which shortens the sarcomere, causing the muscle to contract11) The cycle will continue as long as calcium ions are present.movement7)8)9)cross bridge breaksmyosin head reattaches to the next binding siteWhen Excitation Stops, Calcium Ions Leave1) When the muscle stops being stimulated, calcium ions leave their binding sites and are moved by active transport back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (this needs ATP too).2) This causes the tropomyosin molecules to move back, so they block the actin-myosin binding sites again.3) Muscles aren't contracted because no myosin heads are attached mm to actin filaments (so there are no actin-myosin cross bridges).4) The actin filaments slide back to their relaxed position, which lengthens the sarcomere.actin filaments slide backtropomyosin blocks the binding sites againTopic 6B \u2014 Nervous Coordination\n","48":"146Topic 6C \u2014 HomeostasisHomeostasis BasicsAh, there's nothing like learning a nice long word to start you off on a new section \u2014 welcome to homeostasis.Homeostasis is the Maintenance of a Stable Internal Environment1) Changes in your external environment can affect your internal environment\u2014 the blood and tissue fluid that surrounds your cells.2) Homeostasis involves control systems that keep your internal environment roughly constant (within certain limits).3) Keeping your internal environment stable is vital for cells to function normally and to stop them being damaged.4) It's particularly important to maintain the right core body temperature and blood pH. This is because temperature and pH affect enzyme activity, and enzymes control the rate of metabolic reactions:\u2022 If body temperature is too high (e.g. 40 \u00b0C) enzymes may becomc denatured. The enzyme's molecules vibrate too much, which breaks the hydrogen bonds that hold them in their 3D shape.The shape of the enzyme's active site is changed and it no longer works as a catalyst.This means metabolic reactions are less efficient.\u2022 If body temperature is too low enzyme activity is reduced, slowing the rate of metabolic reactions.\u2022 The highest rate of enzyme activity happens at their optimum temperature (about 37 \u00b0C in humans).\u2022 If blood pH is too high or too low (highly alkaline or acidic) enzymes become denatured. The hydrogen bonds that hold them in their 3D shape are broken, so the shape of the enzyme's active site is changed and it no longer works as a catalyst. This means metabolic reactions are less efficient.\u2022 The highest rate of enzyme activity happens at their optimum pH \u2014 usually around pH 7 (neutral), but some enzymes work best at other pHs, e.g. enzymes found in the stomach work best at a low pH.5) It's important to maintain the right concentration of glucose in the blood because cells need glucose for energy. Blood glucose concentration also affects the water potential of blood \u2014 this is the potential (likelihood)of water molecules to diffuse out of or into a solution.\u2022 If blood glucose concentration is too high the water potential of blood is reduced to a point where water molecules diffuse out of cells into the blood by osmosis.This can cause the cells to shrivel up and die.\u2022 If blood glucose concentration is too low, cells are unable to carry out normal activities because there isn't enough glucose for respiration to provide energy.Homeostatic Systems Detect a Change and Respond by Negative Feedback1)2)3)4)5)6)Homeostatic systems involve receptors, a communication system and effectors (like the nervous system \u2014 see page 128).Receptors detect when a level is too high or too low, and the information's communicated via the nervous system or the hormonal system to effectors.The effectors respond to counteract the change \u2014 bringing the level back to normal. The mechanism that restores the level to normal is called a negative feedback mechanism.Negative feedback keeps things around the normal level, e.g. body temperature is usually kept within 0.5 \u00b0C above or below 37 \u00b0C.Negative feedback only works within certain limits though \u2014 if the change is too big then the effectors may not be able to counteract it, e.g. a huge drop in body temperature caused by prolonged exposure to cold weather may be too large to counteract.Control of body temperature by negative feedback:body detects temperature's too hotyour internal environment stays around the normal level (37 \u00b0C)body detects temperature's too coldeffectors respond to increase the temperaturetimea>ouJ3u\nTopic 6C \u2014 Homeostasis\n","49":"148Control of Blood Glucose ConcentrationThese pages are all about how homeostasis sorts out your blood glucose level so you can keep revising.Eating and Exercise Change the Concentration of Glucose in your Blood1) All cells need a constant energy supply to work \u2014 so blood glucose concentration must be carefully controlled.2) The concentration of glucose in the blood is normally around 90 mg per 100 cm3 of blood.It's monitored by cells in the pancreas.3) Blood glucose concentration rises after eating food containing carbohydrate.Blood glucose concentration falls after exercise, as more glucose is used in respiration to release energy.Insulin and Glucagon Control Blood Glucose ConcentrationThe hormonal system controls blood glucose concentration using two hormones called insulin and glucagon.Like all hormones, insulin and glucagon travel in the blood to .... , ,, ,their target cells (effectors).

This involves increasing the number of channel proteins in the cell membranes (see next page for more).Insulin also activates enzymes in liver and muscle cells that convert glucose into glycogen. The cells are able to store glycogen in their cytoplasm, as an energy source.The process of forming glycogen from glucose is called glycogenesis.Insulin also increases the rate of respiration of glucose, especially in muscle cells.i |l I II I \/11 ir Liver cells are C f also called E^ Hepatocytes. ~\/' I I I I W I | | | |\\N\"GLYCOGENGlucagon raises blood glucose concentration when it's too lowglycogenesis 11 glycogenolysiss \\l ^activated activatedby insulin \u00bb by glucagon^ .I gluconeogenesisGLYCEROL AMINO ACIDS1) Glucagon binds to specific receptors on the cell membranes of liver cells.2) Glucagon activates enzymes in liver cells that break down glycogen into glucose3) The process of breaking down glycogen is called glycogenolysis.4) Glucagon also activates enzymes that are involved in the formation of glucose from glycerol (a component of lipids) and amino acids.5) The process of forming glucose from non-carbohydrates is called gluconeogenesis6) Glucagon decreases the rate of respiration of glucose in cells.Because they travel in the blood to their target cells, the responses produced by hormones are slower than those produced by nervous impulses (which are very quick \u2014 see page 129). Hormones are not broken down as quickly as neurotransmitters though, so their effects tend to last for longer.Negative Feedback Mechanisms Keep Blood Glucose Concentration Normal|3 cells secrete insulin pancreas detects blooda cells stop secreting glucagon glucose concentrationinsulin binds to receptors on liver and muscle cellsis too high\u2022 cells take up more glucosei 4.- -u j less qlucose\u2022 qlycoqenesis is activated 3 ,ii , \u0000 in the blood\u2022 cells respire more glucose~ 'Genesis' means making \u2014 r \u2014 so glycogenesis means - r making glycogen. - \"\/, i , | II h \\i \\ n if i'1111'Topic 6C \u2014 Homeostasisrise in blood glucose _[j__________ concentrationNORMAL BLOOD GLUCOSE CONCENTRATION1 V , 1 \"  \"  '  I I  \/  1 1  w  \/  ,,,.- Lysis means splitting' \u2014 -- so glycogenolysis means ~- splitting glycogen.

One example of this is diabetes...Diabetes Occurs when Blood Glucose Concentration is Not ControlledDiabetes mellitus is a condition where blood glucose concentration can't be controlled properly. There are two types:1) In Type I diabetes, the immune system attacks the (3 cells in the islets of Langerhans so they can't produce any insulin. No one knows exactly what causes the immune system to do this.Scientists have found that some people have a genetic predisposition to developing Type I diabetes. They also think that the disease may be triggered by a viral infection.2) After eating, the blood glucose level rises and stays high \u2014 this is called hyperglycaemia and can result in death if left untreated. The kidneys can't reabsorb all this glucose, so some of it's excreted in the urine.3) Type 1 diabetes is treated with insulin therapy. Most people with Type I diabetes need regular insulin injections throughout the day, but some people use an insulin pump to deliver insulin continuously instead. Insulin therapy has to be carefully controlled because too much insulin can produce a dangerous drop in blood glucose levels \u2014 this is called hypoglycaemia.4) Eating regularly and controlling simple carbohydrate intake (intake of sugars) helps to avoid a sudden rise in glucose.1) Type II diabetes is usually acquired later in life than Type I. It is often linked with obesity and is more likely in people with a family history of the condition. Other risk factors include lack of exercise, age and poor diet.2) It occurs when the |3 cells don't produce enough insulin or when the body's cells don't respond properly to insulin. Cells don't respond properly because the insulin receptors on their membranes don't work properly, so the cells don't take up enough glucose. This means the blood glucose concentration is higher than normal.3) It can be treated by eating a healthy, balanced diet, losing weight (if necessary) and regular exercise. Glucose-lowering medication can be taken if diet and exercise can't control it. Eventually, insulin injections may be needed.Type II Diabetes is a Growing Health Problem1) Type II diabetes is becoming increasingly common in the UK. This has been linked to increasing levels of obesity, a move towards more unhealthy diets and low levels of physical activity.2) Type II diabetes can cause additional health problems, including visual impairment and kidney failure, so health advisors are understandably keen to educate people about the risks and reduce the incidenceof the disease. Some people also think the food industry has a role to play in tackling the problem.3) You need to understand the various responses to the increase in Type II diabetes and be able to evaluate them.To reduce the risk of developing Type II diabetes, health advisors recommend that people:\u2022 eat a diet that's low in fat, sugar and salt, with plenty of whole grains, fruit and vegetables,\u2022 take regular exercise,\u2022 lose weight if necessary.Campaigns like the NHS's 'Change4Life', aim to educate people on how to have a healthier diet and lifestyle, and so reduce their risk of developing conditions like Type II diabetes.Health advisors have also challenged the food industry to reduce the advertising of junk food (particularly to children), to improve the nutritional value of their products, and to use clearer labelling on products \u2014 allowing consumers to make healthier choices about what to buy.w 1111111111 u h 111 ii \\ 111 ii 111111 \\ \\ h 111,In response to criticism, some food companies have z Some people believe that diet varieties are not zattempted to make their products more healthy, e.g. 5 as 300^ ^or health as they are claimed to be, z.. r ,, 1 . 1 - e.q. there is some evidence to suqaest that\u2022 using sugar alternatives to sweeten tood\/drinks, z Jr \u0000 , . , ,. . ,. z 00 ^ artificial sweeteners are linked to weight gain. ^\u2022 reducing the sugar, fat and salt content of products. 111111 w 11 n n 1 u 1111111111 w 111111 uHowever, there is pressure on companies to increase profits.

This process is called ultrafiltration.4) Useful substances, such as glucose and the right amount of water, are then reabsorbed back into the blood. This process is called selective reabsorption.5) The remaining unwanted substances pass along to the bladder and are excreted as urine.Blood is Filtered at the Start of the NephronsThe long tubules along with the bundle of capillarieswhere the blood is filtered are called nephrons \u2014there are around one million nephrons in each kidney.1) Blood from the renal artery enters smaller arterioles in the cortex of the kidney.2) Each arteriole splits into a structure called a glomerulus (plural, glomeruli) \u2014 a bundle of capillaries looped inside a hollow ball called a Bowman's capsule.3) This is where ultrafiltration takes place.4) The arteriole that takes blood into each glomerulus is called the afferent arteriole, and the arteriole that takes the filtered blood away from the glomerulus is called the efferent arteriole.5) The efferent arteriole is smaller in diameter than the afferent arteriole, so the blood in the glomerulus is under high pressure.6) The high pressure forces liquid and small molecules in the blood out of the capillary and into the Bowman's capsule.7) The liquid and small molecules pass through three layers to get into the Bowman's capsule and enter the nephron tubules \u2014 the capillary wall, a membrane (called the basement membrane) and the epithelium of the Bowman's capsule.8) Larger molecules like proteins and blood cells can't pass through, so stay in the blood. The substances that enter the Bowman's capsule are known as the glomerular filtrate.UltrafiltrationStructure of the Kidneys renal renal\n\u00a9CAPILLARYlarger molecules can't pass througho slit in BOWMAN'S, epithelium CAPSULE *basementmembranesmall molecules forced through11 *111 m 11111Ti i n i; ii, 5 You need to learn the = ~ structure of a nephron.

Instead you take samples:1) Choose an area to sample \u2014 a small area within the area being investigated.2) Samples should be random to avoid bias, e.g. if you were investigating a field you could pick random samplesites by dividing the field into a grid and using a random number generator to select coordinates.3) Use an appropriate technique to take a sample of the population (see below).4) Repeat the process, taking as many samples as possible.This will reduce the likelihood that your results are down to chance.5) The number of individuals for the whole area can then be estimated by taking the mean ofthe data collected in each sample and multiplying it by the size of the whole area.Quadrats and Transects are used to Investigate Non-Motile OrganismsNon-motile organisms are ones that don't move about\u2014 like plants. Quadrats and transects can also be used to investigate slow-moving organisms, which include things like limpets.1) A quadrat is a square frame, usually divided into a grid of 100 smaller squares by strings attached across the frame.2) Quadrats are placed on the ground at different points within the area you're investigating.3) The species frequency (how often a species is found) or the number of individuals of each species is recorded in each quadrat.4) The percentage cover of a species can also be measured by counting how much of the quadrat is covered by the speciesthe area of this quadrat is 0.25 rrMeasuring % cover0.5 mI I Species A [~ ~ l Specif, B 42 squares 12 squaresyou count a square if it's more than half-covered.

To cover a larger distance, quadrats can be placed at intervals along the line (i.e. with spaces in between them). This is known as an interrupted belt transect.Mark-Release-Recapture is Used to Investigate More Motile SpeciesMark-release-recapture is a method used to measure the abundance of more motile species. Here's how it's done:1) Capture a sample of a species using an appropriate technique, e.g. you could use pitfall traps(a steep sided container sunk into the ground) to capture ground insects, and count them.2) Mark them in a harmless way, e.g. by putting a spot of paint on them, or by removing a tuft of fur.3) Release them back into their habitat.4) Wait a week, then take a second sample from the same population.5) Count how many of the second sample are marked.You can then use this equation to estimate the total population size.When using this method, you have to make a few assumptions:1) The marked sample has had enough time and opportunity to mix back in with the population.2) The marking hasn't affected the individuals' chances of survival (e.g. by making them more visible to predators), and the marking itself is still visible (e.g. it hasn't rubbed off).3) There are no changes in population size due to births, deaths and migration during the period of the study.Topic 7C \u2014 Populations in EcosystemsJ0ta| Number caught Number caughtpopulation = 'n sample in 2nd samplesize ____________Number marked in 2nd sample\n","53":"776SuccessionRepeat after me: successful succession involves several simple successive stages.Succession is the Process of Ecosystem ChangeEcosystems are dynamic \u2014 they are constantly changing. Succession is the process by which an ecosystem(see p. 170) changes over time. The biotic conditions (e.g. plant and animal communities) change n H , M mn 11\/as the abiotic conditions (e.g. water availability) change. There are two types of succession: ^ Remember \u20141) Primary succession \u2014 this happens on land that's been newly formed or exposed, e.g. ~ Abiotic ^non-tving' where a volcano has erupted to form a new rock surface, or where sea level has droppedexposing a new area of land. There's no soil or organic material to start with, e.g. just bare rock.2) Secondary succession \u2014 this happens on land that's been cleared of all the plants, but where the soil remains, e.g. after a forest fire or where a forest has been cut down by humans.Succession Occurs in a Series of Stages1)\n2)3)4)5)Primary succession starts when species colonise a new land surface. Seeds and spores are blown in by the wind and begin to grow. The first species to colonise the area are called pioneer species.\u2022 The abiotic conditions are hostile (harsh), e.g. there's no soil to retain water. Only pioneer species grow because they're specially adapted to cope with the harsh conditions, e.g. marram grass can grow on sand dunes near the sea because it has deep roots to get water and can tolerate the salty environment.\u2022 The pioneer species change the abiotic conditions \u2014 they die and microorganisms decompose the dead organic material (humus). This forms a basic soil.\u2022 This makes conditions less hostile, e.g. the basic soil helps to retain water, which means new organisms with different adaptations can move in and grow. These then die and are decomposed, adding more organic material, making the soil deeper and richer in minerals. This means larger plants like shrubs can start to grow in the deeper soil, which retains even more water.\u2022 Some new species may change (he environment so that it becomes less suitable for the previous species.E.g. sand sedge stabilises the sand through the growth of rhizomes (underground stems). This makes the conditions less suitable for marram grass, which needs constant reburial by sand in order to grow healthily.Secondary succession happens in the same way, but because there's already a soil layer succession starts at a later stage \u2014 the pioneer species in secondary succession are larger plants, e.g. shrubs.At each stage, different plants and animals that are better adapted for the improved conditions move in, out-compete the plants and animals that are already there, and become the dominant species in the ecosystem. As succession goes on, the ecosystem becomes more complex. New species move in alongside existing species, which means that biodiversity (the variety of living organisms) increases. xw 11M 111 m M ,The final stage is called the climax community \u2014 the ecosystem - This ----is supporting the largest and most complex community of plants and animals it can.

The soil continues to deepen as the larger plants die and are decomposed.4) Shrubs, ferns and small trees begin to grow, out-competing the grasses and smaller plants to become the dominant species. Diversity increases.5) Finally, the soil is deep and rich enough in nutrients to support large trees. These become the dominant species, and the climax community is formed.1111i11111111111 2)thin soilsmall trees (rowan and alder)fernslarge treesand ash)deep soilTopic 7C \u2014 Populations in Ecosystems\n","54":"178ConservationWho'cJ have thought conservation could be such a tricky business \u2014 cos I'm feeling nice, I'll try and explain why...There Can be Conflict Between Human Needs and Conservation1) Conservation is the protection and management of species and habitats (ecosystemsi in a sustainable way. Sustainable means that enough resources are taken to meet the needs of people today, without reducing the ability of people in the future to meet their own needs.2) Not everyone agrees with every conservation measure though \u2014 there's often conflict between human needs and conservation. Careful management is needed to find a balance between the two and maintain the sustainability of natural resources. Here's an example:\u2022 The Maasai Mara is a national reserve in Kenya. It's a large area of grassland (savannah) with lots of wildlife.\u2022 The Maasai people traditionally earn a living by raising livestock, such as cattle. This can bring them into conflict with conservationists \u2014 e.g. overgrazing by livestock can destroy grassland for wildlife.\u2022 Conservation trusts are working with the Maasai to help them make money from their land through conservation and ecotourism projects rather than farming, and to farm in a sustainable way. So the economic needs of the Maasai are met, while still allowing the area and its wildlife to be conserved.3) There are many different methods of conservation. Some focus on conserving a particular species, whilst others protect the habitat for all the species that live there. Here are some examples of conservation techniques:\u2022 Plants can be conserved using seedbanks, which are stores of lots of seeds from lots of different plant species. If the plants become extinct in the wild, the stored seeds can be used to grow new plants.\u2022 Fishing quotas are limits to the amount of certain fish species that fishermen are allowed to catch.Fishing quotas help to conserve fish species by reducing the numbers that are caught and killed.\u2022 Protected areas such as national parks and nature reserves protect habitats (and so protect the species in them) by restricting urban development, industrial development and farming.\u2022 Endangered species can be bred in captivity (e.g. a zoo) to increase their numbers, then returned to the wild.You May Have to Evaluate Evidence and Data About Conservation IssuesYou need to be able to evaluate any evidence or data about conservation projects and research that the examiners throw at you \u2014 so here's an example I made earlier:In recent years, native British bluebells have become less common in woodland areas. It's thought that this is due to the presence of non-native Spanish bluebells, which compete with the native species for a similar niche.An experiment was carried out to see if removing the invasive Spanish species would help to conserve the native species. Each year for 15 years the percentage cover of native species was estimated in a 50 m by 50 m area of woodland using random sampling and 250, 1 m2 quadrats. After five years, all the Spanish bluebells were removed. A similar-sized control woodland in which the Spanish bluebells remained untouched was also studied. The results are shown on the right. You might be asked to:= 100806040% cover of native British bluebells in a woodland\u2022Spanish species removed5 10years151) Describe the data:\u2022 For the first five years, the percentage cover of native bluebells fell \u0000 ^from 50% to around 25%. After the Spanish species was removed, it increased from around 25% to around 45% in ten years.\u2022 The control experiment shows a fairly steady drop in native bluebell ^ percentage cover from 60% to 20% over the 15 years.2) Draw conclusions:The removal of Spanish bluebells resulted in an increase in the percentage cover of native bluebells over a ten year period. This suggests that the recent decrease in native British bluebells is due to competition with the Spanish bluebells.3) Ey^l.UAte_the..methQd;\u2022 The effects of some olher variables (e.g. changing weather) were removed by the control experiment, where the percentage cover of native bluebells continued to fall throughout the 15-year study.

You've already covered mutations in Topic 4, but now you need to know about them in more detail.Mutations are Changes to the Base Sequence of DNA1) Any change to the base (nucleotide) sequence of DNA is called a mutation.2) Mutations can be caused by errors during DNA replication.3) The rate of mutation can be increased by mutagenic agents (see next page).4) The types of mutations that can occur include:\u2022 Substitution \u2014 one or more bases are swapped for another, e.g. ATGCCT becomes ATTCCT.\u2022 Deletion \u2014 one or more bases are removed, e.g. ATGCCT becomes ATCCT.\u2022 Addition \u2014 one or more bases are added, e.g. ATGCCT becomes ATGACCT.\u2022 Duplication \u2014 one or more bases are repeated, e.g. ATGCCT becomes ATGCCCCT.\u2022 Inversion \u2014 a sequence of bases is reversed, e.g. ATGCCT becomes ACCGTT.\u2022 Translocation \u2014 a sequence of bases is moved from one location in the genome to another.This could be movement within the same chromosome or movement to a different chromosome.5) The order of DNA bases in a gene determines the sequence of amino acids in a particular polypeptide. If a mutation occurs in a gene, the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide that it codes for could be changed.OriginalgeneMutatedgeneC T J__Lc_LA G AI 1 1G GI__Isubstitution here G C A......................G AJ\u2014L.G G J\u2014IDNAAmino acidOriginalGCTAlaninepolypeptideGATAspartic acidCAGGlutamineMutatedAGGArgininepolypeptideAlanine \u2014 Glutamine \u2014 Arginine6) Polypeptides make up proteins. A change in the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide may change the final 3D shape of the protein, which could mean that it doesn't work properly. E.g. a mutation in a polypeptide that makes up an enzyme may change the shape of the enzyme's active site. This may stop substrates from being able to bind to the active site, leaving the enzyme unable to catalyse the reaction.7) Some mutations can cause genetic disorders \u2014 inherited disorders caused by abnormal genes or chromosomes, e.g. cystic fibrosis. Some mutations can increase the likelihood of developing certain cancers, e.g. mutations of the gene BRCA1 can increase the chances of developing breast cancer.8) If a gamete (sex cell) containing a mutation for a genetic disorder or a type of 1 1\"11'111'1\"'1 > \/ n\/,cancer is fertilised, the mutation will be present in the new fetus formed \u2014 5 *ier\u00ae^'tary mutations 5these are called hereditary mutations because they are passed on to the offspring. \u00a3 hereditary mutati^^cr31 ^3. evolution (see page 166).

There are lots of different types of cancer, but they all involve uncontrolled cell growth and all have potentially devastating effects. Here's more on how cancer can occur...Mutations in Genes Can Cause Uncontrolled Cell Growth1) Mutations that occur in individual cells after fertilisation (e.g. in adulthood) are called acquired mutations.2) If these mutations occur in the genes that control the rate of cell division (by mitosis), it can cause uncontrolled cell division.3) If a cell divides uncontrollably the result is a tumour \u2014 a mass of abnormal cells.Tumours that invade and destroy surrounding tissue are called cancers (see below).4) There are two types of gene that control cell division \u2014 tumour suppressor genesand proto-oncogenes. Mutations in these genes can cause cancer:Tumour suppressor genes can be inactivated if a mutation occurs in the DNA sequence.\nIf a mutation occurs in a tumour suppressor gene, the protein isn't produced. The cells divide uncontrollably (the rate of division increases) resulting in a tumour.The effect of a proto-oncogene can be increasedif a mutation occurs in the DNA sequence.A mutated proto-oncogene is called an oncogene.Proto-oncogeneIWhen functioning normally, proto-oncogenes stimulate cell division by producing proteins that make cells divide.Oncogene\nIf a mutation occurs in a proto-oncogene, the gene can become overactive. This stimulates the cells to divide uncontrollably (the rate of division increases) resulting in a tumour.Tumours can be Benign or Malignant (Cancerous)Tumours can develop for years without any obvious symptoms and can be quite large by the time they're discovered. Not all tumours are cancerous \u2014 there are two different types:1) Malignant tumours are cancers. They usually grow rapidly and invade and destroy surrounding tissues.Cells can break off the tumours and spread to other parts of the body in the bloodstream or lymphatic system.2) Benign tumours are not cancerous. They usually grow slower than malignant tumours and are often covered in fibrous tissue that stops cells invading other tissues. Benign tumours are often harmless,but they can cause blockages and put pressure on organs. Some benign tumours can become malignant.Tumour Cells Look and Function Differently to Normal CellsTumour cells can differ from normal cells in many different ways:1) They have an irregular shape.2) The nucleus is larger and darker than in normal cells. aSometimes the cells have more than one nucleus.3) They don't produce all the proteins needed to function correctly.4) They have different antigens on their surface.5) They don't respond to growth regulating processes.6) They divide (by mitosis) more frequently than normal cells.Topic 8A \u2014 Mutations and Gene ExpressionWhen functioning normally, tumour suppressor genes slow cell division by producing proteins that stop cells dividing or cause them to self-destruct (apoptosis).\n","57":"196 Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Proiects and Gene TechnologiesGenome Projects and Making DNA FragmentsGene technologies are seriously amazing. From sequencing the entire human genome to chopping out bits of DNA to insert into other organisms, you never know what scientists will get up to next.Sequencing Projects Have Read Entire Genomes1) A genome is the entire set of DNA, including all the genes in an organism.2) Improvements in technology have allowed us to sequence thegenomes of a variety of organisms, from bacteria to humans.3) Gene sequencing methods only work on fragments of DNA. So if you want to sequence the entire genome of an organism, you need to chop it up into smaller pieces first. The smaller pieces are sequenced and then put back in order to give the sequence of the whole genome.4) The Human Genome Project, which was completed in 2003, mapped the entire sequence of the human genome for the first time.Sequencing the Genome of Simple Organisms Helps Identify their Proteins1) The proteome of an organism is all the proteins that are made by it.2) You might remember from Topic 4 that while some parts of the genome code for specific proteins, some parts don't code for anything at all (the DNA is non-coding).3) Simple organisms, such as bacteria, don't have much non-coding DNA.4) This means it is relatively easy to determine their proteome from the DNA sequence of their genome.5) This can be useful in medical research and development. For example, identifying the protein antigens on thesurface of disease-causing bacteria and viruses can help in the development of vaccines to prevent the disease.N. meningitidis group B bacteria cause meningitis B. Sequencing the genome of these bacteria helped researchers identify antigens for use in developing a vaccine against the disease.Remember: vaccines contain antigens that cause your body to produce memory cells. If you're later infected by a pathogen with - the same antigens, your memory cells will quickly recognise it and divide to produce antibodies against it \u2014 so you don't get sick.Example:It\u2019s Harder to Translate the Genome of Complex Organisms1) More complex organisms contain large sections of non-coding DNA.2) They also contain complex regulatory genes, which determine when the genes that code for particular proteins should be switched on and off.3) This makes it more difficult to translate their genome into their proteome, because it's hard to find the bits that code for proteins among thenon-coding and regulatory DNA. Yes, Sofia was quite4) However, work is being done on the human proteome. The codes for sure she didn't needmore than 30 000 human proteins have been identified so far. any more sequin-cing.Sequencing Methods are Continuously Updated1) In the past, many sequencing methods were labour-intensive, expensive and could only be done on a small scale.2) Now these techniques are often automated, more cost-effective and can be done on a large scale.3) For example, pyrosequencing is a recently developed technique that can sequence around400 million bases in a ten hour period (which is super fast compared to older techniques).4) With newer, faster techniques such as pyrosequencing available, scientists can now sequence whole genomes much more quickly.Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n","58":"797Genome Projects and Making DNA FragmentsRecombinant DNA Technology Involves Transferring Fragments of DNA1) Recombinant DNA technology involves transferring a fragment of DNA from one organism to another.2) Because the genetic code is universal (the same DNA base triplets code for the same amino acids in all living things), and because transcription and translation mechanisms are pretty similar too, the transferred DNA can be used to produce a protein in the cells of the recipient organism. The recipient and donor organisms don't even have to be from the same species. This can be pretty useful \u2014 see page 201. Organisms that contain transferred DNA are known as transgenic organisms.DNA Fragments Can Be Made in Different WaysIn order to transfer a gene from one organism to another, you first need to get a DNA fragment containing the gene you're interested in (the target gene). There are three ways that DNA fragments can be produced:(V ) Using Reverse Transcriptase1) Most cells only contain two copies of each gene, making it difficult to obtain a DNA fragment containing the target gene. But they can contain many mRNA molecules which are complementary to the gene, so mRNA is often easier to obtain.2) The mRNA molecules can be used as templates to make lots of DNA.The enzyme, reverse transcriptase, makes DNA from an RNA template.The DNA produced is called complementary DNA (cDNA).3) For example, pancreatic cells produce the protein insulin. They have loads of mRNA molecules complementary to the insulin gene, but only two copies of the gene itself. So reverse transcriptase could be used to make cDNA from the insulin mRNA.4) To do this, mRNA is first isolated from cells. Then it's mixed with free DNA nucleotides and reverse transcriptase. The reverse transcriptase uses the mRNA as a template to synthesise a new strand of cDNA.You should remember *from Topic 4 that DNA is copied into mRNA during transcription.DNA sequence\u201ci\u2014rTATGCA A U A C G U U_l__I__I__L_J_____I...complementary mRNA sequence\n(? ) Using Restriction Endonuclease Enzymespalindromic sequenceReads- GAATTOC G G C\u201ci\u2014iT TA Arecognition sequence Tfragment you want^ restriction enzyme added (EcoRI)1) Some sections of DNA have palindromic sequences of nucleotides.These sequences consist of antiparallel base pairs (base pairs that read the same in opposite directions). Reads: gaattc2) Restriction endonucleases arc enzymes that recognise specific palindromic sequences (known as recognition sequences) and cut (digest) the DNA at these places.3) Different restriction endonucleases cut at different specific recognition sequences, because the shape of the recognition sequence is complementary to the enzyme's active site.E.g. the restriction endonuclease EcoR\\ cuts at GAATTC, but Hind\\\\\\ cuts at AAGCTT.4) If recognition sequences are present at either side of the DNA fragment you want, you can use restriction endonucleases to separate it from the rest of the DNA.5) The DNA sample is incubated with the specific restriction endonuclease, which cuts the DNA fragment out via a hydrolysis reaction.6) Sometimes the cut leaves sticky ends g- \u2014 small tails of unpaired bases at each end of the fragment. Sticky ends can be used to bind (anneal) the DNA fragment to another piece of DNA that has sticky ends with complementary sequences (there's more about this on p. 199).double-strandedDNArecognition sequenceDNA\nG\\A A T T C G C \\f \" T* \"a \u2019 A\"*G Ci \\i i i i * i i \\EcoRI cuts hereT G A C-i\u2014i\u2014r*A A \u2022 GEcoRI cuts hereC\\TA Arrsticky endDNAfragment you wantsticky endTopic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n","59":"199Amplifying DNA FragmentsOnce you've got your teeny tiny fragment of DNA, you need to amplify it so you've got lots and lots to play with...In Vivo Amplification Involves Transforming Host CellsOnce you've isolated your DNA fragment (using one of the techniques on pages 197-198) you need to amplify it (make lots of copies of it) so you have a sufficient quantity to work with. One way of doing this is to use in vivo cloning \u2014 this is where copies of the DNA fragment are made inside a living organism.Step 1 \u2014 The DNA Fragment is Inserted into a Vector1) The DNA fragment is inserted into vector DNA \u2014 ~r-. . . , , , , , , , Vectora vector is something that's used to transfer DNA \u00a9 tagcttaagcta DNAinto a cell.

This process is called ligation.4) The new combination of bases in the DNA (vector DNA + DNA fragment) is called recombinant DNA.Step 2 \u2014 The Vector Transfers the DNA Fragment into Host Cells1) The vector with the recombinant DNA is used to transfer the gene into cells (called host cells).2) If a plasmid vector is used, host cells have to be persuaded to take in the plasmid vector and its DNA.E.g. host bacterial cells are placed into ice-cold calcium chloride solution to make their cell walls more permeable. The plasmids are added and the mixture is heat-shocked (heated to around 42 \u00b0C for 1-2 minutes), which encourages the cells to take in the plasmids.3) With a bacteriophage vector, the bacteriophage will infect the host bacterium by injecting its DNA into it. The phage DNA (with the target gene in it) then integrates into the bacterial DNA.4) Host cells that take up the vectors containing the gene of interest are said to be transformed.Step 3 \u2014 Identifying Transformed Host CellsOnly around 5% of host cells will take up the vector and its DNA, so it's important to be able to identify which cells have been transformed. Marker genes can be used to identify the transformed cells:1) Marker genes can be inserted into vectors at the same time as the gene to be cloned.This means any transformed host cells will contain the gene to be cloned and the marker gene.2) Host cells are grown on agar plates. Each cell divides and replicates its DNA, creating a colony of cloned cells. Transformed cells will produce colonies where all the cells contain the cloned gene and the marker gene.3) The marker gene can code for antibiotic resistance \u2014 host cells are grown on agar plates containing the specific antibiotic, so only transformed cells that have the marker gene will survive and grow. Or it can code for fluorescence \u2014 when the agar plate is placed under a UV light only transformed cells will fluoresce.4) Identified transformed cells are allowed to grow more, producing lots and lots of copies of the cloned gene.To Produce Proteins You Need Promoter and Terminator Regions1) If you want the transformed host cells to produce the protein coded for by the DNA fragment,you need to make sure that the vector contains specific promoter and terminator regions.2) Promoter regions are DNA sequences that tell the enzyme RNA polymerase when to start producing mRNA. Terminator regions tell it when to stop. Without the right promoter region, the DNA fragment won't be transcribed by the host cell and a protein won't be made.3) Promoter and terminator regions may be present in the vector DNA or they may have to be added in along with the fragment.Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n","60":"201Using Recombinant DNA TechnologyNow that you know how to make a DNA fragment and amplify it, it's probably a good time to tell you why you might want to.

Mwah ha hah.Transformed Organisms Are Made Using Recombinant DNA Technology1) Microorganisms, plants and animals can all be transformed using recombinant DNA technology. This is called genetic engineering.2) Transformed microorganisms can be made using the same technology as in vivo cloning (see page 199). For example, foreign DNA can be inserted into microorganisms to produce lots of useful protein, e.g. insulin:jvM \/1 \" 1 I I \" , , , , , , , , I , 1 , # ( !

( I\\\n3)4)5)Transformed plants can also be produced. A gene that codes for a desirable protein is inserted into a plasmid. The plasmid is added to a bacterium and the bacterium is used as a vector to get the gene into the plant cells.If the right promoter region has been added along with the gene (see p. 199), the transformed cells will be able to produce the desired protein.Transformed animals can be produced too \u2014 a gene that codes for a desirable protein can be inserted into an early animal embryo or into the egg cells of a female. If the gene is inserted into a very early embryo, all the body cells of the resulting transformed animal will end up containing the gene. Inserting it into the egg cells means that when the female reproduces, all the cells of her offspring will contain the gene.Promoter regions that are only activated in specific cell types can be used to control exactly which of an animal's body cells the protein is produced in. If the protein is only produced in certain cells, it can be harvested more easily. Producing the protein in the wrong cells could also damage the organism.Recombinant DNA Technology Can be Used to Benefit HumansTransformed organisms (microorganisms, plants and animals) can be used in a variety of ways. You need to be able to interpret information about how they are used. Here are some examples:AgricultureAgricultural crops can be transformed so that they give higher yields or are more nutritious. This means these plants can be used to reduce the risk of famine and malnutrition. Crops can also be transformed to have pest resistance, so that fewer pesticides are needed. This reduces costs and reduces any environmental problems associated with using pesticides.For example, Golden Rice is a variety of transformed rice. It contains one gene from a maize plant and one gene from a soil bacterium, which together enable the rice to produce beta-carotene. The beta-carotene is used by our bodies to produce vitamin A. Golden Rice is being developed to reduce vitamin A deficiency in areas where there's a shortage of dietary vitamin A, e.g. south Asia, Africa. Vitamin A deficiency is a big problem in these areas, e.g. up to 500 000 children per year worldwide go blind due to vitamin A deficiency.IndustryIndustrial processes often use biological catalysts (enzymes). These enzymes can be produced from transformed organisms, so they can be produced in large quantities for less money, reducing costs.For example, chymosin (or rennin) is an enzyme used in cheese-making. It used to be made from rennet (a substance produced in the stomach of cows), but it can now be produced by transformed organisms. This means it can be made in large quantities, relatively cheaply and without killing any cows, making some cheese suitable for vegetarians.MedicineMany drugs and vaccines are produced by transformed organisms, using recombinant DNA technology. They can be made quickly, cheaply and in large quantities using this method.For example, insulin is used to treat Type 1 diabetes and used to come from animals (cow, horse or pig pancreases). This insulin wasn't human insulin though, so it didn't work quite as well. Human insulin is now made from transformed microorganisms, using a cloned human insulin gene (see above).Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n","61":"202Using Recombinant DNA TechnologyThere are Concerns About the Use of Recombinant DNA Technology...There are ethical, financial and social issues associated with the use of recombinant DNA technology:AgricultureFarmers might plant only one type of transformed crop (this is called monoculture). This could make the whole crop vulnerable to the same disease because the plants are genetically identical. Environmentalists are also concerned about monocultures reducing biodiversity, as this could damage the environment.Some people are concerned about the possibility of 'superweeds' \u2014 weeds that are resistant to herbicides. These could occur if transformed crops interbreed with wild plants. There could then be an uncontrolled spread of recombinant DNA, with unknown consequences.Organic farmers can have their crops contaminated by wind-blown seeds from nearby genetically modified crops. This means they can't sell their crop as organic and may lose their income.IndustryAnti-globalisation activists oppose globalisation (e.g. the growth of large multinational companies at the expense of smaller ones). A few, large biotechnology companies control some forms of genetic engineering. As the use of this technology increases, these companies get bigger and more powerful. This may force smaller companies out of business, e.g. by making it harder for them to compete. Without proper labelling, some people think they won't have a choice about whether to consume food made using genetically engineered organisms.Some consumer markets, such as the EU, won't import GM foods and products. This can cause an economic loss to producers who have traditionally sold to those markets.MedicineCompanies who own genetic engineering technologies may limit the use of technologies that could be saving lives.Some people worry this technology could be used unethically, e.g. to make designer babies (babies that have characteristics chosen by their parents). This is currently illegal though.Recombinant DNA technology also creates ownership issues. Here are some examples:\u2022 There is some debate about who owns genetic material from humans once it has been removed from the body \u2014 the donor or the researcher. Some people argue that the individual holds the right to their own genetic information, however others argue that value is created by the researcher who uses it to develop a medicine or in diagnosis.\u2022 A small number of large corporations own patents to particular seeds. They can charge high prices, sometimes including a 'technology fee', and can require farmers to repurchase seeds each year.If non-GM crops are contaminated by GM crops, farmers can be sued for breaching the patent law....But Humanitarians Think it will Benefit PeopleRecombinant DNA technology has many potential humanitarian benefits:1) Agricultural crops could be produced that help reduce the risk of famine and malnutrition, e.g. drought-resistant crops for drought-prone areas.2) Transformed crops could be used to produce useful pharmaceutical products (e.g. vaccines) which could make drugs available to more people, e.g. in areas where refrigeration (usually needed for storing vaccines) isn't available.3) Mcdicines could be produced more chcaply, so more people can afford them.4) Recombinant DNA technology has the potential to be used in gene therapy to treat human diseases (see next page).>0U need to be able z- to balance the humanitarian : r h\/neflts opposing views =- from environmentalists and ~ S ant|-9|obalisat,on activists r(see above) -Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n","62":"204Gene Probes and Medical DiagnosisBeing able to manipulate DNA is also really useful for diagnosing medical problems.You can Look for Alleles Using DNA Probes and Hybridisation-r-PC GG C -i , i__probeT TDNA^1) DNA probes can be used to locate specific alleles of genes (e.g. on chromosomes) or to see if a person's DNA contains a mutated allele that causes a genetic disorder.2) DNA probes are short strands of DNA. They have a specific base sequence t athat's complementary to the base sequence of part of a target allele (the allele you're looking for, e.g. an allele that causes a genetic disorder).3) This means a DNA probe will bind (hybridise) to the target allele if it's present in a sample of DNA.4) A DNA probe also has a label attached, so that it can be detected. The two most common types of label are a radioactive label (detected using X-ray film) or a fluorescent label (detected using UV light)5) Here's how it's done:A A j____i...\nA sample of DNA is digested into fragments using restriction enzymes (see p. 197) and separated using electrophoresis (see p. 206).The separated DNA fragments are then transferred to a nylon membrane and incubated with the fluorescently labelled DNA probe.If the allele is present, the DNA probe will hybridise (bind) to it.The membrane is then exposed to UV light and if the gene is present there will be a fluorescent band. E.g. sample 3 has a visible band, so this patient has the allele6) Alternatively, the probe can be used as part of a DNA microarray, which can screen lots of genes at the same time:A DNA microarray is a glass slide with microscopic spots of different DNA probes attached to it in rows.A sample of fluorescently labelled human DNA is washed over the array.If the labelled human DNA contains any DNA sequences that match any of the probes, it will stick to the array. The array is washed, to remove any labelled DNA that hasn't stuck to it.The array is then visualised underUV light \u2014 any labelled DNA attachedto a probe will show up (fluoresce).Any spot that fluoresces means that the person's DNA contains that specific allele.

Screening for this particular mutation helps determine whether Herceptin\u00ae will be a useful treatment or not.3) ...help identify health risks. E.g. inheriting particular mutated alleles increases your risk of developing certain cancers (although it doesn't make it certain that you'll develop cancer).

However, some people are concerned that genetic screening may lead to discrimination by insurance companies and employers if people are known to have a high risk of developing a condition.Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n","63":"cannot all be purchased.

Very o ft en, these skills will enable an \nentrepreneur to o ff er them to friends and relatives and this \ncould be the start of the business.\n\u25a0 P r e v i o u s  e m p l o y m e n t  e x p e r i e n c e \u00a0\u2013 working for a \nsuccessful hairdresser, for example, allows a potential \nentrepreneur to see the working of such a business \nand judge whether they could set up a similar business \nthemselves.\n\u25a0 F r a n c h i s i n g  c o n f e r e n c e s  and exhibitions \u00a0\u2013 these o ff er a \nwide range of new business start-up ideas, e.g. fast-food \nrestaurants, which also give the potential benefits of the \nsupport of a much larger franchiser business.\n\u25a0 Small-budget market research \u00a0\u2013 the Internet allows any \nuser to browse business directories to see how many \nbusinesses there are in the local area o ff ering certain \ngoods or services. Such small-scale research might indicate \ngaps in local markets that could be profitably filled by the \nentrepreneur.\nSourcing capital (finance)\nOnce the entrepreneur has decided on the business idea \nor opportunity, the next task is to raise the necessary \ncapital. In an International Labour Organization survey \nof new business start-ups, the problem of fi nance came \ntop of the list of replies from entrepreneurs regarding the \nmain di ffi  culty. So why is obtaining fi nance such a major \nproblem for entrepreneurs?\n\u25a0 L a c k  o f  s u ff i c i en t  o w n  fi n a nc e \u00a0\u2013 many entrepreneurs have \nvery limited personal savings, especially if they are setting \nup their own business because they were previously made \nredundant.\n\u25a0 L a c k  o f  a w a r e n e s s  o f  t h e  f i n a n c i a l  s u p p o r t  a n d  g r a n t s  \navailable.\n\u25a0 Lack of any trading record to present to banks as evidence \nof past business success \u00a0\u2013 a trading record would tend to \ngive a bank confidence when deciding to lend money or not \nfor a new venture.\n\u25a0 A poorly produced business plan that fails to convince \npotential investors of the chances of a business\u2019s success.\nDetermining a location\nPerhaps the most important consideration when \nchoosing the location for a new business is the need to \nminimise fi xed costs. When fi nance is limited, it is very \nimportant to try to keep the break-even level of output \u00a0\u2013 \nthe output level that earns enough revenue to cover all \ncosts \u00a0\u2013 as low as possible.

Operating from home is \nthe most common way for entrepreneurs to establish their 8Cambridge International AS and A Level Business","65":"Lack of record keeping\nTh e lack of accurate records is a big reason for business \nfailure. Many entrepreneurs fail to pay su ffi  cient attention \nto this need as either they believe that it is less important \nthan meeting their customers\u2019 needs, or they think \nthey can remember everything. Th e latter will be quite \nimpossible a ft er a period of time. How can the owner of a \nnew, busy fl orist shop remember:\n\u25a0 w h e n  t h e  n e x t  d e l i v e r y  o f  f r e s h  f l o w e r s  i s  d u e ?\n\u25a0 whether the flowers for last week\u2019s big wedding have been \npaid for?\n\u25a0 if the cheque received from the government department \nfor the display of flowers in its reception area has been paid \ninto the bank yet?\n\u25a0 how many hours the shop assistant worked last week?\nTh ere are many other examples that could be given to \nillustrate the crucial importance of keeping accurate and up-\nto-date records of business transactions and other matters.\nWith the falling cost of computing power, most \nbusinesses, even newly formed ones, keep records on \ncomputer. It is always advisable to keep hold of paper \nrecords too \u00a0\u2013 when these exist \u00a0\u2013 for example, receipts from \nsuppliers or details of big deliveries. Not only can these act \nas a check or back-up system if the computer should fail, but \nthey can also provide evidence to the tax authorities if they \ndispute the entrepreneur\u2019s own tax calculations.\nLack of cash and working capital\nRunning short of capital to run day-to-day business \naff airs is the single most common reason for the failure \nof new businesses to survive the fi rst year of operation.\nCapital is needed for day-to-day cash, for the holding \nof inventories and to allow the giving of trade credit to \ncustomers, who then become trade receivables. Without \nsuffi  cient working capital, the business may be unable \nto buy more supplies, or pay suppliers o ff er credit to \nimportant customers. All these factors could lead to \nthe\u00a0business closing down.\nSerious working capital de fi ciencies can usually be \navoided if several simple, but important, steps are taken \nas\u00a0the business is being established:\n\u25a0 Construct a cash flow forecast so that the liquidity and \nworking capital needs of the business can be assessed \nmonth by month. Keep this updated and also show it to \nthe\u00a0bank manager.\n\u25a0 I n j e c t  s u ff i c i en t  ca p i ta l  i n t o  the  bu s i ness  a t  sta rt -u p  t o  l a st \nfor the first few months of operation when cash flow from \ncustomers may be slow to build up.\n\u25a0 Establish good relations with the bank so that short-term \nproblems may be, at least temporarily, overcome with an \noverdra ft  extension.\u25a0 U s e  e ff ective credit control over customers\u2019 accounts \u00a0\u2013 do \nnot allow a period of credit that is too long, and regularly \nchase up late payers.\nPoor management skills\nMost entrepreneurs have had some form of work \nexperience, but not necessarily at a management level. \nTh ey may not have developed:\n\u25a0 l e a d e r s h i p  s k i l l s\n\u25a0 cash handling and cash management skills\n\u25a0 planning and coordinating skills\n\u25a0 d e c i s i o n - m a k i n g  s k i l l s\n\u25a0 c o m m u n i c a t i o n  s k i l l s\n\u25a0 marketing, promotion and selling skills.\nTh ey may be very keen, willing to work hard and \nhave undoubted abilities in their chosen fi eld, e.g. an \nentrepreneur opening a restaurant may be an excellent \nchef, but may lack management skills. Some learn \nthese skills very quickly once the business is operating, \nbut this is quite a risky strategy. Some organisations \nexist to provide support for new entrepreneurs in the \nform of advice and training. Some entrepreneurs \u2018buy \nin\u2019 experience by employing sta ff  with management \nexperience, but how many newly formed businesses can \naff ord this expensive option?\nIt is wrong to think, just because a business is new and \nsmall, that enthusiasm, a strong personality and hard work \nwill be su ffi  cient to ensure success. Th is may prove to be \nthe case, but o ft en it is not. So potential entrepreneurs \nare usually encouraged to attend training courses to gain \nsome of these skills before putting their hard-earned \ncapital at risk, or to fi rst seek management experience \nthrough employment.\nThe section above introduces some of the important \nfunctions of and skills required by good managers, \nsuggesting why the key concept of management  is so \nimportant.\nKEY CONCEPT LINK\nChanges in the business environment\nSetting up a new business is risky because the business \nenvironment is dynamic, or constantly changing. In \naddition to the problems and challenges referred to above, \nthere is also the risk of change, which can make the \noriginal business idea much less successful. Change is a \nkey feature of Business syllabuses and, therefore, of this \nbook \u00a0\u2013 indeed there is a whole section on change in Unit \u00a06, \nChapter 40 . It is enough to observe at this stage that new \nbusinesses may fail if any of the following changes occur, 91: Enterprise ","66":"\u25a0 Rising incomes associated with higher living standards \nhave led consumers to spend much of their extra income \non services rather than more goods. There has been \nsubstantial growth in tourism, hotels and restaurant \nservices, financial services and so on \u00a0\u2013 yet spending on \nphysical goods is rising more slowly.\n\u25a0 As the rest of the world industrialises, so manufacturing \nbusinesses in developed countries face much more \ncompetition and these rivals tend to be more e ff i c i en t  a nd \nuse cheaper labour. Therefore, rising imports of goods are \ntaking the market away from the domestic secondary-\nsector firms.\n3 The importance of each sector varies significantly \nbetween di ff erent economies. Table 2.1  gives details of the \ndiff erences that exist between three di ff erent countries\u2019 \neconomies and the share of total employment accounted \nfor by each sector of industry.\nPublic and private sectors\nIndustry may also be classi fi ed in other ways, for example by \npublic  or private sector  and by type of legal organisation. \nAs we shall see, these two types of classi fi cation are \ninterlinked, as some types of legal structure are found only \nin the private sector. What is the di ff erence between the \nprivate sector and public sector of the economy?\nPublic sector: comprises organisations accountable \nto and controlled by central or local government \n(the state).\nPrivate sector: comprises businesses owned and \ncontrolled by individuals or groups of individuals.\nKEY TERMS\nIn nearly every country with a mixed economy , most \nbusiness activity is in the private sector. Th e  r e l a t i v e  \nimportance of the private sector compared to the \npublic sector is not the same in all countries. Th o s e  \neconomies that are closest to a free-market  system have \nvery small public sectors. Th ose countries with central \nplanning command economies  will have very few \nbusinesses in the private sector.Command economy: economic resources are owned, \nplanned and controlled by the state.\nKEY TERM\nTh e types and sizes of businesses in the private sector can \nvary considerably. Th e  l e g a l  o r g a n i s a t i o n  o f  fi rms in the \nprivate sector is covered below. In most mixed-economy \ncountries, certain important goods and services are provided \nby state-run organisations as it is argued that they are too \nsigni fi cant to be le ft  to private businesses. Th e s e  u s u a l l y  \ninclude health and education services, defence and public \nlaw and order (police force). In some countries, important \nstrategic industries are also owned and controlled by the \nstate, such as energy, telecommunications and public \ntransport. In recent years, there has been a trend towards \nselling these o ff  to the private sector \u00a0\u2013 privatisation \u00a0\u2013 and the \nimpact of this policy is analysed on page  67.\nAnother re ason for the state or public sector to provide \ngoods or services rather than the private sector is the \nexistence of what economists call \u2018public goods\u2019. Th e s e  \nare goods and services that cannot be charged for, so it is \nimpossible for a private-sector business to make a pro fi t \nfrom producing them. A good example is street lighting. It \nis impossible to exclude people from obtaining the bene fi t \nof the streetlights if they have not contributed to paying for \nthem \u00a0\u2013 so why should anyone contribute directly towards \npaying for them? Th is means that taxes will have to be used \nto raise revenue to pay for a street-lighting system and this \nmeans that it can be provided only by the public sector.\nThe legal structure of business \norganisations \u00a0\u2013 the private sector\nFigure 2.1 on the next page shows the main types of \nprivate sector business.\nSole trader\nTh is is the most common form of business organisation. \nAlthough there is a single owner in this business \norganisation, it is common for sole traders  to employ \nothers, but the fi rm is likely to remain very small. \nBecause of this, although they are great in number, \nsole traders account for only a small proportion of \ntotal business turnover.

When planning to \ngo into partnership, it is important to choose business \npartners carefully \u00a0\u2013 the errors and poor decisions of \nany one partner are considered to be the responsibility \nof them all. Th is also applies to business debts \nincurred by one partner \u00a0\u2013 in most countries there is \nunlimited liability for all partners should the business \nventure fail. In the UK, it is possible to set up limited \nliability partnerships. It is usual, although not a legal \nrequirement, to draw up a formal Deed of Partnership \nbetween all partners.

Th is can discourage \nsome potential entrepreneurs from starting a business. \nAnother signi fi cant problem is fi nance for expansion. \nMany sole traders remain small because the owner \nwishes to remain in control of their own business, \nbut another reason is the limitations that they have \nin raising additional capital. As soon as partners or \nshareholders are sought in order to raise fi nance, then \nthe sole trader becomes another form of organisation \naltogether.

Th ese are:\n1 Limited liability\nTh e ownership of companies is divided into small \nunits called shares. People can buy these and become \nshareholders \u00a0\u2013 part owners of the business. It is possible to \nbuy just one share, but usually these are owned in blocks, \nand it is possible for one person or organisation to have \ncomplete control by owning more than 50% of the shares. \nIndividuals with large blocks of shares o ft en become \ndirectors of the business. All shareholders bene fi t from the \nadvantage of limited liability .\nLimited liability: the only liability \u00a0\u2013 or potential loss \u00a0\u2013 a \nshareholder has if the company fails is the amount invested \nin the company, not the total wealth of the shareholder.\nKEY TERM\nNobody can make any further claim against shareholders, \nshould the company fail. Th is has two important e ff ects:\n\u25a0 People are prepared to provide finance to enable \ncompanies to expand.\n\u25a0 The greater risk of the company failing to pay its debts \nis now transferred from investors to creditors (those \nsuppliers\/lenders who have not been paid). Creditors, \nas a result, are very interested in both checking whether \nthe word \u2018limited\u2019 appears in the business name and scrutinising the company\u2019s accounts for signs of potential \nfuture weakness.\n2 Legal personality\nA company is recognised in law as having a legal \nidentity separate from that of its owners. Th is means, for \nexample, that if the foods sold by a company are found \nto be dangerous or contaminated, the company itself can \nbe taken to court \u00a0\u2013 not the owners, as would be the case \nwith either a sole trader or a partnership. A company can \nbe sued and can itself sue through the courts. Th i s  d o e s  \nnot take all legal responsibilities away from the managers \nand owners. For example, directors can be legally \nresponsible if they knowingly continue trading when \ntheir company is illiquid. Th e y  m u s t  s t i l l  a c t  r e s p o n s i b l y  \nand in accordance with the stated aims of the business \nand within the law.\n3 Continuity\nIn a company, the death of an owner or director \ndoes not lead to its break-up or dissolution. All that \nhappens is that ownership continues through the \ninheritance of the shares, and there is no break in \nownership at all.\nPrivate limited companies\nTh e protection that comes from forming a company is, \ntherefore, substantial. Small fi rms can gain this protection \nwhen the owner(s) create a private limited company .\nPrivate limited company: a small to medium-sized \nbusiness that is owned by shareholders who are o ft en \nmembers of the same family; this company cannot sell \nshares to the general public.\nKEY TERMAdvantages Disadvantages\n\u25a0 partners may specialise in di ff erent areas of business \nmanagement\n\u25a0 shared decision-making\n\u25a0 additional capital injected by each partner\n\u25a0 business losses shared between the partners\n\u25a0 greater privacy and fewer legal formalities than corporate \norganisations (companies)\u25a0 unlimited liability for all partners (with some exceptions)\n\u25a0 profits are shared\n\u25a0 as with sole traders, no continuity and the partnership will \nhave to be reformed in the event of the death of one of the \npartners\n\u25a0 all partners bound by the decisions of any one of them\n\u25a0 not possible to raise capital from selling shares\n\u25a0 a sole trader, taking on partners, will lose independence of \ndecision-making\nTable 2.3 Advantages and disadvantages of partnerships\n192: Business structure ","69":"Th e word \u2018Limited\u2019 or \u2018Ltd\u2019 (\u2018Pte\u2019 in some countries) \ntells us that the business has this legal form.

It is the most common form of legal \norganisation for really large businesses, for the very good \nreason that they have access to very substantial funds for \nexpansion.\nA public limited company  (plc) has all the \nadvantages of private-company status, plus the right \nto advertise their shares for sale and have them quoted \non the stock exchange. Th is not only means that public limited companies can raise potentially very large sums \nfrom public issues of shares, but existing shareholders \nmay also quickly sell their shares if they wish to. Th i s  \nfl exibility of share buying and selling encourages the \npublic to purchase the shares in the fi rst instance and \nthus invest in the business. Th e  o t h e r  m a i n  d i ff erence \nbetween private and public companies concerns the \n\u2018divorce between ownership and control\u2019. As was \nexplained above, the original owners of the business \nare usually still able to retain a majority of shares \nand continue to exercise management control when it \nconverts to private company status. Th is is most unlikely \nwith public limited companies, due to the sheer volume \nof shares issued and number of people and institutions \nas investors. Th ese shareholders own the company, but \nthey appoint, at the annual general meeting, a board of \ndirectors who control the management and decision-\nmaking of the business.\nTh is clear distinction between ownership and control \ncan lead to con fl icts, for example over the objectives to \nbe set and direction to be taken by the business. Th e \nshareholders might prefer measures that aim at short-\nterm pro fi ts, whereas the directors may decide to aim for \nlong-term growth of the business, perhaps in order to \nincrease their own power and status. Many private limited \ncompanies convert to plc status for the reasons given in \nTable \u00a02.5 on page  22. It is possible for the directors or the \noriginal owners of a business to convert it back from a \nplc to private limited company status: Richard Branson \nand the Virgin group is one of the best-known examples. \nTh e reasons for doing this are largely to overcome the \ndivorce between ownership and control \u00a0\u2013 in a private \nlimited company, it is normal for the senior executives \nto be the major, majority shareholders. In addition, the \nowner of a private limited company can take a long-term \nplanning view of the business.

One uses traditional methods of production, using \n108 people to make 300,000 litres of drink a week. Th e \nother is totally automated and produces one million litres \na week with just ten \u00a0staff .\n2 Revenue\nRevenue  is oft en used as a measure of size \u00a0\u2013 especially \nwhen comparing fi rms in the same industry. It is less \neff ective when comparing fi rms in di ff erent industries \nbecause some might be engaged in \u2018high-value\u2019 \nproduction, such as precious jewels, and another might be \nin \u2018low-value\u2019 production, such as cleaning services. Th i s  \nmeasure is needed to calculate market share.\nRevenue: total value of sales made by a business in a \ngiven time period.\nKEY TERM3 Capital employed\nGenerally, the larger the business enterprise, the greater \nthe value of capital needed for long-term investment, \nor the greater the amount of capital employed . Again, \ncomparisons between fi rms in di ff erent industries may \ngive a rather misleading picture. Two fi rms employing \nthe same number of sta ff  may have very di ff erent capital \nequipment needs, such as a hairdresser and an optician. \nTh e latter will need expensive diagnostic and eyesight-\nmeasuring machines.\nCapital employed: the total value of all long-term finance \ninvested in the business.\nKEY TERM\n4 Market capitalisation\nMarket capitalisation  can be used only for businesses that \nhave shares quoted on the stock exchange (public limited \ncompanies). It is calculated by this formula:\nMarket capitalisation =  current share price \u00d7 \ntotal number of shares issued\nMarket capitalisation: the total value of a company\u2019s \nissued shares.\nKEY TERM\nAs share prices tend to change every day, this form of \ncomparison is not a very stable one. For example, a \ntemporary but sharp drop in the share price of a company \ncould appear to make it much \u2018smaller\u2019 than this measure \nwould normally suggest.\n5 Market share\nMarket share  is a relative measure. If a fi rm has a high \nmarket share, it must be among the leaders in the industry \nand comparatively  large. However, when the size of the total \nmarket is small, a high market share will not indicate a very \nlarge fi rm.

Th e  n u m b e r  \nof guest beds or guest rooms could be used to compare \nhotel businesses. Th e number of shops could be used \nfor retailers. Total fl oor sales space could also be used to \ncompare retail businesses.\nTOP TIP\nProfit is not a good measure of business size \u00a0\u2013 but it can \nbe used to assess business performance.\nWhich form of measurement is best?\nTh ere is no \u2018best\u2019 measure. Th e one used depends on what \nneeds to be established about the fi rms being compared. \nTh is could depend on whether we are interested in absolute \nsize or comparative size within one industry. If an absolute \nmeasure of size is required, then it is almost certainly \nadvisable to test a fi rm on at least two of the above criteria \nand to make comparisons on the basis of these.\nTOP TIP\nIf asked to comment on data showing the sizes of \ndiff erent businesses, do remember that if another \nmeasure were used, the conclusions about relative size \nmight be very di ff erent.\nThe significance of small and \nmicro-businesses\nEven though we have not established a universally agreed \ndefi nition of small fi rms, it will be easy to identify them \nwithin your own economy. Th ey will employ few people \nand will have a low turnover compared to other fi rms. \nTh e  offi  cial de fi nition within your own country could be \ndiscovered from the trade and industry department. It is \nnow common to make a further distinction for very small \nbusinesses known as \u2018micro-enterprises\u2019. Th e  E u r o p e a n  \nUnion de fi nitions are shown in  Table 3.1.Small fi rms (including micro-enterprises) are very \nimportant to all economies and to the industry in which \nthey operate. Encouraging the development of small \nbusiness units can have the following bene fi ts:\n\u25a0 Many jobs are created by small firms and, even though each \none may not employ many sta ff , collectively the small-\nbusiness sector employs a very significant proportion of the \nworking population in most countries.\n\u25a0 S m a l l  b u s i n e s s e s  a r e  o ft en ru n b y dyn amic entrepreneu rs, \nwith new ideas for consumer goods and services. This helps \nto create variety in the market and consumers will benefit \nfrom greater choice.\n\u25a0 Small firms can create competition for larger businesses. \nWithout this competition, larger firms could exploit \nconsumers with high prices and poor service. The cost \nof air travel has been reduced in recent years due to the \nestablishment of many small airlines competing with the \nlarge, established companies.\n\u25a0 Small firms o ft en supply specialist goods and \nservices to important industries in a country. For \nexample, the global car industry is dominated by major \nmanufacturers such as Toyota, BMW and Ford. All of \nthese large businesses depend on small specialist \nsuppliers of on-board computers, high-quality audio \nequipment and headlights. Very o ft en, by being able to \nadapt quickly to the changing needs of large firms, small \nbusinesses actually increase the competitiveness of the \nlarger organisations.\n\u25a0 All great businesses were small at one time. The Body Shop \nbegan in one small rented store in 1976. Hewlett-Packard \nstarted assembling electrical equipment in Packard\u2019s \ngarage! The large firms of the future are the small firms \nof today \u00a0\u2013 and the more small firms are encouraged to \nbecome \u00a0established and expand, the greater the chances \nthat an economy will benefit from large-scale organisations \nin the future.\n\u25a0 Small firms may enjoy lower average costs than larger \nones and this benefit could be passed on to the consumer \ntoo. Costs could be lower because wage rates paid to sta ff  \nmay be less than the salaries paid in large organisations, \nor the sheer cost of the administration and management \nstructure of bigger enterprises may increase their costs \ndramatically.\nBusiness category Employees Revenue Capital employed\nMedium 51\u2013250 over \u20ac10m to \u20ac50m over \u20ac10m to \u20ac34m\nSmall 11\u201350 over \u20ac2m to \u20ac10m over \u20ac2m to \u20ac10m\nMicro 10 or fewer up to \u20ac2m up to \u20ac2m\nTable 3.1 EU classifications of business size313: Size of business ","73":"based upon the central aim or mission of the business, but \nthey are expressed in terms that provide a much clearer \nguide for management action or strategy.\nCommon corporate objectives\n1 Profit maximisation\nAll the stakeholders in a business are working for reward. \nProfi ts are essential for rewarding investors in a business \nand for fi nancing further growth. Pro fi ts are necessary \nto persuade business owners \u00a0\u2013 or entrepreneurs \u00a0\u2013 to take \nrisks. But what does \u2018pro fi t maximisation\u2019 really mean? In \nsimple terms, it means producing at that level of output \nwhere the greatest positive di ff erence between total \nrevenue and total costs is achieved.\nTh e chief argument in support of this objective is that it \nseems rational to seek the maximum pro fi t available from \na given venture. Not to maximise pro fi t, according to this \nobjective, is seen as a missed opportunity. However, there \nare serious limitations with this corporate objective:\n\u25a0 The focus on high short-term profits may encourage \ncompetitors to enter the market and jeopardise the long-\nterm survival of the business.\n\u25a0 Many businesses seek to maximise sales in order to secure \nthe greatest possible market share, rather than to maximise \nprofits. The business would expect to make a target rate of \nprofit from these sales.\n\u25a0 The owners of smaller businesses may be more concerned \nwith ensuring that leisure time is safeguarded. The issues \nof independence and retaining control may assume greater \nsignificance than making higher profits.\n\u25a0 Most business analysts assess the performance of a \nbusiness through return on capital employed rather than \nthrough total profit figures.\n\u25a0 Profit maximisation may well be the preferred objective of \nthe owners and shareholders, but other stakeholders will \ngive priority to other issues. Business managers cannot \nignore these. Hence the growing concern over job security \nfor the workforce or the environmental concerns of local \nresidents may force profitable business decisions to be \nmodified, yielding lower profit levels.\n\u25a0 In practice it is very di ff icult to assess whether the point \nof profit maximisation has been reached, and constant \nchanges to prices or output to attempt to achieve it may \nwell lead to negative consumer reactions.\n2 Profit satisficing\nTh is means aiming to achieve enough pro fi t to keep the \nowners happy but not aiming to work fl at out to earn as \nmuch pro fi t as possible. Th is objective is o ft en suggested \nas being common among owners of small businesses who \nwish to live comfortably but do not want to work longer \nand longer hours in order to earn even more pro fi t. Once a satisfactory level of pro fi t has been achieved, the owners \nconsider that other aims take priority \u00a0\u2013 such as more \nleisure time.\n3 Growth\nTh e growth of a business \u00a0\u2013 usually measured in terms \nof sales or value of output \u00a0\u2013 has many potential bene fi ts \nfor the managers and owners. Larger fi rms will be less \nlikely to be taken over and should be able to bene fi t from \neconomies of scale. Managers will be motivated by the \ndesire to see the business achieve its full potential, from \nwhich they may gain higher salaries and fringe bene fi ts. \nIt is also argued that a business that does not attempt to \ngrow will cease to be competitive and, eventually, will lose \nits appeal to new investors. Business objectives based on \ngrowth do have limitations:\n\u25a0 expansion that is too rapid can lead to cash-flow problems\n\u25a0 sales growth might be achieved at the expense of lower \nprofit margins\n\u25a0 larger businesses can experience diseconomies of scale\n\u25a0 u s i n g  p r o f i t s  t o  f i n a n c e  g r o w t h \u00a0\u2013 retained earnings \u00a0\u2013 can \nlead to lower short-term returns to shareholders\n\u25a0 g r o w t h  i n t o  n e w  b u s i n e s s  a r e a s  a n d  a c t i v i t i e s \u00a0\u2013 away from \nthe firm\u2019s core activities \u00a0\u2013 can result in a loss of focus and \ndirection for the whole organisation.\n4 Increasing market share\nClosely linked to overall growth of a business is the market \nshare it enjoys within its main market. Although the two \nare usually related, it is possible for an expanding business \nto su ff er market share reductions if the market is growing \nat a faster rate than the business itself. Increasing market \nshare indicates that the marketing mix of the business is \nproving to be more successful than that of its competitors. \nBene fi ts resulting from having the highest market share \u00a0\u2013 \nbeing the brand leader \u00a0\u2013 include:\n\u25a0 retailers will be keen to stock and promote the best-selling \nbrand\n\u25a0 p r o f i t  m a r g i n s  o ff ered to retailers may be lower than \ncompeting brands as the shops are so keen to stock it \u00a0\u2013 this \nleaves more profit for the producer\n\u25a0 eff ective promotional campaigns are o ft en based on \u2018buy \nour product with confidence \u00a0\u2013 it is the brand leader\u2019.\n5 Survival\nTh is is likely to be the key objective of most new business \nstart-ups. Th e high failure rate of new businesses means \nthat to survive for the fi rst two years of trading is an \nimportant aim for entrepreneurs. Once the business \nhas become fi rmly established, then other longer-term \nobjectives can be established.42Cambridge International AS and A Level Business","74":"Reuters achieving its aims\nReuters, one of the world\u2019s largest news agencies, \nhas returned to profitability after several years of \nlosses. It aims to increase value for shareholders, \nand the fact that Reuters\u2019s shares have risen 7% \nfaster than average share prices suggests that \nthe company is becoming increasingly successful. \nProfits are being made for two main reasons. \nMany jobs have been lost in the company in recent \nyears as a result of the chief executive\u2019s policy \nof cutting costs. Secondly, an ambitious growth \nobjective has been established to increase sales \nand this target is being reached. New products \n(such as electronic trading) and new markets \n(such as China, Russia and India) have allowed \nan increase in sales of over 6% this year. This \nis above the growth target that was set.

However, if \nincreased sales are achieved by reducing prices, the actual \nprofi ts of the business might fall.\n8 Maximising shareholder value\nTh is could apply to public limited companies and directs \nmanagement action towards taking decisions that would \nincrease the company share price and dividends paid to \nshareholders. Th ese targets might be achieved by pursuing \nthe goal of pro fi t maximisation. Th i s  s h a r e h o l d e r - v a l u e  \nobjective puts the interests of shareholders above those \nof other stakeholders. Chapter 5 considers the potential \nconfl ict between this objective and the aims of other \nstakeholder groups.6 Corporate social responsibility (CSR)\nShould fi rms have objectives about social, environmental \nand ethical issues? Increasingly, there is general agreement \nthat fi rms must adopt a wider perspective when setting \ntheir objectives and not just be aiming for pro fi ts or \nexpansion. One reason for this is the much greater adverse \npublicity given to business activity that is perceived as \nbeing damaging to stakeholder groups and the wider \nworld. Increasingly, in fl uential pressure groups are forcing \nbusinesses to reconsider their approach to decision-\nmaking. Also, legal changes \u00a0\u2013 at the local, national and \nEU level \u00a0\u2013 have forced businesses to refrain from certain \npractices. Firms can no longer pay sta ff  very low wages \nor avoid legal responsibility for their products. Managers \nclearly wish to avoid con fl icts with the law or bad publicity.\nCorporate social responsibility: this concept applies to \nthose businesses that consider the interests of society by \ntaking responsibility for the impact of their decisions and \nactivities on customers, employees, communities and the \nenvironment.\nKEY TERM\nTh ere are other reasons for these trends in business \nobjectives \u00a0\u2013 increasingly, consumers and other \nstakeholders are reacting positively to businesses that act \nin \u2018green\u2019 or socially responsible ways. Examples include:\n\u25a0 Firms that promote organic and vegetarian foods.\n\u25a0 Retailers that advertise the proportion of their products \nmade from recycled materials.\n\u25a0 Businesses that refuse to stock goods that have been \ntested on animals or foods based on genetically modified \ningredients.\nIn these cases, is the action being taken because trade and \nreputation might be lost if it is not or because such action \nis increasingly pro fi table? Might businesses be criticised \nfor \u2018jumping on the corporate social responsibility \nbandwagon\u2019 rather than praised for their genuine concern \nfor society and the environment? Conceivably, fi rms are \nbeing ethical or environmentally conscious because they \nhave an objective that Peter Drucker, a famous writer \non management, calls \u2018public responsibility\u2019, because \nthey want to behave in these ways. Many consumer \ngroups and pressure groups are still dubious as to \nwhether these objectives are based on genuinely held \nbeliefs or not. Chapter 5  discusses the impact of social \nand environmental pressures on business and business \nstakeholders in more detail.434: Business objectives ","75":"Objectives and decision-making\nEff ective decision-making requires clear objectives. \nBusiness managers cannot decide on future plans \nof action \u00a0\u2013 strategies \u00a0\u2013 if they are uncertain of \nwhich direction they want to take the business in. \nTh is essential link between decisions and objectives is \nillustrated in the decision making framework model \nshown in  Figure 4.4.\nTh e stages in this decision making framework are:\n1 S e t  o b j e c t i v e s .\n2 A s s e s s  t h e  p r o b l e m  o r  s i t u a t i o n .\n3 Gather data about the problem and possible solutions.\n4 C o n s i d e r  a l l  d e c i s i o n  o p t i o n s .\n5 M a k e  t h e  s t r a t e g i c  d e c i s i o n .\n6 Plan and implement the decision.\n7 R e v i e w  i t s  s u c c e s s  a g a i n s t  t h e  o r i g i n a l  o b j e c t i v e s .\nClearly, without setting relevant objectives at the start of \nthis process, e ff ective decision-making for the future of the \nbusiness becomes impossible.\nHow corporate objectives might change\nTh ere are many examples of businesses changing their \ncorporate objectives over time. Th ese are some of the \nreasons for this:\n1 A  n e w l y  f o r m e d  b u s i n e s s  m a y  h a v e  s a t i s f i e d  t h e  \u2018 s u r v i v a l \u2019  \nobjective by operating for several years, and now the owners \nwish to pursue objectives of growth or increased profit.2 T h e  c o m p e t i t i v e  a n d  e c o n o m i c  e n v i r o n m e n t  m a y  c h a n g e ,  \nso the entry into the market of a powerful rival or the start \nof an economic recession may lead a firm to switch from \ngrowth to survival as its main aim \u00a0\u2013 or even just to revise its \nobjectives for sales and profits downwards.\n3 A short-term objective of growth in sales or market share \nmight be adapted to a longer-term objective of maximising \nprofits from the higher level of sales.\nFactors that determine the corporate \nobjectives of a business\nCorporate culture\nClearly, not all businesses pursue the same objectives. \nTh ere are several factors that in fl uence the nature of the \nobjectives established for any business. Chief among these \nis the culture of the organisation. Th is can be de fi ned \nas the code of behaviour and attitudes that in fl uence \nthe decision-making style of the managers and other \nemployees of the business. Culture is a way of doing things \nthat is shared by all those in the organisation. Culture is \nabout people, how they perform and deal with others, how \naggressive they are in the pursuit of objectives and how \nadaptable they are in the face of change. If directors are \naggressive in pursuit of their aims, are keen to take over \nor defeat rival businesses and care little about social or \nenvironmental factors, then the objectives of the business \nwill be very di ff erent to those of a business owned and \ncontrolled by directors with a more people- or social-\noriented culture.\nThe size and legal form of the business\nOwners of small businesses may be concerned only with \na satisfactory level of pro fi t\u00a0\u2013 called \u2018satis fi cing\u2019. Larger \nbusinesses, perhaps controlled by directors rather than \nowners, such as most public limited companies, might \nbe more concerned with rapid business growth in order \nto increase the status and power of the managers. Th i s  \nis oft en a result of a development known as the \u2018divorce \nbetween ownership and control\u2019, which nearly always \nexists in large companies with professional directors \nwho do not own it. Th ey may be more concerned about \ntheir bonuses, salaries and fringe bene fi ts\u00a0\u2013 which o ft en \ndepend on business size \u00a0\u2013 than on maximising returns to \nshareholders.\nPublic-sector or private-sector businesses\nState-owned organisations tend not to have profit as a \nmajor objective. The aims of these organisations can \nvary greatly, but when the service they provide is not \ncharged for, such as education and health services, \nthen a financial target would be inappropriate.

However, they eliminate supporting body \nlanguage, do not allow for immediate feedback and there is \noft en no evidence that the message has been received and\/or \nunderstood.\nIT and web-based media (electronic media)\nTh ese have the bene fi t of speed and are o ft en combined \nwith a written record. Internet and email use, Intranets \n(internal computer links), fax messages, video\/web-\nconferencing and smartphones, including the use of social \nmedia, have all revolutionised business communications \nin recent years. Th ese applications of electronic media do \nhave their drawbacks:\n\u25a0 They may require sta ff  to be trained and the young are \nusually much more proficient in their use than older \nemployees.\n\u25a0 They reduce social contact and can create a sense of \nisolation and an important social need may go unsatisfied. \nEmployees may use company time to send personal \nmessages.\n\u25a0 Direct interpersonal contact is lost and most of these \nmedia do not allow the use of body language to help convey \nmessages.\n\u25a0 There are security issues with computer technology and \nhard copies of important messages are o ft en kept too in \ncase of a virus.\n\u25a0 Finally, there is increasing evidence that IT can lead to \ninformation overload  as a result of the speed and low \nusage cost of these methods. Too many messages can \nprevent the really important communication from being \nnoticed and acted upon. For example, the sheer volume \nof email messages can take some workers several hours \nto reply to each day. Too much information can also cause stress and a feeling of overwork. The benefits o ff ered by IT \nand other electronic methods have to be weighed against \ntheir actual cost \u00a0\u2013 in terms of equipment and training \u00a0\u2013 \nand their other potential drawbacks.\nTh e strengths and weaknesses of communication methods \nare summarised in Table 15.1.\nInformation overload: so much information and so \nmany messages are received that the most important ones \ncannot be easily identified and quickly acted on \u00a0\u2013 most \nlikely to occur with electronic media.\nKEY TERM\nVisual communication\nTh is can be used to accompany and support oral, written \nor electronic communication. Diagrams, pictures, charts \nand pages of computer images can be presented by using \noverhead projection, interactive white boards, data projectors, \ndownloads and other means. Th e impact is increased if \ncolour and movement are used. Th is form of communication \nis particularly useful in training or in marketing.\nFactors influencing choice of \nappropriate media\nManagers will consider these factors before deciding on \nthe best communication method:\n\u25a0 The importance of a written record that the message has \nbeen sent and received, for example an important new legal \ncontract.\n\u25a0 The advantages to be gained from sta ff  input or two-way \ncommunication, for example a new sta ff  shi ft  syst e m  p r o po sa l \ncould be discussed with workers before implementation.\n\u25a0 Cost \u00a0\u2013 electronic media o ft en  req u i re  expen s iv e  ca p i ta l \nresources, but, once these are obtained, emails are cost-\neff ective. Written memos are cheap, but how many people \nwill see them? The cost of management time in meetings \nshould not be overlooked \u00a0\u2013 it would be quicker and cheaper, \nbut much less e ff ective, to email all those at the meeting \ninstead.\n\u25a0 Speed \u00a0\u2013 electronic means can be quick, but is this more \nimportant than allowing time for opinions to be discussed \nat a meeting?\n\u25a0 Quantity of data to be communicated \u00a0\u2013 the longer and \nmore detailed the message, the less likely it is that oral \ncommunication will be adequate.\n\u25a0 Whether more than one method should be used for clarity \nand to be sure that the message has been received \u00a0\u2013 a quick \ntelephone call followed up by an o ff icial letter or order form \nwill achieve both speed and accuracy.\n\u25a0 Size and geographical spread of the business \u00a0\u2013 regular and \nfrequent meetings of senior regional managers may be \nimpossible in a multinational business.202Cambridge International AS and A Level Business","79":"Another de fi nition comes from Contemporary Marketing \nWired , by Boone and Kurtz:\nMarketing is the process of planning and undertaking \nthe conception, pricing, promotion and distribution of \ngoods and services to create and maintain relationships \nthat will satisfy individual and organisational objectives.\nIt seems from this de fi nition that marketing involves a \nnumber of related management functions. Th e s e  i n c l u d e :\n\u25a0 market research\n\u25a0 product design\n\u25a0 pricing\n\u25a0 advertising\n\u25a0 distribution\n\u25a0 customer service\n\u25a0 packaging.\nSo, marketing is a very important business activity. To \nsum up, marketing activities are all those associated \nwith identifying the particular wants and needs of \ntarget-market customers and then trying to satisfy those \ncustomer needs better than your competitors do. Th i s  \nmeans that market research is needed to identify and \nanalyse customer needs. With this knowledge, strategic \ndecisions must then be taken about product design, \npricing, promotion and distribution.\nTh is is the de fi nition of marketing that you should keep \nin mind during your study of the next few chapters.\nRelated concepts\nMarkets\nTh is term is vital to achieve an understanding of marketing. \nIt has two rather di ff erent meanings. Perhaps the most \nobvious meaning is the \u2018place or mechanism where buyers \nand sellers meet to engage in exchange\u2019 . Th e weekly fruit \nand vegetable market would be one example of this. \nShopping centres and auctions are other examples of \nmarkets. Increasingly, there is no physical place in the \nsense of a geographical location. Th e use of the internet \nas a marketing tool has meant that a market can exist \nelectronically with no physical meeting between buyer \nand\u00a0seller.\nTh e  t e r m  market  also refers to the group of consumers \nthat is interested in a product, has the resources to purchase the product and is permitted by law to purchase it. It can \nbe broken down into di ff erent de fi nitions. For example, \nthe potential market for a product is the total population \ninterested in the product. Th e  t a r g e t  m a r k e t  i s  t h e  s e g m e n t  \nof the available market that the business has decided to \nserve by directing its product towards this group of people.\nHuman needs and wants\nA human need is a basic requirement that an individual \nwishes to satisfy. Physical needs include food, clothing and \nshelter. Individual needs include desires for knowledge, \nrecognition, a ff ection, self-esteem and self-expression, e.g. \nthrough the clothes people wear.\nWants are broader in their perspective. Th ey are things \nwe do not need for our survival as biological creatures, but \nthey do satisfy certain requirements or individual needs \nof most human beings. So we need food to physically \nsurvive, but, although we may want a juicy steak or fresh \ncrab, we do not need these particular expensive items of \nfood to survive. Th ey may, however, satisfy an individual \nneed, such as being seen in an expensive restaurant. We \nneed shelter to protect us from the elements \u2013 but our \ndesire for a house by the beach is a \u2018want\u2019, not an essential \nrequirement for survival.\nWants are o ft en described as being goods and services \nthat ful fi l the needs of individual consumers. Many \nmarketing managers believe that it is their aim to convert \nhuman needs into wants by very persuasive product \nimagery through advertising.\nValue and satisfaction\nDo cheap goods always o ff er good value? Do expensive \ngoods always provide consumer satisfaction? Clearly, the \nanswer to both of these questions is \u2018no\u2019. Value is not the \nsame as cheapness. A consumer will consider a product \nto be of good value if it provides satisfaction at what is \nthought to be a reasonable price. Customer satisfaction \nis not always obtained with very expensive products \u2013 a \ngood might be so expensive that, although it performs its \nfunction well, the consumer believes that \u2018good value\u2019 has \nnot been received.\nTwo examples will help to support these points:\n1 A consumer who is very hungry may be looking to eat in a \ntop-class restaurant. If none is open, and he decides to eat \nin a pizza caf\u00e9, the meal may be not as good as in a top-class \nrestaurant but because it is much cheaper, it might still \nprovide value  and, therefore, customer satisfaction.\n2 A very expensive car may perform well, but once it is \npurchased the consumer may have a sense of disappointment \nif he feels that it is actually too expensive for \u2018what it o ff ers \u2019 . \nThere will be no sense of good value and no long-term \nconsumer satisfaction.Marketing : the management task that links the business \nto the customer by identifying and meeting the needs \nof customers profitably \u2013 it does this by getting the right \nproduct at the right price to the right place at the right time.\nKEY TERM\n214Cambridge International AS and A Level Business","80":"and allocating costs to each product is not usually very \nstraightforward in a business with more than one product. \nSome costing methods require this allocation to be made, \nsome do not.\nBefore we can begin to use cost data to assist in making \nimportant decisions, it is important to understand the di ff erent \ncost classi fi cations.

Th e most important \ndirect cost in a service business, such as retailing, is the \ncost of the goods being sold.\nIndirect costs\nIndirect costs are o ft en referred to as overheads. \nExamples are:\n\u25a0 One indirect cost to a farm is the purchase of a tractor.\n\u25a0 One indirect cost to a supermarket is its promotional \nexpenditure.\n\u25a0 One indirect cost to a garage is the rent.\n\u25a0 One indirect cost of running a school is the cost of cleaning it.\nIndirect costs: costs that cannot be identified with a unit \nof production or allocated accurately to a cost centre.\nKEY TERM\nHow are costs a ff ected by the level \nof output?\nIt is important for management to understand that not all \ncosts will vary directly in line with production increases \nor decreases. In the short run \u2212 the period in which no changes to capacity can be made \u2212 costs may be classi fi ed \nas follows:\n\u25a0 Fixed costs:  These remain fixed no matter what the level of \noutput, such as rent of premises.\n\u25a0 Variable costs : These vary as output changes, such as the \ndirect cost of materials used in making a washing machine \nor the electricity used to cook a fast-food meal. Semi-\nvariable costs include both a fixed and a variable element, \nfor example the electricity standing charge plus cost per \nunit used, salesperson\u2019s fixed basic wage plus a commission \nthat varies with sales.\n\u25a0 Marginal costs:  These are the additional costs of producing \none more unit of output, and will be the extra variable \ncosts needed to make this extra unit. So the marginal \ncosts involved in making one more wooden table are the \nadditional costs of wood, glue and screws plus the labour \ncosts incurred.\nFixed costs: costs that do not vary with output in the \nshort run.\nVariable costs: costs that vary with output.\nMarginal costs: the extra cost of producing one more \nunit of output.\nKEY TERMS\nTypes of costs\n[18 marks, 20 minutes]\n1 Identify one  indirect cost for each of these \nbusinesses:\na a construction company\nb a high-street bank\nc a TV repairing business\nd an oil-fired power station.

In practice, it may not be very easy or \neven worthwhile to classify every cost into the categories \nexplained above:\n\u25a0 Are labour costs necessarily vari able, direct costs? Certainly \nnot, because when labour is unoccupied because of a lack \nof orders, most businesses will continue to employ and pay \nworkers in the short run. Wages then become an overhead \ncost, which cannot be directly allocated to any particular \noutput. Similarly a television presenter may be employed on a \nfixed-contract salary, which will not be related to the amount \nof work done. In addition, the salaries of administration, selling \nand other sta ff  are always considered to be an indirect cost, \nprobably fixed in the short run, because these costs cannot be \nidentified with any one of the firm\u2019s products or services.\n\u25a0 Telephone charges in a busy factor y could be directly allocated \nto each range of products made, as long as an accurate and \nreliable record was kept of the purpose of each call. In practice, \nthis may not be worthwhile and telephone charges would \nnormally be considered as an indirect overhead expense.\nTOP TIP\nNot all direct costs are variable costs. For example, if a \nhotel buys a new juicing machine for the bar department, \nthis is a direct cost to that department \u00a0\u2013 but the cost of \nthe machine will not vary with the number of orange \njuices being served.\nBreak-even analysis\nTh is form of analysis is widely used in business as it \nprovides useful information for decision-making.Break-even point of production: the level of output at \nwhich total costs equal total revenue,  neither a profit nor a \nloss is made.\nKEY TERM\nBreak-even analysis can be undertaken in two ways:\n1 the graphical method\n2 t h e  e q u a t i o n  m e t h o d .\nThe graphical method \u00a0\u2013 the break-even chart\nTh e break-even chart requires a graph with the axes shown \nin Figure 29.1. Th e chart itself is usually drawn showing \nthree piec es of information:\n1 Fixed costs , which, in the short term, will not vary with the \nlevel of output and which must be paid whether the firm \nproduces anything or not.\n2 Total costs , which are the addition of fixed and variable \ncosts; we will assume, initially at least, that variable costs \nvary in direct proportion to output.\n3 Sales revenue , obtained by multiplying selling price by \noutput level.\nFigure 29.2 shows a typical break-even chart. Note carefully \nthe following points:\n\u25a0 The fixed-cost line is horizontal, showing that fixed costs are \nconstant at all output levels.\n\u25a0 Sales revenue starts at the origin (0) because if no sales are \nmade, there can be no revenue.\n\u25a0 The variable-cost line starts from the origin (0) because if no \ngoods are produced, there will be no variable costs. It is drawn \nto aid your understanding of how the chart is constructed. It is \nnot necessary to interpret the chart and is o ft en  om i tt ed.\n\u25a0 The total-cost line begins at the level of fixed costs, the \ndiff erence between total and fixed costs being accounted \nfor by variable costs.\nFigure 29.1 The axes for a break-even chart0 Costs and sales revenue ($)\nUnits of output\nOil-fired power station in Cyprus \u00a0\u2013 indirect costs are a very \nhigh proportion of total costs in electricity generation\n436Cambridge International AS and A Level Business","82":"0 Costs and sales revenue ($)\nUnits of output\nand salesBreak-even pointProfit at full\ncapacity\nVariable\ncosts\nFixed costsBE}Sales revenue\nTotal costs\nFull\ncapacityFigure 29.2 A typical break-even chartMargin of safety\nTh is is a useful indication of how much sales could fall \nwithout the fi rm falling into loss.

Strategic analysis is aided by a \nnumber of di ff erent techniques and the rest of this chapter \nfocuses on these.\nSWOT analysis\nA SWOT analysis  provides information that can be \nhelpful in matching the fi rm\u2019s resources and strengths \nto\u00a0the competitive environment in which it operates. It is, therefore, useful in strategy formulation and \nselection. It comprises:\nStrengths:  These are the internal factors about a business that \ncan be looked upon as real advantages. These could be used \nas a basis for developing a competitive advantage. They might \ninclude: experienced management, product patents, loyal \nworkforce and good product range. These factors are identified \nby undertaking an internal audit of the firm. This is o ft en \nundertaken by specialist management consultants who analyse \nthe e ff ectiveness of the business and the e ff ectiveness of each \nof its departments and major product ranges.\nWeaknesses:  These are the internal factors about a business \nthat can be seen as negative factors. In some cases, these \ncan be the flip side of strengths. For example, whereas a \nlarge amount of spare manufacturing capacity might be a \nstrength in times of a rapid economic upturn, if it continues to \nbe unused then it could add substantially to a firm\u2019s average \ncosts of production. Weaknesses might include: poorly trained \nworkforce, limited production capacity and ageing equipment. \nThis information would also have been obtained from an \ninternal audit.\nOpportunities:  These are the potential areas for expansion \nof the business and future profits. These factors are identified \nby an external audit of the market the firm operates in and its \nmajor competitors. Examples include: new technologies, export \nmarkets expanding faster than domestic markets, and lower \nrates of interest increasing consumer demand.\nThreats:  These are also external factors gained from \nan external audit. This audit analyses the business and \neconomic environment, market conditions and the strength \nof competitors. Examples of threats are: new competitors \nentering the market, globalisation driving down prices, changes \nin the law regarding the sale of the firm\u2019s products, and changes \nin government economic policy.\nTh is information is usually presented in the form of a four-\nbox grid as shown in Table 38.1.\nSWOT and strategic objectives\nTh e SWOT diagram focuses on the key issues under \neach heading. A brief outline of each of these could then \naccompany the grid to make it more useful to the managers \nresponsible for strategic planning. Th i s  a p p r o a c h  h e l p s  \nmanagers assess the most likely successful future strategies \nand the constraints on them. A business should not \nnecessarily pursue the most pro fi table opportunities. It may \nstand a better chance of developing a competitive advantage \nby identifying a good \u2018 fi t\u2019 between the fi rm\u2019s strengths and \npotential opportunities. In many cases, a business may \nneed to overcome a perceived weakness in order to take \nadvantage of a potential opportunity. SWOT is a common \nstarting point for developing new corporate strategies, but \nit is rarely su ffi  cient. Further analysis and planning are \nusually needed before strategic choices can be made.SWOT analysis: a form of strategic analysis that identifies \nand analyses the main internal strengths and weaknesses \nand external opportunities and threats that will influence \nthe future direction and success of a business.\nKEY TERM544Cambridge International AS and A Level Business","87":"5 1A.1 THE CHEMISTRY OF LIFE CHEMISTRY FOR BIOLOGISTS\n \u2022Co valent bonding: the atoms involved in the reaction share electrons (see fig D).

Biological molecules are often organic compounds. Organic compounds all contain carbon atoms. They also contain atoms of  hydrogen, oxygen and, less frequently, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus. Most of  the material in your body that is not water consists of  these organic molecules. An understanding of  why organic molecules are special will help you to understand the chemistry of  biological molecules including carbohydrates, lipids and proteins.\nEach carbon atom can make four bonds and so it can connect \nto four other atoms. Carbon atoms bond particularly strongly to other carbon atoms to make long chains. The four bonds of  a carbon atom usually form a tetrahedral shape. This means carbon compounds can be rings, branched chains or any number of  three-dimensional (3D) shapes (see fig A). In some carbon compounds small molecules (monomers) bond with many other similar units to make a very large molecule called a polymer. The ability of  carbon to combine and make macromolecules (large molecules) is the basis of  all biological molecules and provides the great variety and complexity found in living things.\nThese two bonds\nare in the plane\nof the paper.\nor more often as:C This bond goesback behind the\nplane of the paper.\nThis bond sticks out ofthe plane of the paper.\ncan be shown with corners representing carbons, and itshydrogens ignored:\nH\nCC\nHHCC\nHH\nHH\nHHC\nHC\nHHCC\nC\nHHC\nHHHH HH\nThis part \nof a chain molecule:\n\u25b2 fig A  T he bonds in a carbon atom have a complicated 3D shape.

They are also important for storing energy and they form an important part of  the cell wall in plants, fungi and bacteria. Sugars and starch are the best known carbohydrates. Sucrose is the familiar white crystalline table sugar; glucose is used as a fuel by the cells of  our bodies. Starch is in rice, flour and potatoes. But the group of  substances called carbohydrates contains many more compounds, as you will discover.\n\u25b2 fig B  Carbohydr ates are important molecules in both plants and animals \n\u2013 and carbohydrate foods like this bread play a major role in the human \ndiet.\nThe basic structure of  all carbohydrates is the same. They consist \nof  carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. There are three main groups of  carbohydrates: monosaccharides, disaccharides and \npolysaccharides. Some have more complex molecules than others (see Section 1A.3).\nMONOSACCHARIDES: THE SIMPLE SUGARS \nMonosaccharides are simple sugars in which there is one oxygen \natom and two hydrogen atoms for each carbon atom in the molecule. A general formula for this can be written (CH\n2O)n. Here \nn can be any number, but it is usually low.\nTriose sugars (n = 3) have three carbon atoms and the general \nformula C3H6O3. They are important in mitochondria, where the \nrespiration process breaks down glucose into triose sugars (see Book 2 Chapter 7A).1A1.4 CP1 1.3 1.2(ii) 1.2(i)\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

They are made of  many monosaccharide units \njoined by condensation reactions that create glycosidic bonds (see Section\u00a01A.2 fig E). Polysaccharides \ndo not have the sweet taste of  many mono- and disaccharides, but these complex polymers include some very important biological molecules.\nMolecules with between 3 and 10 sugar units are known as oligosaccharides, while molecules \ncontaining 11 or more monosaccharides are known as true polysaccharides. The glycosidic bonds in the polysaccharide can be broken to release monosaccharide units for cellular respiration.\nThe glycosidic bond between two glucose units is split by a process known as hydrolysis (see fig\u00a0A).  \nThe hydrolysis reaction is the opposite of  the condensation reaction that created the molecule, so water \nis added to the bond. Starch and glycogen are gradually broken down into shorter and shorter chains and eventually single sugars are left. Disaccharides break down to form two monosaccharides. Hydrolysis takes place during digestion in the gut, and also in the muscle and liver cells when the carbohydrate stores are broken down to release sugars for use in cellular respiration (see Book 2 Chapter 7A).\nH\nHOH\nOHO\n1 46\n2 35\n1,4-glycosidic bondH\nHO OHH O\n1 4\n2 356\nH\nHOH O\n1 4\n2 356H\nOOHH O\n1 4\n2 356\nmaltosecondensation hydrolysis\nH2O H2O\u03b1-glucose \u03b1-glucose\n\u25b2 fig A  Gly cosidic bonds are made by condensation reactions and broken down by hydrolysis.\nCARBOHYDRATES AND ENERGY \nMONOSACCHARIDES AND DISACCHARIDES\nEvery chemical reaction taking place in a cell needs energy. This energy is supplied by a substance \ncalled adenosine triphosphate, ATP . This ATP comes from the breakdown of  the monosaccharide \nglucose, using oxygen, in the process of  cellular respiration. Y ou will learn much more about cellular respiration later in your course in Book 2 Chapter 7A. \nThe arrangement of  atoms in a molecule of  \u03b1-glucose means that it can be broken down completely \nin a series of  reactions, if  oxygen is available. The compounds that are produced, called the end products, are waste carbon dioxide and water, and lots of  ATP . This supplies the energy needed for all the reactions in the cell. LEARNING TIP\nGlycosidic bonds are formed \nwith the removal of a molecule of water in condensation reactions. \nGlycosidic bonds are broken \nwith the addition of a molecule of water in hydrolysis reactions.\nEXAM HINT\nBe careful not to say that this produces or creates energy for cell processes. Energy cannot be created \u2013 it is converted from one form to another. Here, chemical energy is transferred from the glucose molecule to the ATP molecules.LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n \u25fcKnow the diff erence between monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides, including glycogen and starch.\n \u25fcExplain how monosaccharides join to f\norm polysaccharides through condensation reactions forming glycosidic \nbonds, and how these can be split through hydrolysis reactions.\n \u25fcR\nelate the structures of monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides to their roles in providing and  \nstoring energy.1.4 CP1 1.3 1.2(ii) 1.2(i)\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Other monosaccharides and disaccharides \u2013 for example, fructose, maltose and sucrose \u2013 are also easily absorbed in the body and rapidly converted to glucose. So foods containing monosaccharides and disaccharides are a good source of  relatively instant energy (see fig B). However, these cannot be used to store energy because they are chemically active, and they are very soluble in water, so they affect the water balance of  the cells. Y ou will find out why that is so important in Chapter 2A.\n\u25b2 fig B  T hese medjool dates contain a lot of fructose. That is why they taste \nso sweet and give you instant energy.\nPOLYSACCHARIDES\nThe structure of  polysaccharides makes them ideal as energy \nstorage molecules within a cell.\n \u2022T\nhey can form very compact molecules, which take up little space.\n \u2022T\nhey are physically and chemically inactive, so they do not \ninterfere with the other functions of  the cell.\n \u2022T\nhey are not very soluble in water, so have almost no  \neffect on water potential within a cell and cause no  osmotic water movements.\nSTARCH\nStarch is particularly important as an energy store in plants. The sugars produced by photosynthesis are rapidly converted into starch, which is insoluble and compact but can be broken down rapidly to release glucose when it is needed. Storage organs such as sweet potatoes (yams) are particularly rich in starch. Y ou will find out a lot more about the importance of  starch in plants in Chapter 4A of  this book.\nStarch consists of  long chains of  \u03b1-glucose. But if  you look at it \nmore closely you will see that it is a mixture of  two compounds:\n \u2022Amylose\n: an unbranched polymer of  between 200 and 5000 \nglucose units. As the chain lengthens the molecule spirals, which makes it more compact for storage.\n \u2022Amylopectin\n: a branched polymer of  glucose units. The \nbranching chains have many terminal glucose units that can be broken off  rapidly when energy is needed.\nAmylose and amylopectin are both long chains of  \u03b1-glucose units \u2013 so why are the molecules so different? It all depends on the carbon atoms involved in the glycosidic bonds.\nAmylose has only 1,4-glycosidic bonds, which is why the \nmolecules are long unbranched\u00a0chains.\nIn amylopectin, many of  the glucose molecules are joined by \n1,4-glycosidic bonds, but there are also a few 1,6-glycosidic bonds. This results in the branching chains that change the properties of  the molecule.EXAM HINT\nBe sure you can relate the structure of the molecule to its function as \na storage molecule.\nCoiling makes it compact so it takes up less space and doesn\u2019t get in \nthe way of organelles or substances moving around the cell.\nLarge molecules are insoluble so they do not interfere with the water \npotential of the cell.\nPRACTICAL SKILLS CP1\nTesting for starch\nIf you add a few drops of reddish-brown iodine solution to a sample \ncontaining starch (whether it is a solid sample or a sample in solution), the iodine solution will turn blue-black (see fig C).\nStarch has a combination of  straight-chain amylose and branched-\nchain amylopectin molecules (see fig D). This combination explains why carbohydrate foods like rice and pasta are so good for you when you are doing sport or hard physical work.

Like starch, it is very compact, but the glycogen molecule has more 1,6-glycosidic bonds than the starch molecule, giving it many side branches.

They are an \nintegral part of  all cell membranes and are also used as an energy store. Lipids contain many carbon\u2013\nhydrogen bonds and almost no oxygen. When lipids are oxidised in the respiration process, the bonds are broken and carbon dioxide and water are the final products. This reaction can be used to drive the production of  much ATP (see Sections 1A.3, 2A.2 and 2A.4 and Book 2 Chapter 5A). Lipids, \nespecially triglycerides, store about three times as much energy as the same mass of  carbohydrates. Many plants and animals convert spare food into oils or fats as an energy store to use when needed. For example, the seeds of  plants contain lipids to provide energy for the seedling when it starts to grow, which is why seeds are such an important food source for many animals.\nFATS AND OILS\nFats and oils are important groups of  lipids. Chemically they are very similar, but fats such as butter are solids at room temperature whereas oils such as olive oil are liquids (see fig A). Fats come mainly from animal sources while oils are mainly from plant sources.\nLike carbohydrates, the chemical elements that all lipid molecules contain are carbon, hydrogen and \noxygen. However, lipids contain a much lower proportion of  oxygen than carbohydrates. Fats and oils contain two types of  organic chemical substance, fatty acids and glycerol (propane-1,2,3-triol). These are combined using ester bonds. Glycerol has the chemical formula C\n3H8O3 (see fig B).\nAll fatty acids have a long hydrocarbon chain \u2013 a folded backbone of  carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms attached, and a carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) at one end. Living tissues contain more than 70 different types of  fatty acid. Fatty acids vary in two ways:\n \u2022the length of\n the carbon chain can differ (but is often 15\u201317 carbon atoms long)\n \u2022the f\natty acid may be a saturated fatty acid or an unsaturated fatty acid.\nIn a saturated fatty acid, each carbon atom is joined to the one next to it by a single covalent bond. A common example is stearic acid (see fig C). In an unsaturated fatty acid, the carbon chains have one or more double covalent bonds between carbon atoms in them.

Proteins make \nhair, skin and nails, the enzymes needed for metabolism and digestion, and many of  the hormones that control the different body systems. They enable muscle fibres to contract, make antibodies that protect you from disease, help clot your blood and transport oxygen in the form of  haemoglobin. Understanding the structure of  proteins helps you understand the detailed biology of  cells and organisms. Like carbohydrates and lipids, proteins contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. In addition, they all contain nitrogen and many proteins also contain sulfur.\nProteins are a group of  macromolecules made up of  many \nsmall monomer units called amino acids joined together by condensation reactions. Amino acids combine in long chains to produce proteins. There are about 20 different naturally occurring amino acids that can combine in different ways to produce a wide range of  different proteins.\nAMINO ACIDS\nAll amino acids have the same basic structure, which is represented as a general formula. There is always an amino group (\u2013NH\n2) and a carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) attached to a carbon \natom (see fig A). The group known as the R group varies between amino acids. Some amino acids contain sulfur and selenium in their R group. The R groups are not involved in the reactions which join the amino acids together, but the structure of  the R group does affect the way the amino acid interacts with others within the protein molecule. This will mainly depend on whether the R\u00a0group is polar or not, and these interactions affect the tertiary structure of  the protein formed (see page 18).\nThis part is common \nto all amino acids and \nis just shown as a \nshaded rectangle in the examples below.general formula\nglycine cysteineN HR\nH HCC OH\nO\nHC H2SH\n \n\u25b2 fig A  Some differ ent amino acids.

They join in a condensation reaction and a molecule of  water is released. A peptide bond is formed when two amino acids join, and a dipeptide is the result (see fig B). The R group is not involved in this reaction. More and more amino acids join to form polypeptide chains, which contain from about 100 to many thousands of  amino acids. A polypeptide forms a protein when the structure of  the chain changes by folding or coiling or associates with other polypeptide chains.\namino acid 1\ndipeptidepeptide\nbondamino acid 2 (inverted)\nOH + OH N H\nH HCC\nON HHH\nCCO\nOH N H\nH HC C\nONHH\nCCOcondensation hydrolysisR1\nR1R2\nR2H2O H2O\n\u25b2 fig B  Amino acids ar e the building blocks of proteins, joined together  \nby peptide bonds.\nBONDS IN PROTEINS\nThe peptide bond between amino acids is a strong bond.

These same bonds are essential in protein \nstructures. In amino acids, tiny negative charges are present on the oxygen of  the carboxyl groups and tiny positive charges are present on the hydrogen atoms of  the amino groups. When these charged groups are close to each other, the opposite charges attract, forming a hydrogen bond. Hydrogen bonds are weak but, potentially, they can be made between any two amino acids in the correct position, so there are many of  them holding the protein together very firmly. They are very important in the folding and coiling of  polypeptide chains (see fig C). Hydrogen bonds break easily and reform if  pH or temperature conditions change.\nDISULFIDE BONDS\nDisulfide bonds form when two cysteine molecules are close together in the structure of  a polypeptide (see fig C). An oxidation reaction occurs between the two sulfur-containing groups, resulting in a strong covalent bond known as a disulfide bond. These disulfide bonds are much stronger than hydrogen bonds but they happen much less often. They are important for holding the folded polypeptide chains in place.\nhydrogen bondhydrogen bond\ndisul\ufb01de bonddisul\ufb01de bond\n\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\n\u25b2 fig C  Hydr ogen bonds and disulfide bonds maintain the shape of protein molecules and this determines  \ntheir function.\nIONIC BONDS\nIonic bonds can form between some of  the strongly positive and negative amino acid side chains \nwhich are sometimes found deep inside the protein molecules. They are strong bonds, but they are not as common as the other structural bonds.\nY our hair is made of  the protein keratin. Some methods of  styling hair change the bonds within the protein \nmolecules. Blow drying or straightening hair breaks the hydrogen bonds and temporarily reforms them with the hair curling in a different way until the hydrogen bonds reform in their original places.\nPerming is a chemical treatment which is used in some hair salons to completely change the way hair \nlooks for weeks or months. The chemicals break the disulfide bonds between the polypeptide chains and reform them in a different place. This effect is permanent \u2013 hair will stay styled in that particular way until it is cut off.\nPROTEIN STRUCTURE\nProteins can be described by their primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure (see fig\u00a0D). \n \u2022T\nhe primary structure of  a protein is the sequence of  amino acids that make up the polypeptide \nchain, held together by peptide bonds.\n \u2022T\nhe secondary structure of  a protein is the arrangement of  the polypeptide chain into a regular, \nrepeating three-dimensional (3D) structure, held together by hydrogen bonds. One example is the right-handed helix (\u03b1-helix), a spiral coil with the peptide bonds forming the backbone and the R\u00a0groups protruding in all directions. Another is the \u00df-pleated sheet, in which the polypeptide chain folds into regular pleats held together by hydrogen bonds between the amino and carboxyl ends of  the amino acids. Most fibrous proteins have this type of  structure. Sometimes there is no regular secondary structure and the polypeptide forms a random coil.LEARNING TIP\nRemember that fibrous proteins \nhave a simpler structure and so tend to be more stable to changes in temperature and pH.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

The amino acid chain, including any \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-pleated sheets, is folded \nfurther into complicated shapes. Hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds and ionic bonds between the R groups of  nearby amino acids hold these 3D shapes in place (see page 17). Globular proteins are an example of  tertiary structures.\n \u2022T\nhe quaternary structure of  a protein is only found in proteins consisting of  two or more \npolypeptide chains. The quaternary structure describes the way these separate polypeptide chains fit together in three dimensions. Examples include some very important enzymes and the blood pigment haemoglobin. \nChanges in conditions such as temperature or pH affect the bonds that keep the 3D shapes of  proteins in place. Even small changes can cause the bonds to break, resulting in the loss of  the 3D shape of  the protein. This is called denaturation. Because the 3D structure of  these proteins is important to the way they work, changing conditions inside the body can cause proteins such as enzymes to stop working properly.\nalanine cysteine\nlysineglycineleucinePrimary structur e the linear sequence\nof amino acids in a peptide.\nTertiary structure the three-dimensional\nfolding of the secondary structur e.\nQuater nary structure the three-dimensional\narrangement of mo re than one tertiary polypeptide.Secondary structur e the repeating\npatter n in the structure  of the peptide\nchains, such as an \u03b1-helix or \u03b2-pleated\nsheets.\n\u25b2 fig D  T he 3D structure of proteins\nFIBROUS AND GLOBULAR PROTEINS\nFIBROUS PROTEINS\nThe complex structures of  large protein molecules relate closely to their functions in the body. Fibrous proteins have little or no tertiary structure. They are long, parallel polypeptide chains with occasional cross-linkages that form them into fibres. They are insoluble in water and are very tough, which makes them ideally suited to their structural functions within organisms. Fibrous proteins appear in the structure of  connective tissue in tendons and the matrix of  bones, as the silk of  spiders\u2019 webs and silkworm cocoons, and as the keratin that makes up hair, nails, horns and feathers.\nCollagen is a fibrous protein that gives strength to tendons, ligaments, bones and skin. It is the most \ncommon structural protein found in animals \u2013 up to 35% of  the protein in your body is collagen. \nCollagen is extremely strong \u2013 the fibres have a tensile strength similar to that of  steel. This is due to the unusual structure of  the collagen molecule. Its quaternary structure has three polypeptide chains, each up to 1000 amino acids long. The primary structure of  these chains is repeating sequences of  glycine with two other amino acids \u2013 often proline and hydroxyproline. The three polypeptide \u03b1-chains are arranged in a unique triple helix, held together by a very large number of  hydrogen \nbonds. Collagen molecules can be up to several millimetres long and are often found together in fibrils that are held together to form collagen fibres. Y ou can see how collagen fibres are built up in fig E.LEARNING TIP\nRemember that the primary \nstructure of proteins is the result of peptide bonds between amino acids. \nThe secondary structure is the \nresult of hydrogen bonding between nearby amino acids but R groups do not affect it. \nIonic bonds, hydrogen bonds \nand disulfide bridges are a result of interactions between the R\u00a0groups and create the tertiary structure.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

They fold into \nspherical (globular) shapes. The character of  the R groups on the amino acids plays an important role in the formation of  globular proteins. Some R groups are hydrophobic. They repel water and will not mix or dissolve in it. They are usually found on the inside of  globular proteins. Some R groups are hydrophilic \u2013 they have an affinity for water. These groups tend to be found on the outside of  globular proteins. The large size of  these globular protein molecules affects their behaviour in water. \nThe carboxyl and amino ends give them ionic properties, so you might expect them to dissolve in \nwater and form a solution. Instead, the molecules are so big that they form a colloid. In a colloid, microscopic particles of  one substance (in this case protein) are suspended throughout another substance (in this case water). They do not settle, and they cannot easily be separated. Globular proteins are important as they hold molecules in position in the cytoplasm. Globular proteins are also important in your immune system \u2013 for example, antibodies are globular proteins. Enzymes and some hormones are globular proteins and help maintain the structure of  the cytoplasm (you will learn more about globular proteins as enzymes in Sections 2B.1 and 2B.2).\nHaemoglobin is one of  the best known globular proteins. It is a very large molecule with 574 amino \nacids arranged in four polypeptide chains which are connected by disulfide bonds. Each polypeptide chain surrounds an iron-containing haem group (see fig F). The iron enables the haemoglobin to bind and release oxygen molecules, and the arrangement of  the polypeptide chains determines how easily the oxygen binds or is released (see Section 1B.2 to find out how haemoglobin takes up and gives up oxygen in the tissues of  your body).\nEach polypeptide holds one\niron-containing haem group.Each haem group transportsone oxygen molecule.4 polypeptide chainsbond together to makethe globular structur\ne\nof haemoglobin.\n\u25b2 fig F  T he complex quaternary structure of haemoglobin produces a globular protein containing four haem groups \nwhich can carry oxygen to the tissues of the body.LEARNING TIP\nRemember that fibrous proteins \nare more stable than globular proteins and tend to create structures rather than being metabolically active.\nEXAM HINT\nGlobular proteins have a specific 3D shape which means they can be metabolically active as enzymes or hormones.

These cells accumulate chemicals from the blood, especially cholesterol. This leads to a plaque (also known as an atheroma) forming on the endothelial lining of  the artery (see fig C). Fibrous tissue and calcium salts also build up (increase in amount) around the atheroma, turning it into a hardened plaque. This hardened area means that part of  the artery wall is less elastic and narrower than it should be. This is atherosclerosis and is summarised in fig B.\nThe plaque causes the lumen of  the artery to become much smaller. This increases the blood \npressure, making it harder for the heart to pump blood around the body. The raised blood pressure makes damage more likely in other areas of  the endothelial lining and more plaques will form.  This will make the blood pressure even higher, and so the problem gets worse. There are many factors that are linked to the development of  atherosclerosis. Y ou will look at these in more detail  in Chapter 1C.\nEFFECT OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS ON HEALTH\nAtherosclerosis can have many serious effects on the health of  an individual. The development  of  atherosclerosis can be summarised as: damage to the endothelium of  the arteries \u2192 inflammatory response \u2192 accumulation of  cholesterol \u2192 atheroma \u2192 fibrous tissue\/calcium salts \u2192 plaque \u2192 narrowing\/loss of  elasticity of  the artery.\nANEURYSMS\nIf  an area of  an artery is narrowed by plaque, blood tends to collect behind the blockage. The artery bulges and the wall is put under more pressure than usual, so it becomes weakened. This is known as an aneurysm. The weakened artery wall may split open, leading to massive internal bleeding. Aneurysms frequently happen in the blood vessels supplying the brain or in the aorta, especially when it passes through the abdomen. The massive blood loss and drop in blood pressure are often fatal, but if  aneurysms are diagnosed they can be treated by surgery before they burst.\nRAISED BLOOD PRESSURE\nThe arteries narrowed due to plaques on the walls cause raised blood pressure. This can lead to severe damage in a number of  organs, including the kidneys, the eyes and the brain. The high pressure damages the tiny blood vessels where your kidney filters out urea and other substances from the blood. If  the vessels feeding the kidney tubules become narrowed, the pressure inside them gets even higher and proteins may be forced out through their walls. If  you have high blood pressure, your doctors can test for protein in your urine as a sign of  kidney damage. \nSimilarly, the tiny blood vessels supplying the retina of  your eye are easily damaged. If  they become \nblocked or leak, the retinal cells are starved of  oxygen and die and this can cause blindness. \nBleeding from the capillaries into the brain results in one type of  stroke (see below).\nHEART DISEASE\nThere are many kinds of  heart disease, but the two most common ones are angina and myocardial \ninfarction (heart attack); both are closely linked to atherosclerosis (see figs B and D ).\nIn angina, plaques build up slowly in the coronary arteries, reducing blood flow to the parts of  the heart muscle beyond the plaques. Often symptoms are first noticed during exercise, when the cardiac muscle is working harder and needs more oxygen. The narrowed coronary arteries cannot supply enough oxygenated blood and the heart muscle resorts to anaerobic respiration. This causes a gripping pain in the chest that can extend into the arms, particularly the left one, and the jaw, and often also causes breathlessness. The symptoms of  angina subside once exercise stops, but the experience is painful and frightening.\nFortunately, most angina is relatively mild. It can be helped by taking regular exercise, losing weight \nand not smoking. The symptoms can be treated by drugs that cause rapid dilation of  the coronary blood vessels so that they supply the cardiac muscle with the oxygen it needs. However, if  the blockage of  the coronary arteries continues to get worse, so will the symptoms of  the angina. Other drugs are then used to dilate the blood vessels and reduce the heart rate. Unfortunately, drugs cannot \n\u25b2 fig C  F atty deposits like these \nin an artery cause disease and death in millions of people  every year.\nEXAM HINT\nMake sure you are clear about \nall of the different terms.

As you have seen, the wall of  an artery affected  by a plaque is stiffened, making it much more likely to suffer cracks or damage. Platelets touch the damaged surface of  the plaque and the clotting process is triggered (see Section 1B.2). The plaque itself  may rupture and break open, and the cholesterol that is released will also cause the platelets to trigger the blood clotting process. A clot may also develop because the endothelial lining is damaged, for example by high blood pressure or smoking.\nA clot that forms in a blood vessel is known as a thrombosis.  \nThe clot can rapidly block the whole blood vessel, particularly if  it is already narrowed by a plaque. A clot that gets stuck in a coronary artery is known as a coronary thrombosis. The clot  can block the artery, starving the heart muscle beyond that point of  oxygen and nutrients, and this often leads to a heart attack  (see fig E).Blargest heart attack\n(cardiac arre st) follows\nif blockage is at C\nmedium heart attack \u2013 death \nof some heart tissue if blockage is at Bsmall heart attack \u2013 death of small amount of heart tissue if blockage is at AABC\n\u25b2 fig E  T he size and severity of a heart attack is closely related to the \nposition of the blockage in the coronary artery.\nDuring a heart attack, there is chest pain in the same areas as in \nan angina attack, but it is much more severe. The pain may occur at any time, although exercise may start it, and it often lasts for several hours. Death may occur very rapidly with no previous symptoms, or it may happen after several days of  feeling tired and suffering symptoms mistaken for indigestion.\nIt is very important to react quickly if  you suspect someone is \nhaving a heart attack. Give them two full-strength aspirin tablets to help stop the blood clotting, and get them to hospital as fast as you can.\nSTROKES\nA stroke is caused by an interruption to the normal blood supply to an area of  the brain. This may be due to bleeding from damaged capillaries or a blockage cutting off  the blood supply to the brain. A blockage is usually caused by a blood clot, an atheroma or a combination of  the two. Sometimes, the blood clot forms somewhere else in the body and is carried in the bloodstream until it gets stuck in an artery in the brain. The damage happens very quickly. A blockage in one of  the main arteries leading to the brain causes a very serious stroke that may lead to death. In one of  the smaller arterioles leading into the brain, the effects may be less disastrous.\nThe symptoms of  strokes vary, depending on how much of  the \nbrain is affected. Very often, the blood is cut off  from one part or one side of  the brain only (see fig F). Symptoms include dizziness, confusion, slurred speech, blurred vision or partial loss of  vision (usually one eye) and numbness. In more severe strokes, there can be paralysis, usually on one side of  the body.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Some of  these diseases \naffect you randomly \u2013 there is nothing you can do to change whether you are affected or not. However, for many diseases, especially non-communicable (non-infectious) conditions such as heart disease \nand cancer, you can increase or lower your risk of  becoming ill, based on factors in your lifestyle. If  you understand the risk factors, you can help to make yourself  and your family healthier.\nWHAT IS RISK?\nThe word risk is used regularly in everyday conversation, but in science it has a very specific meaning. In science, risk describes the probability that an event will happen. Probability means the chance or likelihood of  the event, calculated mathematically. For example, imagine you have six coloured balls \u2013 red, blue, green, yellow, orange and purple \u2013 in a black cloth bag (see fig A). If  you reach in and pull out a single ball, the probability (risk) of  getting, say, a green ball can be expressed in one of  three ways:\n \u20221 in 6\n \u20220.166\n 66 r\necurring (0.17)\n \u202217%.\nT\nhis is the case for any one of  the six colours in the bag. In the same way, it is possible to work out \nyour risk of  developing certain specified diseases or of  dying from a specified cause. \nHOW DO WE PERCEIVE RISK? \nThe actual risk of  doing something is not always the same as the sense of  risk one feels. Most people don\u2019t think twice before getting into their car \u2013 but globally you have an annual risk of  1 in 5747 of  being killed in a road traffic accident. On the other hand, many people get very worried before flying, but commercial flights have a 1 in 4.5\u20135.5\u00a0million risk of  crashing. Personal perception of  risk is based on a variety of  factors which include: \n \u2022ho\nw familiar you are with the activity \n \u2022ho\nw much you enjoy the activity\n \u2022w\nhether or not you approve of  the activity. \nThe actual mathematical risk may play very little part in developing your personal perception of  risk. People often overestimate the benefits, or minimise the risk, of  behaviour that they want to continue. For example, there is now strong evidence from around the world that obesity is linked to a range of  diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers. However, people like eating and so they still become overweight. On the other hand, they will over-emphasise the risks of  activities if  they want to avoid them or prevent others from doing them. For example, parents over-emphasise the risk of  wandering away to small children, to help make the child behave and stay close.\nIn another example, there is good scientific evidence that smoking affects our risk of  developing \ndiseases such as atherosclerosis, as well as lung cancer. However, knowledge of  the mathematical risk of  an early death if  you smoke cigarettes doesn\u2019t always stop people from smoking.\u25b2 fig A  T he risk, chance or \nprobability that you will pick a blue ball out of the black bag is 1 in 6. If\u00a0you return the ball to the bag each time, you will have exactly the same probability of picking a blue ball again the next time.

But the risk is higher for some people than others, depending on their lifestyle and which genes they inherit.\nIt is possible to identify the risk factors that may contribute to \nthe cause of  a disease. Y ou can look at people who have the same factors (e.g. smoking) and compare their risk of  the disease with the average risk for the whole population. Using these techniques, it appears that there are a number of  factors that increase the likelihood that a person will develop atherosclerosis. If  many factors influence your chance of  having a disease, it is called a multifactorial disease. The study of  the patterns of  diseases and their causes is called epidemiology.\nWhen two different sets of  data change together, there may be a \nlink, which is called a correlation. For example, mortality data from a disease such as atherosclerosis may change in a similar pattern to a lifestyle factor such as smoking or lack of  exercise. However, this does not prove that one is the cause of  the other. They could both be caused by something else which would explain why they change in the same way. Correlation is not the same as causation \u2013 further research is always needed to demonstrate a causal link.\nFor example, fig B shows the percentage of  deaths in the  \nUAE from cardiovascular disease each year. It also shows the statistics for obesity and diabetes. This data suggests a possible correlation between obesity and heart disease. \nDeaths from CVD05101520253035404550\nObesePercentage of the population affected\nOverweight Diabetes33%47.5%\n13%31%\n\u25b2 fig B  T his data shows a possible correlation between obesity, diabetes \nand death from cardiovascular disease (CVD).

However, \nthese UAE data agree with findings from countries around the world that suggest obesity is closely linked to the development of  diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Dr Raghib Ali, principle investigator in the UAE Healthy Future Study, has set up a long-term study in Abu Dhabi. The team is aiming to collect the data needed to confirm the pattern of  increased disease risk in the UAE \u2013 and so to find ways of  reducing the risk of  diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\nCHECKPOINT \n1.

Eat fruit and vegetables, drink orange juice, take lots of  exercise, enjoy these foods \u2013 how do we know which advice is based on good science, and which is given to us because someone wants to sell us something? There are many ways in which you can evaluate the design of  studies to decide if  the data are meaningful.\nDESIGNING STUDIES\nMost epidemiological studies are based on a very big sample size \u2013 usually, the bigger the study, the more meaningful the results. \nThe ideal is to investigate one factor or variable, keeping all other \nvariables the same (controlled). However, controlling variables is almost impossible when you are working with human beings. The way people live is complex and varies a lot, so it is hard to detect how any one factor affects people. When a larger number of  people are studied, it is more likely that patterns may emerge, even with all the other differences between the people involved. Evidence based on large amounts of  data is more likely to be statistically significant than evidence based on small studies.\nSome epidemiological studies are carried out over a long time. \nThese longitudinal studies are very valuable because they follow the same group of  individuals over many years (see fig\u00a0A). This means the impact of  their known lifestyle on their health can be tracked over time. For example, the M\u00fcnster Heart Study looked at cardiovascular disease in 10\n 856 men a\nged 36\u201365 in \nEurope, following them from the start of  the study well into the 21st century. The results from this study are still seen as important because so many people were involved over a long period of  time. The Framingham Study in the US also provided much data \u2013 but was limited because they were all from similar American citizens. The study started in 1948 and it is still going on \u2013 the scientists have widened the population they gather data from, so it is more relevant now.\nAn ambitious new study called the National Children\u2019s Study has \nbeen set up in the US to follow 100\n 000 childr\nen from birth until \nthey are 21 years old. From 2008\u20132012, children were selected to be representative of  the whole of  the US population. One major objective of  the study is to examine how environmental inputs and genetic factors interact to affect the health and development of  children. This is believed to be the biggest longitudinal study ever set up. Similarly, the UAE Healthy Future Study will be longitudinal, looking at the same group of  volunteers over a number of  years.\nSometimes, scientists look at all the available studies in a subject \narea and analyse the available data in a massive literature study. This combines small and large studies and can give more reliable evidence than any one of  the studies alone. This is called a metadata analysis (meta-analysis).\nEVALUATING SCIENTIFIC STUDIES\nWhen considering a study, you need to examine the methodology to see if  it is valid. That means that it is properly designed to answer the question or questions being asked. Y ou also need to see if  the measurements have been carried out with precision. It is important to find out if  other scientists have been able to repeat the methodology and have had similar results \u2013 if  so, the results are considered more reliable.\nIt is also important to know who carried out the research, who \nfunded it and where it was published. Then to decide whether or not any of  these factors might have affected or biased the study. Y ou need to evaluate the data and conclusions from the study in the light of  all these factors.\nEXAM HINT\nRemember the meaning of the following terms.\nValid: answers the question the scientists are askingPrecise: measurements with little difference between themReliable: the investigation is repeatable by other scientists who get \nsimilar results\nThey are important in evaluating all practical work and research.\nIn the next few pages, you are going to look at some of  the \nevidence that scientists have collected suggesting factors that may \u2013 or may not \u2013 affect your risk of  developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In each case, you need to look carefully at the type of  evidence that is presented and think about what else you need to know to make firm conclusions.\nRISK FACTORS FOR CVDs\nThe results from many epidemiological studies have identified a range of  risk factors linked to CVDs. These factors divide into two main groups \u2013 those you can\u2019t change and those you can do something about (see Section 1C.3).\nNON-MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS FOR ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nThere are three main risk factors for CVDs which cannot (at the present time) be changed.\n \u2022Genes\n: studies show that there is a genetic tendency (trend) \nin some families, and also in some ethnic groups, to develop CVDs.

This can make you more likely \nto suffer from CVDs, particularly heart disease.\n \u2022Gender\n: statistically, under the age of  50, men are more likely \nto suffer from heart disease (and other CVDs) than women. The female hormone oestrogen, which is an important factor in the woman\u2019s menstrual cycle, appears to reduce the build-up of  plaque. This gives women some protection against CVDs until they go through the menopause when oestrogen levels fall.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that risk factors do not cause the disease, they contribute \nto the chances of developing the disease.\nLOOKING AT THE DATA\nIdentical twin studies are an excellent resource when investigating \nwhether there is a genetic factor at work, because identical twins have exactly the same genes. Any differences should therefore be due to the environment in which they live. A major twin study was conducted in Sweden and was based on over 21\n 000 pair\ns of  twins, \nboth identical and non-identical. This study showed that (for male twins) if  one twin died of  heart disease between the ages of  36 and 55, then the risk of  the other twin also dying of  heart disease was eight times higher than if  neither was affected (see fig A). However, as the twins got older, one dying of  heart disease had less of  a correlation with the other twin also dying of  heart disease. In other words, there appears to be a clear genetic link to heart disease in younger men, but it gets less in much older men. \nEpidemiological studies have also identified several lifestyle \nfactors linked to CVDs, some of  which you will look at in the following pages. These lifestyle factors are important for health because they are the factors that we can change.\nCHECKPOINT \nSKILLS EXECUTIVE FUNCTION\n1.

This will help you to understand what the question is asking for.\nMODIFIABLE (LIFESTYLE) RISK FACTORS FOR CVDs\nThe development of  atherosclerosis is linked to many types of  CVD. Y our lifestyle can affect your \nrisk of  developing atherosclerosis in the future. Epidemiological studies have shown links with smoking, diet and weight, lack of  activity and high blood pressure. These are the factors we can change, so we can change our risk of  developing CVDs by the lifestyle choices we make.\nSMOKING AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nStudies have shown that smokers are far more likely to develop atherosclerosis than non-smokers with a similar lifestyle. Nine out of  ten people who need heart bypass surgery or stents as a result of  atherosclerosis are smokers. In 2007, a Spanish study showed a clear correlation between smoking and the incidence of  death from atherosclerotic heart disease. Causation was established by further research. For example, studies found that the substances in tobacco smoke:\n \u2022can dama\nge the artery linings, which makes the build-up of  plaques more likely\n \u2022can cause the ar\nteries to narrow, raise the blood pressure and increase the risk of  atherosclerosis.\nSimilar findings were made in a study on adults with heart disease in Jordan in 2017 (see fig B).1.16 1.12\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

These also lower your risk of  developing atherosclerosis and CVDs. A study of  10\n 269 male Har\nvard University (USA) graduates aged between \n45 and 84 showed that the men who changed from being inactive to taking regular exercise had a 23% lower mortality over the life of  the study than those who did not exercise. Moreover, the main cause of  the deaths was atherosclerosis and the linked CVDs. A study of  72\n 488 f\nemale nurses \nshowed the same benefits for women \u2013 the more active women had a significantly lower risk of  developing atherosclerosis and other CVDs. \nA 2013 study from Sri Lanka showed a similar pattern \u2013 high levels of  inactivity were linked to an \nincreased risk of  obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and CVDs. High levels of  activity were linked to a reduced risk of  all these conditions. Several studies have shown that exercise both reduces the formation of  plaques in the arteries and also keeps plaques that are present more stable and less likely to break.\nHIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nAs you saw in Section 1B.4, the heart pumps blood out into your arteries in a regular rhythm. The blood travels through your arterial system at pressures which change as your heart beats and which are easily measured (see fig C). At systole, when the blood is forced out of  the heart, a healthy blood pressure is around 120\n mmHg\n. When the heart is relaxed and filling during diastole, a healthy blood \npressure is around 80\n mmHg\n. Measuring blood pressure is used as an indicator of  the health of  both \nyour heart and your blood vessels. Y our blood pressure goes up and down naturally during the day \u2013 but it shouldn\u2019t be constantly raised. If  your blood pressure is regularly above 140\/90\n mmHg\n, you \nhave high blood pressure or hypertension. Raised blood pressure can be a sign of  atherosclerosis. The blood pressure goes up when the walls of  the arteries become less flexible due to the build-up of  plaque, and when the lumen of  the arteries get narrower as they are blocked by the plaques. This means that raised blood pressure can be the result of  atherosclerosis and can be used to help diagnose the disease.\n\u25b2 fig C  Doctors can use a blood pr essure monitor like this to check that your blood pressure is in the healthy range. \nSome people buy and use their own monitor, so they can check their blood pressure regularly to help prevent them \ngetting CVDs.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Why do they do this? \nPREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE \nCardiovascular disease has a negative effect on individuals, on families  and on society. It costs a lot of  money to treat people in hospital. When  people are too ill to work, they are losing money for their families, and  also for the companies where they work. Treating people with drugs to  prevent them from needing surgery is cheaper for health service providers.  It is even cheaper (and better for the individual) if  we can stop ourselves  needing the drugs. So, prevention is better than treatment for CVDs for  many reasons (see fig A). However, persuading people to change their  \nlifestyle habits is often difficult.\nFor example, there is a lot of  reliable evidence to show that smoking is  \none of  the highest risk factors for CVDs. However, if  you stop smoking,  your risk of  developing heart disease is almost halved after just one year.  Moreover, research carried out by a team led by Azra Mahmud from  Trinity College Dublin and published in 2007 suggests that after 10 years,  the arteries of  smokers who stop smoking are the same as if  they had  never smoked. There is a lot of  support available for people who want to  stop smoking. Y et, despite all this, almost 1 billion people around the  world smoke cigarettes and millions of  them die each year of  CVDs and  cancers linked to their smoking. \nHealth education programmes in schools and communities can help to  \nmake sure that everyone is aware of  the risks associated with different  lifestyle choices. However, each individual has to make their own choices  and take their own risks.\nOVERWEIGHT OR UNDERFIT?\nMost people are aware that obesity is linked to CVDs, and many go on  slimming diets to try to lose weight. Most people also know that taking  regular exercise helps protect against CVDs \u2013 but more people choose to  go on a diet than choose to take regular exercise. The results of  a study  carried out over an average of  eight years on 20\n 000 men a\nged from  \n30 to 83 years are given in Section 1C.4 fig\u00a0B. Fitness was defined by  how much oxygen they used during exercise. The results show that if  you  are obese and fit you have a lower risk of  dying from CVDs than someone  who is not obese but unfit. Obviously, being the correct weight and fit is  best of  all! \nThe problem is that many people enjoy their food, and don\u2019t take sufficient exercise. It takes a lot of  \neffort to cut down the amount of  food you eat and change to eating healthier foods including lots of  fruit and vegetables. \u25b2\n fig A  Infogr aphics like this one published in Gulf News help \npeople understand the factors which affect their heart health.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember to read all the \ninformation in graphics.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Changing lifestyle, such as improving diet, giving up smoking and taking more exercise can help but there are also various drugs that can be given. The drugs aim to reduce the risks associated with CVDs by helping to prevent problems developing. However, all medicines carry some risk. \nCONTROLLING BLOOD PRESSURE\nAs you have seen, hypertension or high blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.\nANTIHYPERTENSIVES\nDrugs that reduce blood pressure are known as antihypertensives. Some commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs are described below.\n \u2022T\nreatment often begins with diuretics, which increase the volume \nof  urine produced. This eliminates excess fluids and salts, so that the blood volume decreases. With less blood, a smaller volume is pumped from the heart and the blood pressure falls. \n \u2022Beta b\nlockers interfere with the normal system for controlling \nthe heart. They block the response of  the heart to hormones such as adrenaline, which normally act to speed up the heart and increase the blood pressure (you will find out more in Book 2 Topic 7). So, beta blockers make the heart rate slower and the contractions less strong, so the blood pressure is lower.\nSympathetic nerve inhibitors affect the sympathetic nerves which go from your central nervous system to all parts of  your body (you will find out more in Book 2 Topic 7). Sympathetic nerves stimulate your arteries to constrict, which raises your blood pressure. The inhibitors prevent these nerves signalling to the arteries, which helps to keep the arteries dilated and your blood pressure lower.\n \u2022Angiotensin is a hor\nmone which stimulates the constriction of  \nyour blood vessels and so causes the blood pressure to rise. ACE inhibitors block the production of  angiotensin, which reduces the constriction of  your blood vessels and so keeps your blood pressure lower.\nThe benefits of  these drugs in reducing blood pressure are clear. They reduce the risk of  CVDs, and also reduce the risk of  damage to the kidneys and eyes from the high blood pressure. \nBut there are risks. The risks of  these treatments are twofold. \nIf  the treatment is not monitored carefully, your blood pressure may become too low. That can lead to falls and injuries which, particularly in elderly patients, can be serious and even life-threatening. The second major risk is the side-effects that may result from the way your body reacts to the drugs. Each type of  drug has its own possible side-effects (see fig A). For a drug to be given a licence for use, the benefits of  the treatment must be judged to outweigh any side-effects.\nThe side-effects from commonly used antihypertensives include \ncoughs, swelling of  the ankles, impotence, tiredness and fatigue, and constipation. These are not serious compared with the health risks from high blood pressure \u2013 but to the patient they may feel very significant. High blood pressure often doesn\u2019t make you feel ill, but the medication needed to control it can affect your quality of  life. Doctors find many patients stop taking their medication \u2013 the side-effects make them ignore the much larger but invisible risk of  CVDs.\n\u25b2 fig A  All medically licensed drugs c ome with instructions and information \nwhich includes possible side-effects known to be caused by the drug.\nEXAM HINT\nIf you are asked to discuss or evaluate the use of medication or some \nother treatment, you must remember to include both the benefits and the potential risks associated with the treatment.\nSTATINS\nStatins are a group of  drugs that lower the level of  cholesterol in \nyour blood. They block the enzyme in the liver that is responsible for making cholesterol, and are very effective at blocking the production of  LDLs. Statins also improve the balance of  LDLs to HDLs and reduce inflammation in the lining of  the arteries. Both functions reduce the risk of  atherosclerosis developing.\nFig B shows the results from a trial using statins with a group of  6605 \nAsian Indians in the US. This shows the results for men and women, and other groups who are high-risk categories for cardiovascular disease. Statins reduce the incidence of  serious cardiovascular disease in all categories, but they seem to have a greater effect for some groups than for others.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Statins had a strong positive \nbenefit to a range of patients.\nA UK study showed that men who took a particular statin for five \nyears had a lower risk of  death or heart attack, even 10 years after they stopped taking the drug. The study involved 6595 middle-aged men. It showed that for the first five years, the overall risk of  heart attack or death from any type of  heart disease was 11.8% for the men who took the statin, compared with 15.5% for men who took a placebo (an inactive substance that resembles the drug but has no action in the body). The risk was reduced the most while the men were taking the drug, but some level of  protection lasted for up to 10 years afterwards.\nMost people use statins with little or no ill effect. Side-effects of  \nmuscle and joint aches and nausea, constipation and diarrhoea are sometimes reported. However, there are two serious but very rare side-effects. In a tiny number of  people, statins trigger a form of  muscle inflammation which can be fatal. For example, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported 3339 cases of  these muscle reactions between January 1990 and March 2002, but during this time millions of  Americans took statins daily. Statins can also cause liver problems in a small group. As an example, the risk of  liver damage in people taking lovastatin is two in a million. Out of  51\n 741 li\nver transplant patients in the US \nbetween 1990 and 2002, liver failure appeared to be caused by statins in only three cases.\nAnother risk is more subtle: there is a risk that, if  people take \nstatins to lower their blood cholesterol, they will no longer try to eat a healthy diet, and statins give no protection against the other ill effects of  a bad diet.\nPlant stanols and sterols are now widely sold in spreads \nand yoghurts. These compounds are very similar in structure to cholesterol. They reduce the amount of  cholesterol absorbed from your gut into your blood, which can make it easier for your body to metabolise cholesterol and reduce the levels of  LDLs in the blood. Products like these are sold as a food, not as a drug. While there is scientific evidence that they are effective in many people, they have not undergone the levels of  testing that drugs such as statins have. Metadata analysis has shown that these products do work if  they are eaten regularly in the recommended amounts (2\n g \nper da\ny of  plant sterols and stanols). It has been estimated that \nthese products can lower your risk of  heart disease by about 25% if  they are used correctly (see fig C).Plant sterols (g\/d)LDL cholesterol (% change)0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5\n41 trials with plant sterols\/stanols:\n95% Cl from meta-analysisKatan et al.

Here are two examples.\nWarfarin is an anticoagulant that interferes with the \nmanufacture of  prothrombin in the body. Low prothrombin levels make the blood clot less easily (see Section 1B.2). Warfarin has been used in rat poison \u2013 in high doses the blood will not clot at all and the rats bleed to death after the slightest injury. In humans, the dose is carefully monitored to make sure that the clotting of  the blood is reduced but not prevented completely. \nPlatelet inhibitory drugs make the platelets less sticky, and \nso reduce the clotting ability of  the blood. The cheapest and most common of  these is aspirin (fig D) but clopidogrel is also commonly used. \n\u25b2 fig D  Aspirin is a r elatively cheap drug. It has been used traditionally  \nas a painkiller. It is also a very effective way of preventing many \ncardiovascular problems.\nThe risks of  taking aspirin are well known \u2013 it irritates the \nstomach lining and causes bleeding in the stomach which can become serious. A combination of  aspirin and clopidogrel can reduce the risk of  developing a range of  cardiovascular diseases by 20\u201325% in some low-risk patients. However, based on data from several studies it appears that, for some patients, the risk of  side-effects is much higher when the two drugs are combined. For example, for every 1000 patients at high risk of  CVDs treated for 28 months, five cardiovascular events would be avoided \u2013 but three major stomach bleeds would be caused. In lower-risk patients, 23 cardiovascular events would be avoided while 10 major bleeds would be caused. It is difficult to achieve the correct balance between preventing the blood from clotting too easily while allowing it to clot when necessary. For example, when people are treated with anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin, they must be monitored very carefully to make sure that they do not bleed internally, particularly in the brain. The decision whether to give warfarin will depend on many factors, including the patient\u2019s age and condition as well as other medication they may be taking.\nCHECKPOINT \n1.
