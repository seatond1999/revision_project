Plants store excess glucose as starch (when a plant needs more glucose for energy, it breaks down starch to release the glucose).2) Starch is a mixture of two polysaccharides of alpha-glucose \u2014 amylose and amylopectin:\u2022 Amylose \u2014 a long, unbranched chain of a-glucose. The angles of the glycosidic bonds give it a coiled structure, almost like a cylinder. This makes it compact, so it's really good for storage because you can fit more in to a small space.\u2022 Amylopectin \u2014 a long, branched chain of a-glucose. Its side branches allow the enzymes that break down the molecule to get at the glycosidic bonds easily.This means that the glucose can be released quickly. Amylopectin3) Starch is insoluble in water and doesn't affect water potential (see page 40), so it doesn't cause water to enter cells by osmosis, which would make them swell.This makes it good for storage.Use the Iodine Test for StarchIf you do any experiment on the digestion of starch and want to find out if any is left, you'll need the iodine test.just add iodine dissolved in potassium iodide solution to the test sample. If there is starch present, the sample changes from browny-orange to a dark, blue-black colour.Glycogen is the Main Energy Storage Material in AnimalsGlycogen1) Animal cells get energy from glucose too.But animals store excess glucose as glycogen\u2014 another polysaccharide of alpha-glucose.2) Its structure is very similar to amylopectin, except that it has loads more side branches coming off it. Loads of branches means that stored glucose can be released quickly, which is important for energy release in animals.3) It's also a very compact molecule, so it's good for storage.After throwing and fetching the ball no less than 312 times, Chappy and Stuart were finally out of glycogen.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","3":"6LipidsLipids are really nice.

They're good for this because:1) The long hydrocarbon tails of the fatty acids contain lots of chemical energy\u2014 a load of energy is released when they're broken down. Because of these ^ CPtails, lipids contain about twice as much energy per gram as carbohydrates. q ^2) They're insoluble, so they don't affect the water potential (see p. 40) of r,the cell and cause water to enter the cells by osmosis (which would make them ^ ^swell). The triglycerides clump together as insoluble droplets in cells because ^ {\/the fatty acid tails are hydrophobic (water-repelling) \u2014 the tails face inwards, es &shielding themselves from water with their glycerol heads.Phospholipids make up the bilayer of cell membranes (see p. 36).Cell membranes control what enters and leaves a cell.1) Their heads are hydrophilic and their tails are hydrophobic, so they forma double layer with their heads facing out towards the water on either side.2) The centre of the bilayer is hydrophobic, so water-soluble substances can't easily pass through it \u2014 the membrane acts as a barrier to those substances.Use the Emulsion Test for LipidsIf you wanted to find out if there was any fat in aparticular food you could do the emulsion test:1) Shake the test substance with ethanol for about a minute so that it dissolves, then pour the solution into water.2) Any lipid will show up as a milky emulsion.3) The more lipid there is, the more noticeable the milky colour will be.Test substance and ethanolShakesAdd to waterMilky colour indicates lipidPractice QuestionsQ1 What type of bond is made from a condensation reaction between glycerol and a fatty acid molecule?Q2 Describe how you would test for lipids in a solution.Exam QuestionsQ1 Triglycerides have a hydrophobic tail.

Here are two reasons why:1) If two substrate molecules need to be joined, being attached to the enzyme holds them close together, reducing any repulsion between the molecules so they can bond more easily.2) If the enzyme is catalysing a breakdown reaction, fitting into the active site puts a strain on bonds in the substrate, so the substrate molecule breaks up more easily.chemical reaction beginsactivation ener^y_neede_d _ without enzymeenergy is released as the product is formedTime- chemical reaction without enzyme-chemicalreactionwithenzymeThe \u2018L o c k  and K e y \u2019 Model is a Good Start...Enzymes are a bit picky \u2014 they only work with substrates that fit their active site.

This means the substrate won't fit into the active site, an enzyme-substrate complex won't be formed and the enzyme will no longer be able to carry out its function.6) The tertiary structure of an enzyme may be altered by changes in pH or temperature (see next page).7) The primary structure (amino acid sequence) of a protein is determined by a gene. If a mutation occurs in that gene (see p. 91), it could change the tertiary structure of the enzyme produced.Practice QuestionsQ1 What is an enzyme?Q2 What is the name given to the amount of energy needed to start a reaction?Q3 What is an enzyme-substrate complex?Q4 Why can an enzyme only bind to one substance?[4 marks] [2 marks]Exam QuestionsQ1 Dcscribc the \u2018induced fit\u2019 model of enzyme action.Q2 Explain how a change in the amino acid sequence of an enzyme may prevent it from functioning properly.But why is the enzyme-substrate complex?So enzymes lower the activation energy of a reaction.

Humans need things like money and the newest mobile phone, but enzymes are quite content with the right temperature and pH.Temperature has a Big Influence on Enzyme ActivityLike any chemical reaction, the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction increases when the temperature's increased. More heat means more kinetic energy, so molecules move faster. This makes the enzymes more likely to collide with the substrate molecules. The energy of these collisions also increases, which means each collision is more likely to result in a reaction. But, if the temperature gets too high, the reaction stops.1) The rise in temperature makes the enzyme's molecules vibrate more.2) If the temperature goes above a certain level, this vibration breaks some of the bonds that hold the enzyme in shape.3) The active site changes shape and the enzyme and substrate no longer fit together.4) At this point, the enzyme is denatured\u2014 it no longer functions as a catalyst.optimum temperature11 nn 11,TemperaturepH Also Affects Enzyme ActivityO\u2019\" \" I M I | | | ,, , ,~ Every enzyme has an enzyme is r optimum temperature = denatured r For most human enzymes - r ,t,saro^37\u00b0C but some r _ enzymes, like those used in ~- biological washing powders, ~ ~ can work well at 60 \u00b0C ~All enzymes have an optimum pH value.

So increasing the concentration of the enzyme increases the rate of reaction.2) But, if the amount of substrate is limited, there comes a point when there's more than enough enzyme molecules to deal with all the available substrate, so adding more enzyme has no further effect.steady increase as more active sites are available \\if substrate amount is limited, an increase in enzyme concentration eventually has no further effectEnzyme ConcentrationSubstrate Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction Up to a Pointsteady increase as more substrate molecules are availableall active sites used \u2014 increase in substrate concentration has no further effectSubstrate Concentration1) The higher the substrate concentration, the faster the reaction \u2014 more substrate molecules means a collision between substrate and enzyme is more likely and so more active sites will be used.

So increasing the concentration of substrate will increase the rate of reaction (up to a point).NON-COMPETITIVE INHIBITION1) Non-competitive inhibitor molecules bind to the enzyme away from its active site.2) This causes the active site to change shape so the substrate molecules can no longer bind to it.3) They don't 'compete' with the substrate molecules to bind to the active site because they are a different shape.4) Increasing the concentration of substrate won't make any difference to the reaction rate \u2014 enzyme activity will still be inhibited.inhibitor molecule fits onto enzyme away from active siteenzymesubstrate molecule can no longer fit into active siteVXinhibitor causes changes that alter active sitensCZ.nsO'enzyme-controlled reaction without an inhibitorsame reaction with a non-competitive inhibitor \u2014 increasing the substrate conc. has little effect on rateiSubstrate ConcentrationPractice QuestionsQ1 Draw a graph to show the effect of temperature on enzyme activity.Q2 Draw a graph to show the effect of pH on enzyme activity.Q3 Explain the effect of increasing substrate concentration on the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction.Exam QuestionQ1 Inhibitors prevent enzymes from working properly.

You might be asked to interpret the graph of an enzyme-controlled reaction in the exam. The graph below shows the release of a product over time:Volume of product released by an enzyme-controlled reaction at different temperatures\u201c 50 '\u00a9 First look at the start of the graph and compare the rates of reaction here. E.g. the rate of reaction is fastest at 65 \u00b0C. Use what you know about factors affecting enzyme activity to explain why (see p. 12). You might have to work out the initial rate of reaction (see below).i i(T) Nov\/ look at what else the graphs are showing you and make comparisons between the different temperatures. At 37 \u00b0C the graph has plateaued (flattened out) because all the substrate has been used up.At 65 \u00b0C the graph has plateaued earlier than at 37 \u00b0C, because the high temperature caused the enzyme to denature, so the reaction stopped sooner. Not as much product was made because not all the substrate was converted to product before the enzyme was denatured, so there is still substrate left.At 25 \u00b0C the rate of reaction is remaining constant and the volume of product is continuing to increase because not all of the substrate has been used up.You Can Use a Tangent to Calculate the Initial Rate of ReactionThe initial rate of reaction is the rate of reaction right at the start of the reaction, close to time equals zero (t = 0) on the graph.

This means that there are always equal amounts of adenine and thymine in a DNA molecule and equal amounts of cytosine and guanine.4) Two hydrogen bonds form between A and T, and three hydrogen bonds form between C and G.5) Two antiparallel (running in opposite directions) polynucleotide strands twist to form the DNA double-helix.6) DNA was first observed in the 1800s, but lots of scientists at the time doubted that it could carry the genetic code because it has a relatively simple chemical composition. Some argued that genetic information must be carried by proteins \u2014 which are much more chemically varied.7) By 1953, experiments had shown that DNA was the carrier of the genetic code. This v\/as also the year in which the double-helix structure, which helps DNA to carry out its function, was determined by Watson and Crick.RNA is a Relatively Short Polynucleotide ChainRNA is made from a single polynucleotide chain (not a double one).

These pages cover the facts behind the replication mechanism, as well as some of the history behind its discovery. This stuff is really clever. Honest.DNA Replicates by Semi-Conservative ReplicationDNA copies itself before cell division (see p. 32) so that each new cell has the full amount of DNA.The method is called semi-conservative replication because half of the strands in each new DNA moleculeare from the original DNA molecule. This means that there's genetic continuity between generations of cells (i.e. the cells produced by cell division inherit their genes from their parent cells).1)The enzyme DNA helicase breaks the hydrogen bondsbetween bases on the two polynucleotide DNA strands. This makes the helix unwind to form two single strands.Breaks the hydrogen bonds2)Each original single strand acts as a template for a new strand.

Hydrogen bonds form between the bases on the original and new strands.DNA polymerase joins the nucleotides. Hydrogen bonds form between the strands.4) Each new DNA molecule contains one strand from the original DNA molecule and one new strand.New strand-TA--TA--AT--AT--G:C--G::C-Original-GiC--G:C-DNA strand-A T--A T-SsS3DNA Polymerase Moves in Opposite Ways Along Antiparallel DNA StrandsEach end of a DNA strand is slightly different in its structure.One end is called the 3' (pronounced 'three prime') end and one end is called the 5' (five prime) end. In a DNA helix, the strands run in opposite directions \u2014 they're antiparallel.The active site of DNA polymerase is only complementary to the 3' endof the newly forming DNA strand \u2014 so the enzyme can only add nucleotides to the new strand at the 3' end.This means that the new strand is made in a 5' to 3' direction and that 3'- DNA polymerase moves down the template strand in a 3' to 5' direction. Because the strands in the double-helix are antiparallel, the DNA polymerase working on one of the template strands moves in the opposite direction to the DNA polymerase working on the other template strand.DNA Polymerase\nDNA PolymeraseTopic 1B \u2014 More Biological Molecules\n79DNA ReplicationMeselson and Stahl Provided Evidence for Semi-Conservative Replication1) You might remember from page 17 that Watson and Crick determined the structure of DNA.They also came up with the theory of semi-conservative DNA replication.2) It wasn't until Meselson and Stahl's experiment a few years later that this theory was validated.Before that, people were unsure whether DNA replication was semi-conservative or conservative.If the method was conservative, the original DNA strands would stay together and the new DNA molecules would contain two new strands.3) Meselson and Stahl showed that DNA is replicated using the semi-conservative method, r differentT *** -Their experiment used two isotopes of nitrogen (DNA contains nitrogen) j s<am^ orms \u00a3\u2014 heavy nitrogen (15N) and light nitrogen (,4N). Here's how it worked: '\/ftntnw,Initial DNA sample CD Initial DNA sample containing light nitrogen containing heavy nitrogen<DLight DNA settled out here in centrifuge tubeHeavy nitrogen bacteria replicates in light nitrogen brothConservative 0\nDNA with only heavy original strands and only light new strands would settle out here.Heavy DNA settled out here in centrifuge tube\nSemi-conservative\nDNA with a combination of heavy original strands and light new strands settled out here.1) Two samples of bacteria were grown \u2014 one in a nutrient broth containing light nitrogen, and one in a broth with heavy nitrogen. As the bacteria reproduced, they took up nitrogen from the broth to help make nucleotides for new DNA. So the nitrogen gradually became part of the bacteria's DNA.2) A sample of DNA was taken from each batch of bacteria, and spun in a centrifuge. The DNA from the heavy nitrogen bacteria settled lower down the centrifuge tube than the DNA from the light nitrogen bacteria \u2014 because it's heavier.3) Then the bacteria grown in the heavy nitrogen broth were taken out and put in a broth containing only light nitrogen. The bacteria were left for one round of DNA replication, and then another DNA sample was taken out and spun in the centrifuge.4) If replication was conservative, the original heavy DNA, which would still be together, would settle at the bottom and the new light DNA would settle at the top.5) If replication was semi-conservative, the new bacterial DNA molecules would contain one strand of the old DNA containing heavy nitrogen and one strand of new DNA containing light nitrogen. So the DNA would settle out between where the light nitrogen DNA settled out and where the heavy nitrogen DNA settled out.6) As it turned out, the DNA settled out in the middle, showing that the DNA molecules contained a mixture of heavy and light nitrogen. The bacterial DNA had replicated semi-conservatively in the light nitrogen.Once Meselson and Stahl had confirmed that DNA replication in bacteria was semi-conservative, other scientists carried out experiments to show that it was the universal method for DNA replication in all living things.Practice QuestionsQ1 What is the role of DNA helicase in DNA replication?Q2 What's the key difference between the conservative and semi-conservative theories of DNA replication?Exam QuestionQ1 Dcscribc the process of semi-conservative DNA replication.

You'll need to think about what organelles the cell needs to do its job \u2014 e.g. if the cell uses a lot of energy, it'll need lots of mitochondria. If it makes a lot of proteins it'll need a lot of ribosomes.Example:1)2)3)Epithelial cells in the small intestine are specialised to absorb food efficiently.The walls of the small intestine have lots of finger-like projections microvilli increasei \u2022 \/\u2022 ft surface areacalled villi.

You'll need to think about what organelles the cell needs to do its job \u2014 e.g. if the cell uses a lot of energy, it'll need lots of mitochondria. If it makes a lot of proteins it'll need a lot of ribosomes.Example:1)2)3)Epithelial cells in the small intestine are specialised to absorb food efficiently.The walls of the small intestine have lots of finger-like projections microvilli increasei \u2022 \/\u2022 ft surface areacalled villi. These increase surface area for absorption.The epithelial cells on the surface of the villi have folds in their cell-surface nucleusmembranes, called microvilli. Microvilli increase surface area even more. ^cytoplasmThey also have lots of mitochondria \u2014 to provide energy forthe transport of digested food molecules into the celL mitochondriaSpecialised Cells are Organised into Tissues, Organs and Organ Systems1) In multicellular eukaryotic organisms, specialised cells are grouped together to form tissues.2) A tissue is a group of cells working together to perform a particular function.3) Different tissues work together to form organs. Different organs make up an organ system.For example...Epithelial cells make up epithelial tissue. Epithelial tissue, muscular tissue and glandular tissue(which secretes chemicals) all work together to form the stomach \u2014 an organ. The stomach is part of the digestive system \u2014 this is an organ system made up of all the organs involved in the digestion and absorption of food (including the small intestine, large intestine and liver).Practice QuestionsQ1 What is a plant cell wall made of?

I'm afraid they'll keep popping up throughout the rest of the hook \u2014 mitochondria are needed for respiration, the cell-surface membrane is essential for controlling the movement of things in and out of the cell, and all the DNA stuff happens in the nucleus.Topic 2 A \u2014 Cell Structure and Division\n","21":"30Analysis of Cell ComponentsYou can use microscopes to look at all the lovely organelles you've been learning about...Magnification is Size, Resolution is DetailWe all know that microscopes produce a magnified image of a sample, but resolution is just as important...\nThere are Two Main Types of Microscope \u2014 Optical and ElectronOptical (light) microscopes ------------------------------1) They use light to form an image.2) They have a maximum resolution of about0.2 micrometres (pm). This means you can't use an optical microscope to view organelles smaller than 0.2 pm. That includes ribosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes. You may be able to make out mitochondria \u2014 but not in perfect detail. You can also see the nucleus.3) The maximum useful magnification of an optical microscope is about x 1500.1) TEMs use electromagnets to focus a beam of electrons, which is then transmitted through the specimen.2) Denser parts of the spccimcn absorb more electrons, which makes them look darker on the image you end up with.3) TEMs are good because they give high resolution images, so you see the internal structure of organelles like chloroplasts.4) But they can only be used on thin specimens.Electron microscopes ---------------------------------1) They use electrons to form an image.2) They have a higher resolution than optical microscopes so give a more detailed image (and can be used to look at more organelles).3) They have a maximum resolution of about 0.0002 micrometres (|jm). (About 1000 times higher than optical microscopes.)4) The maximum useful magnification of an electron microscope is about x 1 500 000.'1 \"1111' 11 u ii 111 m in ii\/ A micrometre (jjm) is three - orders of magnitude smaller z than a millimetre (1 ym = -0.001 mm).

This knocks off electrons from the specimen, which are gathered in a cathode ray tube to form an image.2) The images you end up with show the surface of the specimen and they can be 3-D.3) SEMs are good because they can be used on thick specimens.4) But they give lower resolution images than TEMs.Electron Microscopes are either Scanning\u2019or \u2018Transmission\u2019Transmission electron microscopes (TEMs)Scanning electron microscopes (SEMs)1)\nYou View Specimens Under an Optical Microscope Using SlidesHere's how to prepare a 'temporary mount' of a specimen on a slide:\u2022 Start by pipetting a small drop of water onto the slide (a strip of clear glass or plastic).Then use tweezers to place a thin section of your specimen on top of the water drop.\u2022 Add a drop of a stain. Stains are used to highlight objects in a cell. For example, eosin is used to make the cytoplasm show up. Iodine in potassium iodide solution (see p. 4) is used to stain starch grains in plant cells.\u2022 Finally, add the cover slip (a square of clear plastic that protects the specimen). To do so, stand the slip upright on the slide, next to the water droplet. Then carefully tilt and lower it so it covers the specimen.Try not to get any air bubbles under there \u2014 they'll obstruct your view of the specimen (see page 35).Topic 2A \u2014 Cell Structure and Division\n","22":"31Analysis of Cell ComponentsCell Fractionation Separates OrganellesSuppose you wanted to look at some organelles under an electron microscope. First you'd need to separate them from the rest of the cell \u2014 you can do this by cell fractionation. There are three steps to this technique:(7) Homogenisation \u2014 Breaking Up the Cells jHomogenisation can be done in several different ways, e.g. by vibrating the cells or by grinding the cells up in a blender. This breaks up the plasma membrane and releases the organelles into solution. The solution must be kept ice-cold, to reduce the activity of enzymes that break down organelles. The solution should also be isotonic \u2014 this means it should have the same concentration of chemicals as the cells being broken down, to prevent damage to the organelles through osmosis. A buffer solution should be added to maintain the pH.(7) Filtration \u2014 Getting Rid of the Big Bits )Next, the homogenised cell solution is filtered through a gauze to separate any large cell debris or tissue debris, like connective tissue, from the organelles.The organelles are much smaller than the debris, so they pass through the gauze.(3) Ultracentrifugation \u2014 Separating the Organelles JAfter filtration, you're left with a solution containing a mixture of organelles. To separate a particular organelle from all the others you use ultracentrifugation.1) The cell fragments are poured into a tube. The tube is put into a centrifuge (a machine that separates material by spinning) and is spun at a low speed. The heaviest organelles, like nuclei, get flung to the bottom of the tube by the centrifuge. They form a thick sediment at the bottom\u2014 the pellet. The rest of the organelles stay suspended in the fluid above the sediment \u2014 the supernatant.2) The supernatant is drained off, poured into another tube, and spun in the centrifuge at a higher speed.Again, the heaviest organelles, this time the mitochondria, form a pellet at the bottom of the tube. The supernatant containing the rest of the organelles is drained off and spun in the centrifuge at an even higher speed.3) This process is repeated at higher and higher speeds, until all the organelles are separated out. Each time, the pellet at the bottom of the tube is made up of lighter and lighter organelles.As the ride got faster, everyone felt their nuclei sink to their toes..- Plant cells,~ the chloroplasts :Z corne out after the = ~ nuclei, but before ~z. the mitochondria. - . . \" \" '1111111 \\ 1 n'endoplasmicreticulumribosomeslysosomesmitochondrianuclei\u2019The organelles are separatedorder of mass(from heaviest to lightest) \u2014 this order is usually: nuclei, then mitochondria, then lysosomes, then endoplasmic reticulum, and finally ribosomes.Practice QuestionsQ1 What is meant by a microscope's magnification?Q2 What is meant by a microscope's resolution?Exam QuestionsQ1 The table shows the dimensions of some different organelles found in animal cells.Name those organelles in the table that would be visible using a good quality light microscope.Explain your answer.

Here's an example:4.5. eyepiece divisions = 1 stage divisionEyepiece graticule 10 20 30 40 5020301 division = 0.1 mm Stage micrometer.Or You Can Use This Formula..D2)3)4)5)Line up the eyepiece graticule and the stage micrometer.Each division on the stage micrometer is 0.1 mm long.At this magnification, 1 division on the stage micrometer is the same as 4.5 divisions on the eyepiece graticule.To work out the size of 1 division on the eyepiece graticule,you need to divide 0.1 by 4.5:1 division on eyepiece graticule = 0.1 4.5 = 0.022 mmSo if you look at a cell under the microscope at this magnificationand it\u2019s 4 eyepiece divisions long, you know it measures:4 x 0.022 = 0.088 mm. 1 11111111' i11i 111111 n 111\/ j 11111 u Z The eyepiece graticule will need to be Z - re-calibrated at different magnifications. -11111111111 n 111 m 11111111111 n i ii FIf you're given an image of cells under the microscope in the exam, you can calculate their actual size using this formula:Example: If the image of a cell measures 5 mm and the magnification is x 100, then the actual size of the cell will be: 5 \u2022*-100 = 0.05 mm.actual size =size of image magnificationArtefacts Can Get in the Way of Your Observations1) Artefacts are things that you can see down the microscope that aren't part of the cell or specimen that you're looking at.2) They can be anything from bits of dust, air bubbles and fingerprints, The new organelle Steveto inaccuracies caused by scjjashf^and staining your sample. had discovered looked just3) Artefacts are usually made during the preparation of your slides and shouldn't really be I'ke his thumb print, there at ail \u2014 you'll need to prepare your root tip cells carefully to avoid creating artefacts.Artefacts are especially common in electron micrographs because specimens need a lot of preparation before you can view them under an electron microscope. The first scientists to use these microscopes could only distinguish between artefacts and organelles by repeatedly preparing specimens in different ways.

Well now it's time to delve a little deeper...Membranes Control What Passes Through ThemAll cells are surrounded by membranes. In eukaryotic cells,many of the organelles are surrounded by membranes too.1)2)Cell-surface membranes surround cells. They are a barrier between the cell and its environment, controlling which substances enter and leave the cell. They're partially permeable \u2014 they let some molecules through but not others. Substances can move across the cell-surface membrane by diffusion, osmosis or active transport (see pages 38-43).The membranes around organelles divide the cell into different compartments \u2014 they act as a barrier between the organelle and the cytoplasm. They are also partially permeable and control what substances enter and leave the organelle.Cell Membranes have a Fluid Mosaic\u2019 StructurePartially permeable membranes can be useful at sea.The basic structure of all cell membranes is pretty much the same. They're composed of lipids (mainly phospholipids \u2014 see page 7), proteins and carbohydrates (attached to proteins or lipids).1)2)3)4)5)In 1972, the fluid mosaic model was suggested to describe the arrangement of molecules in the membrane.

They bind to the cholesterolhydrophobic tails of the phospholipids, causing them to pack more closely together.This restricts the movement of the phospholipids, making the membrane less fluid and more rigid.Cholesterol helps to maintain the shape of animal cells (which don't have cell walls). This is particularly important for cells that aren't supported by other cells, e.g. red blood cells, which float free in the blood.Topic 2B \u2014 Cell Membranes\n37Cell Membrane StructureThe Permeability of the Cell Membrane can be Investigated in the LabThe permeability of cell membranes is affected by different conditions, e.g. temperature and solvent concentration. You can investigate how these things affect permeability by doing an experiment using beetroot. Beetroot cells contain a coloured pigment that leaks out \u2014 the higher the permeability of the membrane, the more pigment leaks out of the cell. Here's how you could investigate how temperature affects beetroot membrane permeability:1) Use a scalpel to carefully cut five equal sized pieces of beetroot. (Make sure you do your cutting on a cutting board.) Rinse the pieces to remove any pigment released during cutting.2) Add the five pieces to five different test tubes, each containing 5 cm3 of water.Use a measuring cylinder or pipette to measure the water.3) Place each test tube in a water bath at a different temperature, e.g. 10 \u00b0C, 20 \u00b0C, 30 40 \u00b0C, 50 \u00b0C, for the same length of time (measured using a stopwatch).4) Remove the pieces of beetroot from the tubes, leaving just the coloured liquid.5) Now you need to use a colorimeter \u2014 a machine that passes light through the liquid and measures how much of that light is absorbed. The higher the absorbance, the more pigment released, so the higher the permeability of the membrane.6) You can connect the colorimeter to a computer and use software to collect the data and draw a graph of the results.\u00b0C,'ii 11 i 11 n ii 1111111,11111 ^- Colorimeters needr 5 minutes to stabilise before E- using and calibrating at zero -- by taking a measurement ~ ~ through pure water. \u2014\\ 11 i i ii n i ii j h 11 j n 111Increasing the Temperature Increases Membrane PermeabilityExperiments like the one above have shown that membrane permeability changes with temperature:(J) Temperatures below 0 \u00b0C \u2014 the phospholipids don't have much energy, so they can t move very much.

This continues until particles are evenly distributed throughout the liquid or gas.3) The concentration gradient is the path from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Particles diffuse down a concentration gradient4) Diffusion is a passive process \u2014 no energy is needed for it to happen.5) Particles can diffuse across cell membranes, as long as they can move freely through the membrane.111' h 1 I I I  I  I IF! , M,,,, (\/Polar molecules have Z ~ Partlal positive and negative ~ charges (see p. 20).

They're also non-polar, which makes them soluble in lipids, so they can dissolve in the hydrophobic bilayer.6) When molecules diffuse directly through a cell membrane, it's also known as simple diffusion.Facilitated Diffusion uses Carrier Proteins and Protein Channels1) Some larger molecules (e.g. amino acids, glucose) would diffuse extremely slowly through the phospholipid bilayer because they're so big.2) Charged particles, e.g. ions and polar molecules, would also diffuse slowly \u2014 that'sbecause they're water soluble, and the centre of the bilayer is hydrophobic (see page 36).3) So to speed things up, large or charged particles diffuse through carrier proteins or channel proteins in the membrane instead \u2014 this is called facilitated diffusion.4) Like diffusion, facilitated diffusion moves particles down a concentration gradient, from a higher to a lower concentration.5) It's also a passive process \u2014 it doesn't use energy.'fiAndy needed all his concentration for this particular gradient...Carrier proteins move large molecules across membranes, down their concentration gradient.

So the greater the number of channel or carrier proteins in the cell membrane, the faster the rate of facilitated diffusion.Having more channel proteins increases the rate of facilitated diffusion _____________Aquaporins are special channel proteins that allow the facilitated diffusion of waterthrough cell membranes.

First though, you need to make up several solutions of different, known concentrations to test the cylinders in. You can do this using a serial dilution technique:This is how you'd make five serial dilutions of a sucrose solution, starting with an initial sucrose concentration of 2 M and diluting each solution by a factor of 2...Line up five test tubes in a rack.r , You dont have to dilute '- Solutions by a factor of 2.

You now have 10 cm3 of solution that's half as concentrated as the solution in the first test tube (it's 1 M).4)Repeat this process three more times to create solutions of 0.5 M, 0.25 M and 0.125 M.10 cm of 2 M sucrose solution5 cm\" of distilled waterTopic 2B \u2014 Cell Membranes\n41Exchange Across Cell Membranes \u2014 OsmosisYou Can Also Make Solutions of Different Concentrations By Finding the Scale FactorYou can make sucrose solutions of any concentration by finding the scale factor.For example, if you want to make 15 cm3 of 0.4 M sucrose solution...1) Start with a solution of a known concentration, e.g. 1 M.2) Find the scale factor by dividing the concentration of this solution by the concentration ofthe solution you want to make. So in this case the scale factor = 1 M -=- 0.4 M = 2.5.3) This means that the solution you want to make is 2.5 times weaker than the one you have.To make the solution 2.5 times weaker, use 2.5 times less of it, i.e. 15 cm3 4 2.5 = 6 cm3.Transfer this amount to a clean test tube.4) Top up the test tube with distilled water to get the volume you want to make.In this case you want to make 15 cm3 of solution, so you need to add: 15-6 = 9 cm3 of distilled water.Use Your Solutions To Find the Water Potential of Potato Cells20 -101) Use a cork borer to cut potatoes into identically sized chips, about 1 cm in diameter.2) Divide the chips into groups of three and measure the mass of each group using a mass balance.3) Place one group into each of your sucrose solutions.4) Leave the chips in the solutions for at least 20 minutes(making sure that they all get the same amount of time).5) Remove the chips and pat dry gently with a paper towel6) Weigh each group again and record your results.7) Calculate the % change in mass for each group.8) Use the results to make a calibration curve, showing % change in mass against sucrose concentrationThe potato chips will gain water (and therefore mass) in solutions with a higher water potentialthan the chips, and lose water in solutions with a lower water potential.The point at which the curve crosses the x-axis (where the % change in mass is 0) is the point at which the waterpotential of the sucrose solution is the same as the water potential of the potato cells.

Infectious diseases can be really nasty, but luckily there's an army of cells in the body that helps lo protect us \u2014 the immune system.Foreign Antigens Trigger an Immune ResponseAntigens are molecules (usually proteins) that can generate an immune response when clctected by the body.They arc usually found on the surface of cells and are used by the immune system to identify: pathogens (organisms that cause disease), abnormal body cells (e.g. cancerous or pathogen-infected cells, which have abnormal antigens on their surface), toxins and cells from other individuals of the same species (e.g. organ transplants).There are four main stages in the immune response:(T) Phagocytes Engulf PathogensA phagocyte (e.g. a macrophage) is a type of white blood cell that carries out phagocytosis (engulfment of pathogens). They're found in the blood and in tissues and are the first cells to respond to an immune system trigger inside the body. Here's how they work:1) A phagocyte recognises the foreign antigens on a pathogen.2) The cytoplasm of the phagocyte moves round the pathogen, engulfing it.3) The pathogen is now contained in a phagocytic vacuole (a bubble) in the cytoplasm of the phagocyte.4) A lysosome (an organelle that contain enzymes called lysozymes) fuses with the phagocytic vacuole. The lysozymes break down the pathogen.5) The phagocyte then presents the pathogen's antigens \u2014 it sticks the antigens on its surface to activate other immune system cells.nucleuscytoplasmlysosomeantigens on surface ofphagocyte engulfs the pathogenlysosome fuses with phagocytic vacuole(2) Phagocytes Activate T-cellsA T-cell {also called a T-lymphocyte) is another type of white blood cell. It has receptor proteins on its surface that bind to complementary antigens presented to it by phagocytes. This activates the T-cell. Different types of T-cells respond in different ways. For example, helper T-cells {TH cells) release chemical signals that activate and stimulate phagocytes and cytotoxic T-cells (Tc cells), which kill abnormal and foreign cells B-cells, which secrete antibodies (see below).Th cells also activate(3) T-cells Activate B-cells, Which Divide into Plasma CellsB-cells (also called B-lymphocytes) are also a type of white blood cell. They're covered with antibodies \u2014 proteins that bind antigens to form an antigen-antibody complex. Each B-cell has a different shaped antibody on its membrane, so different ones bind to different shaped antigens.1) When the antibody on the surface of a B-cell meets a complementary shaped antigen, it binds to it.2) This, together with substances released from helper T-cells, activates the B-cell. This process is called clonal selection.3) The activated B-cell divides into plasma cells.(V) Plasma Cells Make More Antibodies to a Specific AntigenPlasma cells are identical to the B-cell (they're clones). They secrete loads of antibodies specific to the antigen. These are called monoclonal antibodies. They bind to the antigens on the surface of the pathogen to form lots of antigen-antibody complexes,An antibody has two binding sites, so can bind to two pathogens at the same time. This means that pathogens become clumped together \u2014 this is called agglutination. Phagocytes then bind to the antibodies and phagocytose many pathogens at once. This process leads to the destruction of pathogens carrying this antigen in the body.variableregions(orange)constan regions (blue)heavychainAntibodies are proteins \u2014 they're made up of chains of amino acids.The specificity of an antibody depends on its variable regions, which form the antigen binding sites. Each antibody has a variable region with a unique tertiary structure {due to different amino acid sequences) that's complementary to one specific antigen. All antibodies have the same constant regions.Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n45The Immune SystemThe Immune Response Can be Split into Cellular and HumoralJust to add to your fun, the immune response is split into two \u2014 the cellular response and the humoral response.1) Cellular \u2014 The T-cells and other immune system cells that they interact with, e.g. phagocytes, form the cellular response.2) Humoral \u2014 B-cells, clonal selection and the production of monoclonal antibodies form the humoral response.Both types of response are needed to remove a pathogen from the body and the responses interact with each other, e.g. T-cells help to activate B-cells, and antibodies coat pathogens making it easier for phagocytes to engulf them.The Immune Response for Antigens can be MemorisedThe Primary Immune ResponseNeil's primary response \u2014 to his parents.1) When an antigen enters the body for the first time it activates the immune system. This is called the primary response.2) The primary response is slow because there aren't many B-cells that can make the antibody needed to bind to it.3) Eventually the body will produce enough of the right antibody to overcome the infection. Meanwhile the infected person will show symptoms of the disease.4) After being exposed to an antigen, both T- and B-cells produce memory cells. These memory cells remain in the body for a long time. Memory T-cells remember the specific antigen and will recognise it a second time round. Memory B-cells record the specific antibodies needed to bind the antigen.5) The person is now immune \u2014 their immune system has the ability to respond quickly to a second infection.The Secondary Immune Response1)2)3)If the same pathogen enters the body again,the immune system will produce a quicker, strongerimmune response \u2014 the secondary response.Clonal selection happens faster. Memory B-cells areactivated and divide into plasma cells that produce the right antibody to the antigen. Memory T-cells are activated and divide into the correct type of T-cells to kill the cell carrying the antigen.The secondary response often gets rid of the pathogen before you begin to show any symptoms (you are immune to the pathogen).Practice QuestionsQ1 What are antigens?Q2 What does the humoral response involve?

They just hang around a lot longer than most T-cells and B-cells. When the antigen enters the body for a second time they can immediately divide into more of the specific T-cells and B-cells that can kill the pathogen or release antibodies against it.Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","28":"46Immunity and VaccinesThe primary response gives us immunity against a disease, but only after you've become infected. If only there was a way to stimulate memory cell production without getting the disease... well, there is \u2014 vaccination.Vaccines can Protect Individuals and Populations Against Disease1) While your B-cells are busy dividing to build up their numbers to deal with a pathogen (i.e. the primary response \u2014 see previous page), you suffer from the disease. Vaccination can help avoid this.2) Vaccines contain antigens that cause your body to produce memory cells against a particular pathogen, without the pathogen causing disease. This means you become immune without getting any symptoms.3) Vaccines protect individuals that have them and, because they reduce the occurrence of the disease, those not vaccinated are also less likely to catch the disease (because there are fewer people to catch it from). This is called herd immunity.4) Vaccines always contain antigens \u2014 these may be free or attached to a dead or attenuated (weakened) pathogen.5) Vaccines may be injected or taken orally. The disadvantages of taking a vaccine orally are that it could be broken down by enzymes in the gut or the molecules of the vaccine may be too large to be absorbed into the blood.6) Sometimes booster vaccines are given later on (e.g. after several years) to make sure that memory cells are produced.Antigenic Variation Helps Some Pathogens Evade the Immune System1) Antigens on the surface of pathogens activate the primary response.2) When you're infected a second time with the same pathogen (which has the same antigens on its surface) they activate the secondary response and you don't get ill.3) However, some sneaky pathogens can change their surface antigens. This antigen variability is called antigenic variation. (Different antigens are formed due to changes in the genes of a pathogen.)4) This means that when you're infected for a second time, the memory cells produced from the first infection will not recognise the different antigens. So the immune system has to start from scratch and carry out a primary response against these new antigens.5) This primary response takes time to get rid of the infection, which is why you get ill again.6) Antigenic variation also makes it difficult to develop vaccines against some pathogens for the same reason. Examples of pathogens that show antigenic variation include HIV and the influenza virus.7) Here's how antigenic variation affects the production of vaccines to help prevent people catching influenza:1) The influenza (flu) vaccine changes every year. That's because the antigens on the surface of the influenza virus change regularly, forming new strains of the virus.2) Memory cells produced from vaccination with one strain of the flu will not recognise other strains with different antigens. The strains are immunologically distinct.3) Every year there are different strains of the influenza virus circulating in the population, so a different vaccine has to be made.4) New vaccines are developed and one is chosen every year that is the most effective against the recently circulating influenza viruses.5) Governments and health authorities then implement a programme of vaccination using the most suitable vaccine.1st infection\n2nd infectiondifferent antigensThe oral vaccine was proving hard to swallow.\nTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n47Immunity and VaccinesImmunity can be Active or PassiveACTIVE IMMUNITYThis is the type of immunity you get when your immune system makes its own antibodies after being stimulated by an antigen. There are two different types of active immunity:1) Natural \u2014 this is when you become immune after catching a disease.2) Artificial \u2014 this is when you become immune after you've been given a vaccination containing a harmless dose of antigen.PASSIVE IMMUNITYThis is the type of immunity you get from being given antibodies made by a different organism\u2014 your immune system doesn't produce any antibodies of its own. Again, there are two types:1) Natural \u2014 this is when a baby becomes immune due to the antibodies it receives from its mother, through the placenta and in breast milk.2) Artificial \u2014 this is when you become immune after being injected with antibodies from someone else. E.g. If you contract tetanus you can be injected with antibodies against the tetanus toxin, collected from blood donations.Active and Passive Immunity Have Contrasting CharacteristicsIn the exam you might be asked about the differences between these types of immunity:Active immunityPassive immunityRequires exposure to antigenDoesn't require exposure to antigenIt takes a while for protection to developProtection is immediateMemory cells are producedMemory cells aren't producedProtection is long-term because the antibody is produced (after activation of memory cells) in response to complementary antigen being present in the bodyProtection is short-term because the antibodies given are broken downPractice QuestionsQ1 How do vaccines cause immunity?Q2 Explain what antigenic variability is.Exam QuestionsQ1 Vaccines can be used to protect people against some diseases. Not all individuals in a population must receive the vaccine for a vaccination programme to be successful. Explain why this is the case.Q2 The influenza virus causes the flu. Explain why it is possible to suffer from the flu more than once.Q3 Immunity from a disease can be either active or passive.a) Explain why active immunity offers long-term protection against a disease, whereas passive immunity only offers protection in the short-term.b) It normally takes 14 days for immunity to develop after receiving a vaccine.Explain why vaccines do not usually offer immediate protection against a disease.An injection of dead bugs \u2014 roll on mv next vaccine...The influenza virus is so clever that it would almost make you think it had a mind of its own. I mean, as soon as we catch up with it and develop a vaccine, off it goes and changes its surface antigens again. Influenza virus: one, humans: nil.

Let's all give three cheers for antibodies. Without them, we'd all probably be dead by now.Monoclonal Antibodies can be used to Target Specific Substances or Cells1) Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies produced from a single group of genetically identical B-cells(plasma cells). This means that they're all identical in structure.2) As you know, antibodies are very specific because their binding sites have a unique tertiary structure (see p.44) that only one particular antigen will fit into (one with a complementary shape).3) You can make monoclonal antibodies that bind to anything you want, e.g. a cell antigen or other substance, and they will only bind to (target) this molecule.EXAMPLE: Targeting drugs to a particular cell type \u2014 cancer cells1) Different cells in the body have different surface antigens.2) Cancer cells have antigens called tumour markers that are not found on normal body cells.3) Monoclonal antibodies can be made that will bind to the tumour markers.4) You can also attach anti-cancer drugs to the antibodies.5) When the antibodies come into contact with the canccr cells they will bind to the tumour markers.6) This means the drug will only accumulate in the body where there are cancer cells.7) So, the side effects of an antibody-based drug are lower than other drugs because they accumulate near specific cells.monoclonalantibodyantigen binding siteanti-cancer drugdrug attached to antibodyantibody binds to tumour markers on cancer cellcell-surface antigen\/\\----------------------------No0No------------------------------------------------------------\u2014L\nnormal body cell tumour marker cancer cellEXAMPLE: Targeting a particular substance for medical diagnosis \u2014 pregnancy testingPregnancy tests detect the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) that's found in the urine of pregnant women:1) The application area contains antibodies for hCG bound to a coloured bead (blue).2) When urine is applied to the application area any hCG will bind to the antibody on the beads, forming an antigen-antibody complex.3) The urine moves up the stick to the test strip, carrying any beads with it.4) The test strip contains antibodies to hCG that are stuck in place (immobilised).5) If there is hCG present the test strip turns blue because the immobilised antibody binds to any hCG \u2014 concentrating the hCG-antibody complex with the blue beads attached.If no hCG is present, the beads will pass through the test area without binding to anything, and so it won't go blue.coloured bead antibody \u00a9 ^ to hCGhCG\nappflow of liquidIimmobilised antibody to hCGication areatest stripTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n49Antibodies in MedicineThe ELISA Test is a Medical Diagnostic Test that Uses Antibodies1) The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) allows you to see if a patient has any antibodies to a certain antigen (see example below) or any antigen to a certain antibody.2) It can be used to test for pathogenic infections, for allergies (e.g. to nuts or lactose) and for just about anything you can make an antibody for.3) In an ELISA test, an antibody is used which has an enzyme attached to it. This enzyme can react with asubstrate to produce a coloured product. This causes the solution in the reaction vessel to change colour.4) If there's a colour change, it demonstrates that the antigen or antibody of interest is present in the sample being tested (e.g. blood plasma). In some types of ELISA, the quantity of this antigen\/antibody can be worked out from the intensity of the colour change.5) There are several different types of ELISA. Direct ELISA uses a single antibody that is complementary to the antigen you're testing for. Indirect ELISA is different because it uses two different antibodies.This method is outlined below:EXAMPLE: Using an ELISA as a HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) TestAn indirect ELISA test can be used to see if a patient possesses antibodies to the HIV virus:0 HIV antigen is bound to the bottom of a well in a well plate (a plastic tray with loads of little circular pits in it).\u00a9 A sample of the patient's blood plasma, which might contain several different antibodies, is added to the well.If there are any HIV-specific antibodies (i.e. antibodies against HIV) these will bind to the HIV antigen stuck to the bottom of the well. The well is then washed out to remove any unbound antibodies.(3) A secondary antibody, that has a specific enzyme attached to it, is added to the well.This secondary antibody can bind to the HIV-specific antibody (which is also called the primary antibody).The well is washed out again to remove any unbound secondary antibody. If there's no primary antibody in the sample, all of the secondary antibody will be washed away.(?) A solution is added to the well. This solution contains a substrate, which is able to react with the enzyme attached to the secondary antibody and produce a coloured product. If the solution changes colour, it indicates that the patient has HIV-specific antibodies in their blood and is infected with HIV.antibody specific to HIV antigenantibody not specific to HIV antigenHIVantigensecondary antibody with attached enzymecolour change = HIV is present (positive result)wash out 1= 0vXwash out(T) HIV antigen bound to bottom of the well(2) plasma sample added@ secondary antibody added(J) substrate addeds\\l I II II II II II I I I II I I I I i M II 11 \\ I I I I I I I I I I i H I I II M I II i II I I I I I I I i it I I\/, ~ The washing steps are important to make sure unbound antibodies aren't left in 3 5 the well which could affect the results.

For example, people with asthma produce too many of a type of antibody that causes inflammation in the lungs. Monoclonal antibodies can be made to bind this type of antibody, so it can no longer cause inflammation, which can reduce the asthma symptoms.Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","30":"52HIV and VirusesViruses aren't cells like bacteria. They're not even living things \u2014 they can only reproduce inside the cells of another organism (called the host). All viruses cause disease, and you need to know all about one particularly nasty blighter...HIV is the Virus That Causes AIDS1) HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that affects the immune system.It eventually leads to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).2) AIDS is a condition where the immune system deteriorates and eventually fails. This makes someone with AIDS more vulnerable to other infections, like pneumonia (see next page).3) HIV infects (and eventually kills) helperT-cells, which act as the host cells (see p. 28) for the virus. Remember, helper T-cells send chemical signals that activate phagocytes, cytotoxic T-cells and B-cells (see p. 44) so they're hugely important cells in the immune response. Without enough helper T-cells, the immune system is unable to mount an effective response to infections because other immune system cells don't behave how they should.4) People infected with HIV develop AIDS when the helper T-cell numbers in their body reach a critically low level.HIV has a Spherical StructureYou might get asked about the structure of HIV in your exam1) A core that contains the genetic material (RNA) and some proteins (including the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is needed for virus replication).2) An outer coating of protein called a capsid.3) An extra outer layer called an envelope. This is made of membrane stolen from the cell membrane of a previous host cell.4) Sticking out from the envelope are loads of copies of an attachment protein that help HIV attach to thehost helper T-cell.HIV Replicates Inside its Host\u2019s Helper T-CellsHIV (and all other viruses) can only reproduce inside the cells of the organism it has infected. HIV replicates inside the helper T-cells of the host. It doesn't have the equipment (such as enzymes and ribosomes) to replicate on its own, so it uses those of the host cell.Here's how HIV replicates:1) The attachment protein attaches to a receptor molecule on the cell membrane of the host helper T-cell.2) The capsid is released into the cell, where it uncoats and releases the genetic material (RNA) into the cell's cytoplasm.3) Inside the cell, reverse transcriptase is used to make a complementary strand of DNA from the viral RNA template (see p. 16-17 for more on DNA and RNA).4) From this, double-stranded DNA is made and inserted into the human DNA.5) Host cell enzymes are used to make viral proteins from theviral DNA found within the human DNA.6) The viral proteins are assembled into new viruses, which bud from the cell and go on to infect other cells.During the initial infection period, HIV replicates rapidly and the infected person may experience severe flu-likesymptoms. After this period, HIV replication drops to a lower level. This is the latency period. During the latency period (which can last for years), the infected person won't experience any symptoms.Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\u00a9HIVhelper T cellDNA\u00a9\u00aev \u201c \u201c  DAttachment protein CapsidS1 , \" \"........................u-n,,,,,._ ttachnient proteins can also -EnvelopeGeneticmaterialReverse transcriptase\n53HIV and VirusesPeople with AIDS are Susceptible to a Range of IllnessesPeople with HIV are classed as having AIDS when symptoms of their failing immune system start to appear or their helper T-cell count drops below a certain level. People with AIDS generally develop diseases that wouldn't cause serious problems in people with a healthy immune system. The length of time between infection with HIV and the development of AIDS varies between individuals but without treatment it's usually around 10 years.1) The initial symptoms of AIDS include minor infections of mucous membranes (e.g. the inside of the nose, ears and genitals), and recurring respiratory infections.2) As AIDS progresses the number of immune system cells decreases further.Patients become susceptible to more serious infections including chronic diarrhoea, severe bacterial infections and tuberculosis.3) During the late stages of AIDS patients have a very low number of immune system cells and can develop a range of serious infections such as toxoplasmosis of the brain (a parasite infection) and candidiasis of the respiratory system (fungal infection). It's these serious infections that kill AIDS patients, not HIV itself.M r11\" M 1,1 \"ii\/- ^ infections become -Z m\u00b0J and \u2122ore serious = r 93 there are fewer and - mmune system ~\u00ab!'s to them.

Factors that affect progression of HIV to AIDS and survival time with AIDS include existing infections, the strain of HIV they're infected with, age and access to healthcare.Antibiotics Don\u2019t Work Against Viruses1) Antibiotics kill bacteria by interfering with their metabolic reactions.They target the bacterial enzymes and ribosomes used in these reactions.2) Bacterial enzymes and ribosomes are different from human enzymes and ribosomes. Antibiotics are designed to only target the bacterial ones so they don't damage human cells. Makes sense.3) Viruses don't have their own enzymes and ribosomes \u2014 they use the ones in the host's cells. So becausehuman viruses use human enzymes and ribosomes to replicate, antibiotics can't inhibit them because theydon't target human processes.4) Most antiviral drugs are designed to target the few virus-specific enzymes (enzymes that only the virus uses) that exist. For example, HIV uses reverse transcriptase to replicate (see previous page). Human cells don't use this enzyme so drugs can be designed to inhibit it without affecting the host cell. These drugs are called reverse-transcriptase inhibitors.There\u2019s No Cure for HIV1) There's currently no cure or vaccine for HIV but antiviral drugs can be used to slow down the progression of HIV infection and AIDS in an infected person.2) The best way to control HIV infection in a population is by reducing its spread. HIV can be spread via unprotected sexual intercourse, through infected bodily fluids (e.g. like blood from sharing contaminated needles) and from a HIV-positive mother to her fetus. Not all babies from HIV-positive mothers are born infected with HIV and taking antiviral drugs during pregnancy can reduce the chance of the baby being HIV-positive.Practice Questions- V testing, based on HIV '- anybody detection, before a =- baby is 18 months old can be \u00a3 \u00a3 inaccurate.

The diffusion rate is quick because of the small distances the substances have to travel (see p. 39).2) In multicellular animals, diffusion across the outer membrane is too slow, for two reasons:\u2022 Some cells are deep within the body \u2014 there's a big distance between them and the outside environment.\u2022 Larger animals have a low surface area to volume ratio \u2014 it's difficult to exchange enough substances to supply a large volume of animal through a relatively small outer surface.So rather than using straightforward diffusion to absorb and excrete substances, multicellular animals need specialised exchange organs (like lungs \u2014 see p. 58).They also need an efficient system to carry substances to and from their individual cells \u2014 this is mass transport.In mammals, 'mass transport' normally refers to the circulatory system (see p. 70), which uses blood to carry glucose and oxygen around the body. It also carries hormones, antibodies (p. 44) and waste like CO,.Mass transport in plants involves the transport of water and solutes in the xylem and phloem (see pages 78 and 80).Topic 3 A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n55Size and Surface AreaBody Size and Shape Affect Heat ExchangeAs well as creating waste products that need to be transported away, the metabolic activity inside cells creates heat. Staying at the right temperature is difficult, and it's pretty heavily influenced by your size and shape...SizeThe rate of heat loss from an organism depends on its surface area. If an organism has a large volume, e.g. a hippo, its surface area is relatively small. This makes it harder for it to lose heat from its body. If an organism is small, e.g. a mouse, its relative surface area is large, so heat is lost more easily. This means smaller organisms need a relatively high metabolic rate, in order to generate enough heat to stay warm.Shape1) Animals with a compact shape have a small surface area relative to their volume\u2014 minimising heat loss from their surface.2) Animals with a less compact shape (those that are a bit gangly or have sticky outy bits) have a larger surface area relative to their volume \u2014 this increases heat loss from their surface.3) Whether an animal is compact or not depends on the temperature of its environment. Here's an example:Arctic fox Body temperature 37 \u00b0C Average outside temperature O \u00b0C\u2022X*The Arctic fox has small ears and a round head to reduceits SA : V ratio and heat loss.African bat-eared fox Body temperature 37 \u00b0C Average outside temperature 25 \u00b0CThe African bat-eared fox has large ears and a more pointed nose to increase its SA : V ratio and heat loss.European fox Body temperature 37 \u00b0C Average outside temperature 12 \u00b0Ct* 4The European fox is intermediate between the two, matching the temperature of its environment.Organisms have Behavioural and Physiological Adaptations to Aid ExchangeNot all organisms have a body size or shape to suit their climate \u2014 some have other adaptations instead...1) Animals with a high SA : volume ratio tend to lose more water as it evaporates from their surface.Some small desert mammals have kidney structure adaptations so that they produce less urine to compensate.2) To support their high metabolic rates, small mammals living in cold regions need to eat large amounts of high energy foods such as seeds and nuts.3) Smaller mammals may have thick layers of fur or hibernate when the weather gets really cold.4) Larger organisms living in hot regions, e.g. elephants and hippos, find it hard to keep cool as their heat loss is relatively slow. Elephants have developed large flat ears to increase their surface area, allowing them to lose more heat. Hippos spend much of the day in the water \u2014 a behavioural adaptation to help them lose heat.Practice QuestionsQ1 Give four things that organisms need to exchange with their environment.Q2 Describe how body shape affects heat exchange.Exam QuestionQl Explain why a small mammal needs a relatively high metabolic rate compared to a large mammal.

Use dissecting scissors or a scalpel to make the cut. If using a scalpel, cut downwards (not towards you) and don't apply too much pressure to the blade.Continue cutting down one of the bronchi. You should be able to see the bronchioles branching off.Cut off a piece of the lung. The tissue will feel spongy because of the air trapped in all the alveoli.Lungs from a butcher are safe for humans to handle, but they could still contain bacteria that cause food poisoning. That's why it's important to wash your hands after the dissection and disinfect work surfaces.Here\u2019s How to Dissect Fish Gills in Bony Fish1) Again, make sure you're wearing an apron or lab coat.2) Place your chosen fish (something like a perch or salmon works well) in a dissection tray or on a cutting board.3) Gills are located on either side of the fish's head. They're protected on eachside by a bony flap called an operculum and supported by gill arches.4) To remove the gills, push back the operculum and use scissors to carefully remove the gills. Cut each gill arch through the bone at the top and bottom. They should look a bit like this:5) If you look closely, you should be able to see the gill filaments.N\\\/1 I II I i \/1 I I II I M I I II I II 11 u u 111 i ii I I II I M II I i u I II I II II n I I I I I I I I I 11^- For more nformation about the structure and function of fish gills, see page 56. - 1 w n 11 H ' i u 11 h 11 h 11111111 m i m i m 111 m 111 ii m i w i m 11 m w n ^A single gill archoperculum (the gills are under here)\ngill filamentsTopic 3 A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n65Dissecting Gas Exchange SystemsYou Can Dissect the Gaseous Exchange System in Insects tooBig insects like grasshoppers or cockroaches are usually best for dissecting because they're easier to handle.

Here are some points to think about:1) Some people argue that it is morally wrong to kill animals just for dissections, as it is unnecessary killing. However many dissections that are carried out in schools involve animals that have already been killed for their meat, e.g. the sheep's lung dissection on the previous page. (Some people disagree with killing animals altogether though.)2) There are concerns that the animals used for dissections are not always raised in a humane way \u2014 they may be subject to overcrowding, extremes of temperature or lack of food \u2014 and they may not be killed humanely either. If animals (e.g. insects) are raised in school for dissection, it's important to make sure they are looked after properly and killed humanely to minimise any suffering or distress.Practice QuestionsQ1 Why is it important that dissecting tools are sharp?Q2 Describe how to remove the gills in a bony fish.Exam QuestionsQ1 A student is examining grasshopper tracheae under the microscope.

As you might imagine, this involves loads of different chemical reactions and our old friends, enzymes.Food is Broken Down into Smaller Molecules During Digestion1) The large biological molecules (e.g. starch, proteins) in food are too big to cross cell membranes.This means they can't be absorbed from the gut into the blood.2) During digestion, these large molecules are broken down into smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, amino acids), which can move across cell membranes. This means they can be easily absorbed from the gut into the blood, to be transported around the body for use by the body cells.3) You might remember from Topic 1 A, that most large biological molecules are polymers, which can be broken down into smaller molecules (monomers) using hydrolysis reactions.Hydrolysis reactions break bonds by adding water.4) During hydrolysis, carbohydrates are broken down into disaccharides and then monosaccharides.Fats are broken down into fatty acids and monoglycerides. Proteins are broken down into amino acids.Digestive Enzymes are Used to Break Down Biological Molecules in Food1) A variety of different digestive enzymes are produced by specialised cells in the digestive systems of mammals. These enzymes are then released into the gut to mix with food.2) Since enzymes only work with specific substrates (see page 11), different enzymes are needed to catalyse the breakdown of different food molecules.Carbohydrates are Broken Down by Amylase and Membrane-Bound Disaccharidases1) Amylase is a digestive enzyme that catalyses the conversion of starch (a polysaccharide) into the smaller sugar maltose (a disaccharide). This involves the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds in starch.2) Amylase is produced by the salivary glands (which release amylase into the mouth) and also by the pancreas (which releases amylase into the small intestine).3) Membrane-bound disaccharidases are enzymes that are attached to the cell membranes of epithelial cellslining the ileum (the final part of the small intestine). They help to break down disaccharides (e.g. maltose, sucrose and lactose) into monosaccharides (e.g. glucose, fructose and galactose). Again, this involves the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds.<v\\u i \" i J1111111111 \/ I i, l I I I 11111,~ There s more on polysaccharides, tl ~ disaccharides and monosaccharides \u2014- on pages 2-5. \"\/> 111111' 11 n w i \/ it 1111111111 n4) Monosaccharides can be transported across the cell membranes of the ileum epithelial cells via specific transporter proteins (see next page).DisaccharideDisaccharidaseMonosaccharide Productsmaltosemaltaseglucose + glucosesucrosesucraseglucose + fructoselactoselactaseglucose + galactoseLipids are Broken Down by Lipase (with the Help of Bile Salts)1) Lipase enzymes catalyse the breakdown of lipids into monoglycerides and fatty acids. This involves the hydrolysis of the ester bonds in lipids.2) Lipases are made in the pancreas. They work in the small intestine.3) Bile salts are produced by the liver and emulsify lipids \u2014 this means they cause the lipids to form small droplets.4) Bile salts are really important in the process of lipid digestion. Several small lipid droplets have a bigger surface area than a single large droplet (for the same volume of lipid). So the formation of small droplets greatly increases the surface area of lipid that's available for lipases to work on.\u00a3 monoglyceride is a C- glycerol molecule with \u00a3 ~ one fatty acid attached =\nemulsificationbile saltsbiglipid dropletA \/V,\/ lipase digestion\u00b0o\u00b0of lipidsmall lipid dropletsmonoglycerides & fatty acids \u00b00\u00b0\u00b00 micelles5) Once the lipid has been broken down, the monoglycerides and fatty acids stick with the bile salts to form tiny structures called micelles.Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n67Digestion and AbsorptionProteins are Broken Down by Endopeptidases and ExopeptidasesProteins are broken down by a combination of different proteases (or peptidases). These are enzymes that catalyse the conversion of proteins into amino acids by hydrolysing the peptide bonds between amino acids.You need to know about endopeptidases and exopeptidases (including dipeptidases):Endopeptidases act to hydrolyse peptide bonds within a protein. '' L11111!'''11 ['11111' n 11 it-r ^ \u2019 7 r r 1 r Remember: endopeptidases -Trypsin and chymotrypsin are two examples of endopeptidases. r break bonds inside the protein -They're synthesised in the pancreas and secreted into the small intestine.

It's released into the stomach by cells in the stomach lining.Pepsin only works in acidic conditions \u2014 these are provided by hydrochloric acid in the stomach.Exopeptidases act to hydrolyse peptide bonds at the ends of protein molecules.They remove single amino acids from proteins.Dipeptidases are exopeptidases that work specifically on dipeptides. They act to separate the two amino acids that make up a dipeptide by hydrolysing the peptide bond between them.Dipeptidases are often located in the cell-surface membrane of epithelial cells in the small intestine.The Products of Digestion are Absorbed Across Cell MembranesThe products of digestion are absorbed across the ileum epithelium into the bloodstream.Monosaccharides\u2022 Glucose is absorbed by active transport with sodium ions via a co-transporter protein(see page 43). Galactose is absorbed in the same way using the same co-transporter protein.\u2022 Fructose is absorbed via facilitated diffusion through a different transporter protein.Monoglycerides and fatty acidsMicelles (see previous page) help to move monoglycerides and fatty acids towards the epithelium. Because micelles constantly break up and reform they can 'release' monoglycerides and fatty acids, allowing them to be absorbed \u2014 whole micelles are not taken up across the epithelium. Monoglycerides and fatty acids are lipid-soluble, so can diffuse directly across the epithelial cell membrane.Amino acidsAmino acids are absorbed in a similar way to glucose and galactose. Sodium ions are actively transported out of the epithelial cells into the ileum itself. They then diffuse back into the cells through sodium-dependent transporter proteins in the epithelial cell membranes, carrying the amino acids with them.Practice QuestionsQ1 What is the function of amylase in digestion?Q2 Describe the role of bile salts in lipid digestion.Exam QuestionQ1 Some people suffer from lactose intolerance.This can be caused by an inability to break down lactose in the upper small intestine.a) Suggest which disaccharidase enzyme is deficient or missing in people who are lactose-intolerant.

There's a lot to take in here but as long as you break it clown a bit (ha, just like digestion) then it's not too bad. You can't escape learning what all the enzymes act on, but helpfully their names are usually linked to what they do \u2014 maltase breaks down maltose, dipeptidases break down dipeptides.

As well as being found in all vertebrates, haemoglobin is found in earthworms, starfish, some insects, some plants and even in some bacteria.Haemoglobin Saturation Depends on the Partial Pressure of Oxygen1) The partial pressure of oxygen (p02) is a measure of oxygen concentration.The greater the concentration of dissolved oxygen in cells, the higher the partial pressure.2) Similarly, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pC02) is a measure of the concentration of CO, in a cell.3) Haemoglobin's affinity for oxygen varies depending on the partial pressure of oxygen:Oxygen loads onto haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin where there's a hi;Oxyhaemoglobin unloads its oxygen where there's a lower p02.4) Oxygen enters blood capillaries at the alveoli in the lungs. Alveoli have a high p02 so oxygen loads onto haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin.5) When cells respire, they use up oxygen \u2014 this lowers the pOr Red blood cells deliver oxyhaemoglobin to respiring tissues, where it unloads its oxygen6) The haemoglobin then returns to the lungs to pick up more oxygen.There was no use pretending \u2014 the partial pressure of CH., had just increased, and Keith knew who was to blame.Dissociation Curves Show How Affinity for Oxygen VariesA dissociation curve shows how saturated the haemoglobin is with oxygen at any given partial pressure.slll I I M M I III W I I I I I I II I \/\/,- 100% saturation means C- every haemoglobin molecule f~ is carrying the maximum -- of 4 molecules of oxygen. \u2014'\/1 I II I I M I II II M J 1 I II I I I IX\\U I I I II H I I I M I II M I I I M I l\/y- 0% saturation means none 3r of the haemoglobin molecules 5are carrying any oxygen. -\"'n I I M I i w I I I I II II 11 n I I 11The graph is 'S-shaped' because when haemoglobin (Hb) combines with the first 02 molecule, its shape alters in a way that makes it easier for other molecules to join too. But as the Hb starts to become saturated, it gets harder for more oxygen molecules to join. As a result, the curve has a steep bit in the middle where it's really easy for oxygen molecules to join, and shallow bits at each end where it's harder. When the curve is steep, a small change in p02 causes a big change in the amount of oxygen carried by the Hb.D.'Sg.o.g^i.p.D..Cv.rve,fpr..A<jM.ltHuman Haemoglobin\n\u201cI----1------1----r2 4 6 8 10partial pressure of 02 \/ kPaWhere p02 is high (e.g. in the lungs), haemoglobin has a high affinity for oxygen (i.e. it will readily combine with oxygen), so it has a high saturation of oxygen.Where p02 is low (e.g. in respiring tissues), haemoglobin has a low affinity for oxygen, which means it releases oxygen rather than combines with it. That's why it has a low saturation of oxygen.\nTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n69HaemoglobinCarbon Dioxide Concentration Affects Oxygen UnloadingTo complicate matters, haemoglobin gives up its oxygen more readily at higher partial pressures of carbon dioxide (pC02).It's a cunning way of getting more oxygen to cells during activity. \u00a7ku- x1) When cells respire they produce carbon dioxide, \u00b0 ^which raises the pCOr % *2) This increases the rate of oxygen unloading (i.e. the rate Jj ^at which oxyhaemoglobin dissociates to form haemoglobin ^and oxygen) \u2014 so the dissociation curve 'shifts' right.The saturation of blood with oxygen is lower for a given p02, meaning that more oxygen is being released.3) This is called the Bohr effect.Haemoglobin is Different in Different OrganismsDifferent organisms have different types of haemoglobin with different oxygen transporting capacities. Having a particular type of haemoglobin is an adaptation that helps the organism to survive in a particular environment.1) Organisms that live in environments with a low concentration of oxygen have haemoglobin with a higher affinity for oxygen than human haemoglobin \u2014 the dissociation curve is to the left of ours.2) Organisms that are very active and have a high oxygen demand have haemoglobin with a lower affinity for oxygen than human haemoglobin \u2014 the curve is to the right of the human one.A = animal living in depleted oxygen environment, e.g. a lugworm.B = animal living at high altitude where the partial pressure ofoxygen is lower, e.g. a llama in the Andes.C = human dissociation curve.D = active animal with a high respiratory rate living where there's plenty of available oxygen, e.g. a hawk.of oxygen \/ kPaPractice QuestionsQ1 How many oxygen molecules can each haemoglobin molecule carry?Q2 Where in the body would you find a low partial pressure of oxygen?Q3 Why are oxygen dissociation curves S-shaped?Exam QuestionQI a) Haemoglobin is a protein with a quaternary structure.Explain what this means.

Most multicellular organisms (mammals, insects, fish) have a circulatory system of some type.The Circulatory System is a Mass Transport System1) Multicellular organisms, like mammals, have a low surface area to volume ratio (see p. 54), so they need a specialised transport system to carry raw materials from specialised exchange organs to their body cells \u2014 this is the circulatory system.2) The circulatory system is made up of the heart and blood vessels.3) The heart pumps blood through blood vessels (arteries,arterioles, veins and capillaries) to reach different parts of the body.

The inner lining (endothelium) is folded, allowing the artery to stretch \u2014 this also helps it to maintain high pressure.

Veins contain valves to stop the blood flowing backwards. Blood flow through the veins is helped by contraction of the body muscles surrounding them. All veins carry deoxygenated blood (because oxygen has been used up by body cells), except for the pulmonary veins, which carry oxygenated blood to the heart from the lungs.Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n77The Circulatory SystemSubstances are Exchanged between Blood and Body Tissues at CapillariesArterioles branch into capillaries, which are the smallest of the blood vessels. Substances (e.g. glucose and oxygen) are exchanged between cells and capillaries, so they're adapted for efficient diffusion.1) They're always found very near cells in exchange tissues (e.g. alveoli in the lungs), so there's a short diffusion pathway.2) Their walls are only one cell thick, which also shortens the diffusion pathway.3) There are a large number of capillaries, to increase surface area for, n k) exchange. Networks of capillaries in tissue are called capillary beds.Tissue Fluid is Formed from BloodTissue fluid is the fluid that surrounds cells in tissues. It's made from small molecules that leave the blood plasma, e.g. oxygen, water and nutrients. (Unlike blood, tissue fluid doesn't contain red blood cells or big proteins, because they're too large to be pushed out through the capillary walls.) Cells take in oxygen and nutrients from the tissue fluid, and release metabolic waste into it. In a capillary bed, substances move out of the capillaries, into the tissue fluid, by pressure filtration:1) At the start of the capillary bed, nearest the arteries, the hydrostatic (liquid) pressure inside the capillaries is greater than the hydrostatic pressure in the tissue fluid.2) This difference in hydrostatic pressure means an overall outward pressure forces fluid out of the capillaries and into the spaces around the cells, forming tissue fluid.3) As fluid leaves, the hydrostatic pressure reduces in the capillaries\u2014 so the hydrostatic pressure is much lower at the venule end of the capillary bed (the end that's nearest to the veins).4) Due to the fluid loss, and an increasing concentration of plasma proteins (which don't leave the capillaries), the water potential at the venule end of the capillary bed is lower than the water potential in the tissue fluid.5) This means that some water re-enters the capillaries from the tissue fluid at the venule end by osmosis (see p. 40 for more on osmosis).Blood ___!from arteriolecapillary bed\nwaterAny excess tissue fluid is drained into the lymphatic system(a network of tubes that acts a bit like a drain), which transports this excessfluid from the tissues and dumps it back into the circulatory system.Practice Questions11111\" 11111 n 111 m 111 a i \/\/\/- High blood pressure means a high :- hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries, -- which can lead to an accumulation 2 ^ of tissue fluid in the tissues.\" 111 n I I M I II I I | n I II I | I I i | | | m\\<\"Q1 Name all the blood vessels entering and leaving the heart.Q2 List four types of blood vessel.Q3 Explain why water returns to the capillary at the venule end of the capillary bed.Exam QuestionsQl Describe two structural features of an artery and explain how each feature relates to its function.[4 marks]Q2 At the arteriole end of a capillary bed the hydrostatic pressure is 5.1 kPa in a capillary and 0.13 kPa in the spacearound the cells.

The right side only needs to get blood to the lungs, which are nearby.2) The ventricles have thicker walls than the atria, because they have to push blood out of the heart whereas the atria just need to push blood a short distance into the ventricles.3) The atrioventricular (AV) valves link the atria to the ventricles and stop blood flowing back into the atria when the ventricles contract.4) The semi-lunar (SL) valves link the ventricles to the pulmonary artery and aorta, and stop blood flowing back into the heart after the ventricles contract.5) The cords attach the atrioventricular valves to the ventricles to stop them being forced up into the atria when the ventricles contract.Captain Jeff reckoned the lock gates were just like a big heart valve \u2014 with enough pressure he would be able to force his way through.The valves only open one way \u2014 whether they're open or closed depends on the relative pressure of the heart chambers.If there's higher pressure behind a valve, it's forced open, but if pressure is higher in front of the valve it's forced shut. This means blood only flows in one direction through the heart.higherlowerpressurepressureJLlowerhigherpressurepressurevalve closedvalve openTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n73The HeartThe Cardiac Cycle Pumps Blood Round the BodyThe cardiac cycle is an ongoing sequence of contraction and relaxation of the atria and ventricles that keeps blood continuously circulating round the body. The volume of the atria and ventricles changes as they contract and relax. Pressure changes also occur, due to the changes in chamber volume (e.g. decreasing the volume of a chamber by contraction will increase the pressure in a chamber). The cardiac cycle can be simplified into three stages:\u00a9 ( Ventricles relax, atria contract )The ventricles are relaxed.The atria contract, decreasing the volume of the chambers and increasing the pressure inside the chambers. This pushes the blood into the ventricles. There's a slight increase in ventricular pressure and chamber volume as the ventricles receive the ejected blood from the contracting atria.\u00a9AtriaSL valves closed\nAV valves are open\\ \/( Ventricles contract, atria relax )The atria relax. The ventricles contract (decreasing their volume), increasing their pressure. The pressure becomes higher in the ventricles than the atria, which forces the AV valves shut to prevent back-flow. The pressure in the ventricles is also higher than in the aorta and pulmonary artery, which forces open the SL valves and blood is forced out into these arteries.\\ \/(Ventricles relax, atria relax\")The ventricles and the atria both relax.The higher pressure in the pulmonary artery and aorta closes the SL valves to prevent back-flow into the ventricles. Blood returns to the heart and the atria fill again due to the higher pressure in the vena cava and pulmonary vein. In turn this starts to increase the pressure of the atria. As the ventricles continue to relax, their pressure falls below the pressure of the atria and so the AV valves open.

It's very important, so unsurprisingly, you need to know how it works. You'll find that these pages definitely get to the heart of it... groan.The Heart Consists of Two Muscular Pumps1) The diagram on the right shows the internal structure of the heart.2) The right side pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs and the left side pumps oxygenated blood to the whole body.3) Note \u2014 the left and right sides are reversed on the diagram, cos it's the left and right of the person that the heart belongs to.l I | I lit 11 I I II I II I I II 11 u ii \" m ~ The diagram is a good reminder ~- that veins carry blood into the heart ~ \u00a3 (vena cava and pulmonary vein) and -- arteries carry blood away from it ~- (pulmonary artery and aorta). ~ -7\/ | I I \\ I II \/ 1 11 I II 1 I M I I I I I I I M 1 M \\ssuperior vena cavainferior vena cavaright atriumsemi-lunar valverightatrioventricular valvepulmonaryveinleft atrium semi-lunar valve^ left atrioventricular valvecords (valve tendons)rightventricleleft ventricleYou Need to Know What the Different Parts of the Heart DoEach bit of the heart is adapted to do its job effectively.1) The left ventricle of the heart has thicker, more muscular walls than the right ventricle, because it needs to contract powerfully to pump blood all the way round the body. The right side only needs to get blood to the lungs, which are nearby.2) The ventricles have thicker walls than the atria, because they have to push blood out of the heart whereas the atria just need to push blood a short distance into the ventricles.3) The atrioventricular (AV) valves link the atria to the ventricles and stop blood flowing back into the atria when the ventricles contract.4) The semi-lunar (SL) valves link the ventricles to the pulmonary artery and aorta, and stop blood flowing back into the heart after the ventricles contract.5) The cords attach the atrioventricular valves to the ventricles to stop them being forced up into the atria when the ventricles contract.Captain Jeff reckoned the lock gates were just like a big heart valve \u2014 with enough pressure he would be able to force his way through.The valves only open one way \u2014 whether they're open or closed depends on the relative pressure of the heart chambers.If there's higher pressure behind a valve, it's forced open, but if pressure is higher in front of the valve it's forced shut. This means blood only flows in one direction through the heart.higherlowerpressurepressureJLlowerhigherpressurepressurevalve closedvalve openTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n73The HeartThe Cardiac Cycle Pumps Blood Round the BodyThe cardiac cycle is an ongoing sequence of contraction and relaxation of the atria and ventricles that keeps blood continuously circulating round the body. The volume of the atria and ventricles changes as they contract and relax. Pressure changes also occur, due to the changes in chamber volume (e.g. decreasing the volume of a chamber by contraction will increase the pressure in a chamber). The cardiac cycle can be simplified into three stages:\u00a9 ( Ventricles relax, atria contract )The ventricles are relaxed.The atria contract, decreasing the volume of the chambers and increasing the pressure inside the chambers. This pushes the blood into the ventricles. There's a slight increase in ventricular pressure and chamber volume as the ventricles receive the ejected blood from the contracting atria.\u00a9AtriaSL valves closed\nAV valves are open\\ \/( Ventricles contract, atria relax )The atria relax. The ventricles contract (decreasing their volume), increasing their pressure. The pressure becomes higher in the ventricles than the atria, which forces the AV valves shut to prevent back-flow. The pressure in the ventricles is also higher than in the aorta and pulmonary artery, which forces open the SL valves and blood is forced out into these arteries.\\ \/(Ventricles relax, atria relax\")The ventricles and the atria both relax.The higher pressure in the pulmonary artery and aorta closes the SL valves to prevent back-flow into the ventricles. Blood returns to the heart and the atria fill again due to the higher pressure in the vena cava and pulmonary vein. In turn this starts to increase the pressure of the atria. As the ventricles continue to relax, their pressure falls below the pressure of the atria and so the AV valves open. This allows blood to flow passively (without being pushed by atrial contraction) into the ventricles from the atria. The atria contract, and the whole process begins again.pulmonaryu n 111 w 1111 r I H \/~ Cardiac contraction \u2014 \u201c is also called systole IT- and relaxation is - called diastole. ~\nblood leaves via pulmonary arteryVentriclescontractSL valves forced openblood leaves via aorta\nAV valves forced closed\nAtria and ventriclesrelaxblood re-enters via vena cavaSL valves forced closedblood re-enters via pulmonaryAV valves forced openThere's a bit about interpreting cardiac cycle data on the next page.

The LDL cholesterol levelwas measured for each woman.

The relative risk of a cardiovascular event, adjusted for other factors that can affect cardiovascular disease, was then calculated.Here are some of the things you might be asked to do:1) Describe the data \u2014 The relative risk of a cardiovascular eventincreases as the level of LDL cholesterol in the blood increases.2) Draw conclusions \u2014 The graph shows a positivecorrelation between the relative risk of a cardiovascular event and the level of LDL cholesterol in the blood.3) Check any conclusions are valid \u2014Make sure any conclusions match the data, e.g.\u2022 This data only looked at women \u2014 no males were involved, so you can't say that this trend is true for everyone.\u2022 You can't say that a high LDL cholesterol level is correlated with an increased risk of heart attacks, because the data shows all first cardiovascular events, including surgery on coronary arteries.\u2022 Also, you can't conclude that a high LDL cholesterol level caused the increased relative risk of a cardiovascular event \u2014 there may be other reasons for the trend.4) Other things to think about \u2014 A large sample size was used (27 939). Data based on large samples is better than data based on small samples. This is because a large sample is more representative of the whole population (i.e. it shares more of the various characteristics of the population).>97.6 >115.4 >132.2-115.4 -132.2 -153.9 Level of LDL cholesterol in blood \/ mg dl'4111111111 m 1111 \/111111 ^ There's more on correlation z \u201c and cause on page 213. -^1 u 11 w 111111111 n 111; 111'>153.9\nYou might also have to evaluate conflicting evidence associated with risk factors affecting cardiovascular disease.

When you consider the movement of water, it's all about the xylem. It's pretty exciting stuff...Two Types of Tissue are Involved in Transport in Plants1) Xylem tissue transports water and mineral ions in solution.These substances move up the plant from the roots to the leaves.2) Phloem tissue transports organic substances like sugars (also in solution) bothup and down the plant \u2014 there's more about the phloem on pages 80-81.3) Xylem and phloem are mass transport systems (see page 54) \u2014 they move substances over large distances.Xylem vessels are the part of the xylem tissue that actually transports the water and ions. Xylem vessels are very long, tube-like structures formed from dead cells (vessel elements) joined end to end.

This is because the stomata open when it gets light to let in CO, for photosynthesis. When it's dark the stomata are usually closed, so there's little transpiration.2) Temperature \u2014 the higher the temperature the faster the transpiration rate. Warmer water molecules have more energy so they evaporate from the cells inside the leaf faster. This increases the concentration gradient between the inside and outside of the leaf, making water diffuse out of the leaf faster.3) Humidity \u2014 the lower the humidity, the faster the transpiration rate (i.e. there's a negative correlationbetween humidity and transpiration rate). If the air around the plant is dry, the concentration gradient between the leaf and the air is increased, which increases transpiration.4) Wind \u2014 the windier it is, the faster the transpiration rate. Lots of air movement blows away water molecules from around the stomata. This increases the concentration gradient, which increases the rate of transpiration.water evaporatestension<3 cohesiong) water enters\nTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n79Transport in Plants \u2014 XylemA Potometer can be Used to Estimate Transpiration RateA potometer is a special piece of apparatus used to estimate transpiration rates. It actually measures water uptake by a plant, but it's assumed that water uptake by the plant is directly related to water loss by the leaves. You can use it to estimate how different factors affect the transpiration rate.Here's what you'd do:Cut a shoot underwater to prevent air from entering the xylem. Cut it at a slant to increase the surface area available for water uptake.Assemble the potometer in water and insert the shoot underwater, so no air can enter.Remove the apparatus from the water but keep the end of the capillary tube submerged in a beaker of water. Check that the apparatus is watertight and airtight.Dry the leaves, allow time for the shoot to acclimatise, and then shut the tap.Remove the end of the capillary tube from the beaker of water until one air bubble has formed, then put the end of the tube back into the water.Record the starting position of the air bubble.Start a stopwatch and record the distance moved by the bubble per unit time, e.g. per hour. The rate of air bubble movement is an estimate of the transpiration rate.Remember, only change one variable (e.g. temperature) at a time. All other conditions (e.g. light, humidity) must be kept constant.You Might Have to Dissect PlantsYou can look at xylem or phloem in plant tissue (e.g. part of a plant stem) under a microscope, and then draw them. But first you need to dissect the plant and prepare a section of the tissue. You can do this using the following method:1) Use a scalpel (or razor blade) to cut a cross-section of the stem. Cut the sections as thinly as possible \u2014 thin sections are better for viewing under a microscope.2) Use tweezers to gently place the cut sections in water until you come to use them. This stops them from drying out.3) Transfer each section to a dish containing a stain, e.g. toluidine blue O (TBO), and leave for one minute. TBO stains the lignin in the walls of the xylem vessels blue-green.This will let you see the position of the xylem vessels and examine their structure.4) Rinse off the sections in water and mount each one onto a slide (see page 30).Practice QuestionsQ1 What is the function of xylem tissue?Q2 Give four factors that affect transpiration rate.Q3 Name a piece of apparatus used to measure transpiration rate.Exam QuestionQ1 a) What is meant by the term transpiration?

I know,; I almost can't contain my excitement. When it comes to the phloem it's all about moving dissolved organic substances around the plant, so it's a bit different to xylem.Phloem Tissue is Adapted for Transporting Solutes1) Solutes are dissolved substances. Phloem tissue transports solutes (mainly sugars like sucrose) round plants. Like xylem, phloem is formed from cells arranged in tubes.2) Sieve tube elements and companion cells are important cell types in phloem tissue:\u2022 Sieve tube elements are living cells that form the tube for transporting solutes. They have no nucleus and few organelles, so...\u2022 ...there's a companion cell for each sieve tube element. They carry out living functions for sieve cells, e.g. providing the energy needed for the active transport of solutes.Translocation is the Movement of Solutes1) Translocation is the movement of solutes (e.g. sugars like sucrose, and amino acids) to where they're needed in a plant. Solutes are sometimes called assimilates.2) It's an energy-requiring process that happens in the phloem.3) Translocation moves solutes from 'sources' to 'sinks'. The source of a solute is where it's made (so it's at a high concentration there). The sink is the area where it's used up (so it's at a lower concentration there).E.g. the source for sucrose is usually the leaves (where it's made), and the sinks are the other parts of the plant, especially the food storage organs and the meristems {areas of growth) in the roots, stems and leaves.4) Enzymes maintain a concentration gradient from the source to the sink by changing the solutes at the sink (e.g. by breaking them down or making them into something else). This makes sure there's always a lower concentration at the sink than at the source.E.g. in potatoes, sucrose is converted to starch in the sink areas, so there's always a lower concentration of sucrose at the sink than inside the phloem. This makes sure a constant supply of new sucrose reaches the sink from the phloem.The Mass Flow Hypothesis Best Explains Phloem TransportScientists still aren't certain exactly how the solutes are transported from source to sink by translocation. The best supported theory is the mass flow hypothesis:1) Active transport (see p. 42) is used to actively load the solutes (e.g. sucrose from photosynthesis) from companion cells into the sieve tubes of the phloem at the source (e.g. the leaves).2) This lowers the water potential inside the sieve tubes, so water enters the tubes by osmosis from the xylem and companion cells.3) This creates a high pressure inside the sieve tubes at the source end of the phloem.1) At the sink end, solutes are removed from the phloem to be used up.2) This increases the water potential inside the sieve tubes, so water also leaves the tubes by osmosis.3) This lowers the pressure inside the sieve tubes.(j) SOURCElow water potential, high pressurewater flow solute flow\u00a9sieve plate plasmodesma\u2014Water flows to xylem(2) SINK high water potential,\u00ae1) The result is a pressure gradient from the source end to the sink end.

The fluid from the bulge has a higher concentration of sugars than the fluid from below the ring \u2014 this is evidence that there's a downward flow of sugars.A radioactive tracer such as radioactive carbon (l4C) can be used to track the movement of organic substances in a plant (see below).Pressure in the phloem can be investigated using aphids (they pierce the phloem, then their bodies are removed leaving the mouthparts behind, which allows the sap to flow out... gruesome). The sap flows out quicker nearer the leaves than further down the stem \u2014 this is evidence that there's a pressure gradient.If a metabolic inhibitor (which stops ATP production) is put into the phloem, then translocation stops \u2014 this is evidence that active transport is involved.Sugar travels to many different sinks, not just to the one with the highest water potential, as the model would suggest._\\W \" I \/1 1 M I 11 H I ll \/; | \/ f 11 i \/11 11\/You could get asked about '__ correlations and casual relationships \u0000TU \u2022 | 4 I I , . , r, .

One example is carbon dioxide containing the radioactive isotope 14C. This radioactively-labelled COcan be supplied to a single leaf by being pumped into a container which completely surrounds the leaf.2) The radioactive carbon will then be incorporated into organic substances produced by the leaf (e.g. sugars produced by photosynthesis), which will be moved around the plant by translocation.3) The movement of these substances can be tracked using a technique called f^^,e,(; iS: autoradiography. To reveal where the radioactive tracer has spread to in a plant, the plant is killed (e.g. by freezing it using liquid nitrogen) and then the whole plant (or sections of it) is placed on photographic film\u2014 the radioactive substance is present wherever the film turns black.4) The results demonstrate the translocation of substances from source to sink over time \u2014 for example, autoradiographs of plants killed at different times show an overall movement of solutes (e.g. products of photosynthesis) from the leaves towards the roots.Autoradiograph of plant showing how radioactivity has spread from the leaf.Practice QuestionsLeaf exposed to MCO. gasQ1 According to the mass flow hypothesis, how is a pressure gradient set up in the phloem?Exam QuestionQ1 A scientist is investigating where the products of photosynthesis are translocated to in a plant.

Chromosomes are found in the nucleus.The DNA molecule is really long so, it has to be wound up so it can fit into the nucleus.The DNA molecule is wound around proteins called histones.Histone proteins also help to support the DNA.The DNA (and protein) is then coiled up very tightly to make a compact chromosome.DNA double-helixDNA Histone proteins A single chromosomeDNA wound around histone proteinsDNA with the protein is coiled up repeatedly= Eukary\u00b0t'c cells include - Z a\"'\u2122al and p|ant ce|)s r r \u201cr\u00b0karyotir cells are -My bacteria. =1111 111 111 i\\\\~6)The mitochondria and chloroplasts in eukaryotic cells also have their own DNA.

It's the order of bases in a gene that determines the order of amino acids in a particular polypeptide.4) Each amino acid is coded for by a sequence of three bases in a gene called a triplet, i :-^5s>5) To make a polypeptide, DNA is first copied into messenger RNA (mRNA).This is the first stage of protein synthesis (see p. 84).6) Genes that don't code for a polypeptide code for functional RNA instead.

These sections of DNA are called introns.There can be several introns within a gene.All the bits or a gene that do code for amino acids are called exons.Introns are removed during protein synthesis \u2014 so they don't affect the amino acid order. Their purpose isn't known for sure. (Prokaryotic DNA doesn't have introns.)Eukaryotic DNA also contains regions of multiple repeats outside of genes.These are DNA sequences that repeat over and over.

These forms are called alleles.2) The order of bases in each allele is slightly different, so they code for slightly different versions of the same polypeptide. For example, the gene that determines blood type exists as one of three alleles \u2014 one determines type O, another type A and the other type B.In a eukaryotic cell nucleus, DNA is stored as chromosomes.Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, 46 in total \u2014 two number 1s, two number 2s, two number 3s, etc. Pairs of matching chromosomes (e.g. the 1s) are called homologous pairs.In a homologous pair, both chromosomes are the same size and have the same genes, although they could have different alleles.

Uracil always pairs with adenine during protein synthesis. RNA isn't all the same though. You need to know about:(Messenger RNA (mRNA))mRNA is made during transcription (see below). It carries the genetic code from the DNA to the ribosomes, where it's used to make a protein during translation (see next page). mRNA is a single ^ Basepolynucleotide strand.In mRNA, groups of three adjacent bases are usually called codons (they're sometimes Phosphate called triplets or base triplets).

Cells that divide by meiosis are diploid to start with, but the cells that are formed from meiosis are haploid \u2014 the chromosome number halves. Without meiosis, you'd get double the number of chromosomes when the gametes fused. Not good.1) Before meiosis starts, the DNA unravels and replicates so there are two copies of each chromosome, called chromatids.2) The DNA condenses to form double-armed chromosomes, each made from two sister chromatids. The sister chromatids are joined in the middle by a centromere.3) Meiosis I (first division) \u2014 the chromosomes arrange themselves into homologous pairs4) These homologous pairs are then separated, halving the chromosome number.5) Meiosis II (second division) \u2014 the pairs of sister chromatids that make up each chromosome are separated (the centromere is divided).6) Four haploid cells (gametes) that are genetically different from each other are producedIn the exams, you might need to spot when meiosis happens in an organism with a life cycle you haven't seen before, e.g. an insect or plant. Just remember (hat in any organism, meiosis is needed for sexual reproduction because it produces daughter cells (gametes) with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell.You might also be told how many chromosomes are in a parent cell, then asked to complete diagrams showing how many chromosomes will be in the daughter cells after the first and second divisions of meiosis. Remember that the chromosome number is halved during the first division.A Note About Homologous Pairs: Humans have 46 chromosomes in total \u2014 23 pairs.

This produces genetically identical daughter cells \u2014 unlike meiosis.Topic 4B \u2014 Diversity, Classification and Variation\n","47":"88Topic 4B \u2014 Diversity, Classification and VariationMeiosis and Genetic VariationAhh, now on to some really exciting stuff \u2014 the production of gametes (sex cells to you and me).This is how we end up different from our parents and our siblings \u2014 and yet, in some ways, strangely alike...DNA from One Generation is Passed to the Next by GametesHaploid nucleus (n) withEgg(gamete)1) Gametes are the sperm cells in males and egg cells in females. They join together at fertilisation to form a zygote, which divides and develops into a new organism.2) Normal body cells have the diploid number (2n) of chromosomes \u2014 meaning each cell contains two of each chromosome, one from the mum and one from the dad.3) Gametes have a haploid (n) number of chromosomes \u2014 there's only one copy of each chromosome.4) At fertilisation, a haploid sperm fuses with a haploid egg, making a cell with the normal diploid number of chromosomes. Half these chromosomes are from the father (the sperm) and half are from the mother (the egg).5) During sexual reproduction, any sperm can fertilise any egg \u0000 produces zygotes with different combinations of chromosomes to both parents. This mixing of genetic materialin sexual reproduction increases genetic diversity within a species (there's more on genetic diversity on page 92).2 nfertilisation is random. Random fertilisationGametes are Formed by MeiosisMeiosis is a type of cell division. It takes place in the reproductive organs. Cells that divide by meiosis are diploid to start with, but the cells that are formed from meiosis are haploid \u2014 the chromosome number halves. Without meiosis, you'd get double the number of chromosomes when the gametes fused. Not good.1) Before meiosis starts, the DNA unravels and replicates so there are two copies of each chromosome, called chromatids.2) The DNA condenses to form double-armed chromosomes, each made from two sister chromatids. The sister chromatids are joined in the middle by a centromere.3) Meiosis I (first division) \u2014 the chromosomes arrange themselves into homologous pairs4) These homologous pairs are then separated, halving the chromosome number.5) Meiosis II (second division) \u2014 the pairs of sister chromatids that make up each chromosome are separated (the centromere is divided).6) Four haploid cells (gametes) that are genetically different from each other are producedIn the exams, you might need to spot when meiosis happens in an organism with a life cycle you haven't seen before, e.g. an insect or plant. Just remember (hat in any organism, meiosis is needed for sexual reproduction because it produces daughter cells (gametes) with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell.You might also be told how many chromosomes are in a parent cell, then asked to complete diagrams showing how many chromosomes will be in the daughter cells after the first and second divisions of meiosis. Remember that the chromosome number is halved during the first division.A Note About Homologous Pairs: Humans have 46 chromosomes in total \u2014 23 pairs. One chromosome in each pair came from mum and one from dad, e.g. there are two number 1's (one from mum and one from dad), two number 2s etc. The chromosomes that make up each pair are the same size and have the same genes. although they could have different versions of those genes (called alleles).

This produces genetically identical daughter cells \u2014 unlike meiosis.Topic 4B \u2014 Diversity, Classification and Variation\n90Meiosis and Genetic VariationChromosome Mutations are Caused by Errors in Cell Division1) In humans, when meiosis works properly, all four daughter cells will end up with 23 whole chromosomes \u2014 one from each homologous pair (1 to 23).2) But sometimes meiosis goes wrong and the cells produced contain variations in the numbers of whole chromosomes or parts of chromosomes.3) For example, two cells might have 23 whole chromosomes, one each of 1 to 23, but the other two might get a bit muddled up, one having two chromosome 6's and the other no chromosome 6.4) This is called chromosome mutation and is caused by errors during meiosis.5) Chromosome mutations lead to inherited conditions because the errors are present in the gametes (the hereditary cells).One type of chromosome mutation is called non-disjunction \u2014 it's a failure of the chromosomes to separateproperly. In humans, non-disjunction of chromosome 21 during meiosis can lead to Down's Syndrome.Chromosome 211) Down's syndrome is caused by a person having an extra copy of chromosome 21 (or sometimes an extra copy of part of chromosome 21).2) Non-disjunction means that chromosome 21 fails to separate properly during meiosis, so one cell gets an extra copy of 21 and another gets none3) When the gamete with the extra copy fuses to another gamete at fertilisation, the resulting zygote will have three copies of chromosome 21.Non-disjunction occurs \u2014 homologous pair fails to separate.xVmu i M n- Non-disjunction t.\u2014 can also occur \u2014in meiosis II. \u2014\/1 ii r n ii' i1111sFertilisation \u20223 copies of chromosome 21ZygotePractice QuestionsQ1 Explain what is meant by the terms haploid and diploid.Q2 What happens to the chromosome number at fertilisation?Q3 What is a chromatid?Q4 Give three ways in which the outcome of meiosis differs from the outcome of mitosis.Exam QuestionsQ1 Drosophila (fruit flies) only have four chromosomes.The diagram on the right summarises meiosis in Drosophila.a) Complete the diagram to show the chromosomes in the four daughter cells.

The key thing to understand is that meiosis produces four genetically different haploid (n) daughter cells.

Check. Brain switched on. Check. Cuppa piping hot. Check. Sweets on standby. Check. Okay, I think you're all sorted to start photosynthesis. Finally, take a deep breath and here we go...Photosynthesis Takes Place in the Chloroplasts of Plant Cells1) Chloroplasts are flattened organelles surrounded by a double membrane. They are found in plant cells.2) Thylakoids (fluid-filled sacs) are stacked up in the chloroplast into structures called grana (singular = granum).The grana are linked together by bits of thylakoid membrane called lamellae (singular = lamella).4) Chloroplasts contain photosynthetic pigments (e.g. chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotene). These are coloured substances that absorb the light energy needed for photosynthesis. The pigments are found in the thylakoid membranes \u2014 they're attached to proteins. The protein and pigment is called a photosystem.5) There are two photosystems used by plants to capture light energy.Photosystem I (or PSI) absorbs light best at a wavelength of 700 nm and photosystem II (PSII) absorbs light best at 680 nm.6) Contained within the inner membrane of the chloroplast and surrounding the thylakoids is a gel-like substance called the stroma. It contains enzymes, sugars and organic acids.7) Carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis and not used straight away are stored as starch grains in the stroma.outer memb'aneinner membrane stromathylakoid thylakoidmembrane lamellagranum(thylakoidcf arHPhotosynthesis can be Split into Two StagesThere are actually two stages that make up photosynthesis:crsmmammmm________cn- See p.' 108 for \\oad% more* * ' \u20141) As the name suggests, this reaction needs light energy.2) It takes place in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts.3) Here, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll (and other photosynthetic pigments) in the photosystems. The light energy excites the electrons in the chlorophyll, leading to their eventual release from the molecule.The chlorophyll has been photoionised.4) Some of the energy from the released electrons is used to add a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP, and some is used to reduce NADP to form reduced NADP. ATP transfers energy and reduced NADP transfers hydrogen to the light-independent reaction.5) During the process H^O is oxidised to 02.The Light-Independent Reaction1) This is also called the Calvin cycle and as the name suggests it doesn't use light energy directly. (But it does rely on the products of the light-dependent reaction.)2) It takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast.3) Here, the ATP and reduced NADP from the light-dependent reaction supply the energy and hydrogen to make simple sugars from CO,.\nIn the Light-Dependent Reaction ATP is Made by PhotophosphorylationIn the light-dependent reaction, the energy resulting from the photoionisation of chlorophyll is used for three things:1) Making ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. This reaction is called photophosphorylation (see p. 105).2) Making reduced NADP from NADP.3) Splitting water into protons (H+ ions), electrons and oxygen. This is called photolysis (see p. 105).The light-dependent reaction actually includes two types of photophosphorylation \u2014 non-cyclic and cyclic.Each of these processes has different products (see next page).Topic 5A \u2014 Photosynthesis and RespirationThis diagram shows how the two reactions link together in the chloroplast.thylakoid membrane Q.< c 0 ,e\n107PhotosynthesisNon-cyclic Photophosphorylation Produces ATP, Reduced NADP and O,To understand the process you need to know that the photosystems (in the thylakoid membranes) are linked by electron carriers. Electron carriers are proteins that transfer electrons. The photosystems and electron carriers form an electron transport chain \u2014 a chain of proteins through which excited electrons flow. All the processes in the diagrams are happening together \u2014 I've just split them up to make it easier to understand.1 ) Light energy excites electrons in chlorophyll jLight energy is absorbed by PSII.The light energy excites electrons in chlorophyll.The electrons move to a higher energy level (i.e. they have more energy).These high-energy electrons are released from the chlorophyll and move down the electron transport chain to PSI.LIGHT electron carrierthylakoidmembranetPSIiriiide the thylakoid1\/600 1s J*1, P7003^) Energy from the excited electrons makes ATP...)The excited electrons lose energy as they move down the electron transport chain.This energy is used to transport protons into the thylakoid. so that the thylakoid has a higher concentration of protons than the stroma.

Now you've enjoyed that poem, it's time to concentrate. I hope you like remembering reactions involved in respiration, because these pages have several.There are Two Types of Respiration1) The two types of respiration are aerobic (requires oxygen) and anaerobic (doesn't require oxygen).2) Both produce ATP (see p. 104), although anaerobic respiration produces less.3) Both start with the process of glycolysis (see below). The stages after glycolysis differ.Glycolysis Makes Pyruvate from Glucose1) Glycolysis involves splitting one molecule of glucose (with 6 carbons \u2014 6C) into two smaller molecules of pyruvate (3C).2) The process happens in the cytoplasm of cells.3) Glycolysis is the first stage of both aerobic and anaerobic respiration and doesn't need oxygen to take place \u2014 so it's an anaerobic process.There are Two Stages in Glycolysis Phosphorylation and OxidationFirst, ATP is used to phosphorylate glucose to triose phosphate. Overall there's a net gain of 2 ATP and 2 reduced NAD.Stage One \u2014 Phosphorylation]1) Glucose is phosphorylated using a phosphate from a molecule of ATP.This creates 1 molecule of glucose phosphate and 1 molecule of ADP.2) ATP is then used to add another phosphate, forming hexose bisphosphate.3) Hexose bisphosphate is then split into 2 molecules of triose phosphate.1) Triose phosphate is oxidised(loses hydrogen), forming 2 molecules of pyruvate.2) NAD collects the hydrogen ions, forming 2 reduced NAD.3) 4 ATP are produced, but 2 were used up in stage one, so there's a net gain of 2 ATP.ATPADPThen triose phosphate is oxidised, releasing ATP.glucoseDHnumber of carbons in the moleculeglucose phosphate |6C|ATPADPZ)Hhexose bisphosphate12 x triose phosphate4ATP2 NAD\n2 reduced NADIn aerobic respiration...1) The two molecules of reduced NAD go to oxidative phosphorylation \u2014 see page 116.2) The two pyruvate molecules are actively transported intothe matrix of the mitochondria for the link reaction (see the next page).In Anaerobic Respiration Pyruvate is Converted to Ethanol or LactateIn anaerobic respiration, the pyruvate produced in glycolysis is converted into ethanol (in plants and yeast) or lactate (in animal cells and some bacteria) using reduced NAD:Alcoholic Fermentation reducedCO.- NAD NADLactate Fermentation reduced NAD NADpyruvateethanalUethanolpyruvateylactate (lactic acid)The production of ethanol or lactate regenerates oxidised NAD.

Here's what happens next...The Link Reaction converts Pyruvate to Acetyl Coenzyme A1) Pyruvate is decarboxylated (one carbon atom is removed from pyruvate in the form of C02).2) Pyruvate is oxidised to form acetate and NAD is reduced to form reduced NAD.3) Acetate is combined with coenzyme A (CoA) to form acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA).4) No ATP is produced in this reaction.coenzyme A (CoA) \u201cpyruvate|3C|co?

When a phosphate group is directly transferred from one molecule to another it's called substrate-level phosphorylation.

This movement drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pj).6) This process of ATP production driven by the movement of H+ ions across a membrane (due to electrons moving down an electron transport chain) is called chemiosmosis (which is described by the chemiosmotic theory).7) In the mitochondrial matrix, at the end of the transport chain, the protons, electrons and 02 (from the blood) combine to form water.Oxygen is said to be the final electron acceptor.outer mitochondrial membrane intermembrane space inner mitochondrial membrane ---------------%---------------------High H\u2019 concentration H+ H+ H+ HH+ H+ H+\u2022P,H+Low H* concentrationATPATP synthaseTopic 5 A \u2014 Photosynthesis and Respiration\n777Aerobic Respiration32 ATP Can be Made from One Glucose MoleculeAs you know, oxidative phosphorylation makes ATP using energy from the reduced coenzymes\u2014 2.5 ATP are made from each reduced NAD and 1.5 ATP are made from each reduced FAD.The table on the right shows how much ATP a cell can make from one molecule of glucose in aerobic respiration.

They can affect how proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation or the Krebs cycle function, reducing ATP production.2) This may cause anaerobic respiration to increase, to try and make up some of the ATP shortage.3) This results in lots of lactate being produced, which can cause muscle fatigue and weakness.4) Some lactate will also diffuse into the bloodstream, leading to high lactate concentrations in the blood.Other Respiratory Substrates Can also be Used in Aerobic RespirationIt's not just glucose that can be used as the substrate in aerobic respiration. Some products resulting from the breakdown of other molecules, such as fatty acids from lipids and amino acids from proteins, can be converted into molecules that are able to enter the Kreb's cycle (usually acetyl CoA).Practice QuestionsQ1 Where in the cell does glycolysis occur?Q2 Is glycolysis an anaerobic or aerobic process?Q3 How many ATP molecules are used up in glycolysis?Q4 What are the products of the link reaction?Q5 Where in the cell does the Krebs cycle occur?Q6 How many times does decarboxylation happen during one turn of the Krebs cycle?Q7 What do the electrons lose as they move along the electron transport chain in oxidative phosphorylation?Exam QuestionsQlAt the end of a 100 m sprint, runners will have built up lactate in their muscle cells.a) Name the reduced coenzyme regenerated by lactate production.[1 mark]b) What is the advantage for the runner of producing lactate in anaerobic respiration?[2 marks]02Carbon monoxide inhibits the final electron carrier in the electron transport chain.a) Explain how this affects ATP production via the electron transport chain.[2 marks]b) Explain how this affects ATP production via the Krebs cycle.[2 marks]Q3Describe how a 6-carbon molecule of glucose is converted to pyruvate.[6 marks]The electron transport chain isn\u2019t just a FAD with the examiners...Oh my gosh, I didn't think it could get any worse...

This is because there are more positive ions outside the cell than inside.2) So the membrane is polarised \u2014 there's a difference in charge (called a potential difference or voltage) across it.3) The voltage across the membrane when it's at rest is called the resting potential \u2014 it's about-70 mV (millivolts).4) The resting potential is created and maintained by sodium-potassium pumpsand potassium ion channels in a neurone's membrane: \u0000 >\u2022 The sodium-potassium pumps move sodium ions out of the neurone, but the membrane isn't permeable to sodium ions, so they can't diffuse back in. This creates a sodium ion electrochemical gradient (a concentration gradient of ions) because there are more positive sodium ions outside the cell than inside.\u2022 The sodium-potassium pumps also move potassium ions in to the neurone, but the membrane is permeable to potassium ions so they diffuse back out through potassium ion channels.\u2022 This makes the outside of the cell positively charged compared to the inside.^ 111 n u 111 ii i it 1111111 n u 111111 ii i ii 11111111 it 1111111 n t- Z The sodium-potassium pump, potassium ion channel and sodium -- ion channel (see below) are all types of transport protein.

If the stimulus is big enough, it'l trigger a rapid change in potential difference.

This makes the inside of the neurone less negative.Depolarisation \u2014 if the potential difference reaches the threshold (around -55 mV), more sodium ion channels open. More sodium ions diffuse rapidly into the neurone.\u00ae Repolarisation \u2014 at a potential difference of around +30 mV the sodium ionchannels close and potassium ion channels open.

The potential difference becomes more negative than the resting potential (i.e. less than -70 mV).^ Resting potential \u2014 the ion channels are reset. The sodium-potassium pump returns the membrane to its resting potential and maintains it until the membrane's excited by another stimulus.After an action potential, the neurone cell membrane can't be excited again straight away. This is because the ion channels are recovering and they can't be made to open \u2014 sodium ion channels are closed during repolarisation and potassium ion channels are closed during hyperpolarisation. This period of recovery is called the refractory period.The Action Potential Moves Along the Neurone as a Wave of Depolarisation1) When an action potential happens, some of the sodium ions that enter the neurone diffuse sideways.2) This causes sodium ion channels in the next region of the neurone to open and sodium ions diffuse into that part.3) This causes a wave of depolarisation to travel along the neurone.4) The wave moves away from the parts of the membrane in the refractory period because these parts can't fire anaction potential.refractory refractoryperiodi It's like a Mexican wave _ = travelling through a - = crowd \u2014 sodium ions _ ' rushing inwards causes __ = a wave of activity alongstimulus -+ + +----------------Nt Nlthe membrane. rwave of depolarisationThe Refractory Period Produces Discrete Impulses1) During the refractory period, ion channels are recovering and can't be opened.2) So the refractory period acts as a time delay between one action potential and the next.This means that:\u2022 action potentials don't overlap, but pass along as discrete (separate) impulses.\u2022 there's a limit to the frequency at which the nerve impulses can be transmitted.\u2022 action potentials are unidirectional (they only travel in one direction).Action Potentials have an AII-or-Nothing Nature1) Once the threshold is reached, an action potentialwill always fire with the same change in voltage, cmaiutimnlnc AAAno matter how big the stimulus is. a2) If the threshold isn't reached, an action potential won't fire.

Sodium ion channels are concentrated at the nodes.5) In a myelinated neurone, depolarisation only happens at the nodes of Ranvier (where sodium ions can get through the membrane).6) The neurone's cytoplasm conducts enough electrical charge to depolarise the next node, so the impulse 'jumps' from node to node. >7) This is called saltatory conduction and it's really fast.8) In a non-myelinated neurone, the impulse travels as a wave along the whole length of the axon membrane (so you get depolarisation along the whole length of the membrane).9) This is slower than saltatory conduction (although it's still pretty quick).Structure of a myelinated motor neurone -cell bodymyelin sheath made up of a Schwann cellnode of Ranvierpk-nodes of RanvierKAAAAJ UUUUUUnerve impulse= Y\u00b0\" need to learn the -r structure of a myelinated 3 z rnotor neurone \"\"\"''\"\"itfininxf\u00a9Axon diameterAction potentials are conducted quicker along axons with bigger diameters because there's less resistance to the flow of ions than in the cytoplasm of a smaller axon.

Take your time and try scribbling it all down a few times till it starts to make some kind of sense. Neurones work because there's an electrical charge across their membrane, which is set up by ion pumps and ion channels. It's a change in this charge that transmits an action potential.Topic 6B \u2014 Nervous Coordination\n","51":"139Synaptic TransmissionWhen an action potential arrives at the end of a neurone, the information has to be passed on to the next cell\u2014 this could be another neurone, a muscle cell or a gland cell.A Synapse is a Junction Between a Neurone and the Next Cell1) A synapse is the junction between a neurone and another neurone, or between a neurone and an effector cell, e.g. a muscle or gland cell.2) The tiny gap between the cells at a synapse is called the synaptic cleft.3) The presynaptic neurone (the one before the synapse) has a swelling called a synaptic knob. This contains synaptic vesicles filled with chemicals called neurotransmitters.4) When an action potential reaches the end of a neurone it causes neurotransmitters to be released into the synaptic cleft.They diffuse across to the postsynaptic membrane (the one after the synapse) and bind to specific receptors.5) When neurotransmitters bind to receptors they might trigger an action potential (in a neurone), cause muscle contraction(in a muscle cell), or cause a hormone to be secreted (from a gland cell).6) Because the receptors are only on the postsynaptic membranes, synapses make sure impulses are unidirectional \u2014 the impulse can only travel in one direction.7) Neurotransmitters are removed from the cleft so the response doesn't keep happening, e.g. they're taken backinto the presynaptic neurone or they're broken down by enzymes (and the products are taken into the neurone).8) There are many different neurotransmitters, e.g. acetylcholine (ACh) and noradrenaline. Synapses that use acetylcholine are called cholinergic synapses. Their structure is exactly the same as in the diagram above.Typical structure of a synapsepostsynaptic presynaptic ,- _ ff membranemembranesynapticknobvesiclefilled with synaptic receptorsneu-otransmitters cleft\nACh Transmits the Nerve Impulse Across a Cholinergic SynapseThis is how a nerve impulse is transmitted across a cholinergic synapse: 1)2)3)An action potential (see pages 136-137) arrives at the synaptic knob of the presynaptic neurone.The action potential stimulates voltage-gated calcium ion channels in the presynaptic neurone to open.Calcium ions diffuse into the synaptic knob.(They're pumped out afterwards by active transport.)vesicle containing AChCa2111 m i ii 11 n i n . m hi 'i\" Voltage-gated ion channels - - open at a certain voltage, r , I I I II 1 I I \\ l l I 1 l1 ' \" 1 \" 1vesicles fuse with the membrane and release ACharrival of action \u2014 potentialCa2AChreceptorsCa diffuses into the synaptic knobThe influx of calcium ions into the synaptic knob causes the synaptic vesicles to move to the presynaptic membrane. They then fuse with the presynaptic membrane.The vesicles release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) into the synaptic cleft\u2014 this is called exocytosis.6) ACh diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to specific cholinergic receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.7) This causes sodium ion channels in the postsynaptic neurone to open.8) The influx of sodium ions into the postsynaptic membrane causes depolarisation. An action potential on the postsynaptic membrane is generated if the threshold is reached.9) ACh is removed from the synaptic cleft so the response doesn't keep happening. It's broken down by an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the products are re-absorbed by the presynaptic neurone and used to make more ACh.ACh diffuses across and:ptors .> *\u20197S, #new action\u2014\u0000 potential) i* ais generatedAChE breaks down ACh and the products are re-absorbedTopic 6B \u2014 Nervous Coordination\n140Synaptic TransmissionNeurotransmitters Can be Excitatory, Inhibitory or Both1) Excitatory neurotransmitters depolarise the postsynaptic membrane, making it fire an action potential if the threshold is reached. E.g. acetylcholine is an excitatory neurotransmitter at cholinergic synapses in the CNS \u2014 it binds to cholinergic receptors to cause an action potential in the postsynaptic membrane \u2014 and at neuromuscular junctions (see below).2) Inhibitory neurotransmitters hyperpolarise the postsynaptic membrane (make the potential difference more negative), preventing it from firing an action potential. E.g. acetylcholine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter at cholinergic synapses in the heart. When it binds to receptors here, it can cause potassium ion channels to open on the postsynaptic membrane, hyperpolarising it.Summation at Synapses Finely Tunes the Nervous ResponseIf a stimulus is weak, only a small amount of neurotransmitter will be released from a neurone into the synaptic cleft. This might not be enough to excite the postsynaptic membrane to the threshold level and stimulate an action potential. Summation is where the effect of neurotransmitter released from many neurones (or one neurone that's stimulated a lot in a short period of time) is added together. There are two types of summation:Spatial summation1)2)3)Temporal summation_ + + + +Temporal summation is where two or more nerve impulses arrive in quick 4succession from the same presynaptic neurone. This makes an action potential u\u0000 r , \u0000 ,.................. r 7 r .

These clefts store the enzyme that breaks down ACh (acetylcholinesterase \u2014 AChE).\u2022 The postsynaptic membrane has more receptors than other synapses. ^imiiiiiiiiiiiiumiiii^. . - You need to be able to ^\u2022 ACh is always excitatory at a neuromuscular junction.

You might have to predict the effects that a drug would have at a synapse in your exam. Here are some examples of how drugs can affect synaptic transmission:\u00a9Some drugs are the same shape as neurotransmitters so they mimic their action at receptors (these drugs are called agonists).This means more receptors are activated.

This results in the muscle being paralysed.ACh \/Ino action potential\u00a9Some drugs inhibit the enzyme that breaks down neurotransmitters (they stop it from working).

When gametes from two parents fuse together, the alleles they contain form the genotype of the offspring produced.

But don't despair \u2014 once you've learnt what the words mean and know how genetic diagrams work it'll ail just fall into place.Topic 7A \u2014 Genetics\n","53":"759Linkage and EpistasisRight, this stuff is fairly hard, so if you don't get it first time don't panic just work through it again until you do...Some Characteristics are Sex-linked1) The genetic information for gender is carried on two sex chromosomes.2) In mammals, females have two X chromosomes (XX) and males have one X and one V chromosome (XY).3) A characteristic is said to be sex-linked when the allele that codes for it is located on a sex chromosome.4) The Y chromosome is smaller than the X chromosome and carries fewer genes.So most genes on the sex chromosomes are only carried on the X chromosome (called X-linked genes).5) As males only have one X chromosome, they often only have one allele for sex-linked genes.So because they only have one copy, they express the characteristic of this allele even if it's recessive.This makes males more likely than females to show recessive phenotypes for genes that are sex-linked.6) Genetic disorders caused by faulty alleles on sex chromosomes include colour blindness and haemophilia.The faulty alleles for both of these disorders are carried on the X chromosome \u2014 they're called X-linked disorders.Example1) Colour blindness is a sex-linked disorder caused by a faulty allele carried on the X chromosome.2) As it's sex-linked both the chromosome and the allele are represented in the genetic diagram, e.g. Xn, where X represents the X chromosome and n the faulty allele for colour vision.3) The Y chromosome doesn't have an allele for colour vision so is just represented by Y.4) Females would need two copies of the recessive allele to be colour blind, while males only need one copy. This means colour blindness is much rarer in women than men.Parents'genotypesGametes'allelesPossible genotypes of offspringCarrier femaleUnaffected maleXN XnXN Y(g)XN XNX\"Y X\"XNXn YUnaffectedUnaffected Carrier Colour-blindfemalemalefemalemaleN \u2014 normal colour vision allele n \u2014 faulty colour vision allele7) In the example above, there's a 3 : 1 ratio of offspring without colour blindness : offspring with colour\u0000blindness. But when a female carrier and a male without colour-blindness have children (as in this example), only their male offspring are at risk of being colour-blind. So you can also say that there's a predicted 2:1:1 ratio \u2014 of female offspring without colour-blindness : male offspring without colour-blindness : male offspring with colour-blindness.8) This ratio will change if a female carrier (XNXn) and a male with colour-blindness (XnY) have children.The predicted ratio will then be 1 : 1 \u2014 of offspring with colour-blindness : offspring without colour-blindness. The ratio will be the same for offspring of each gender. You only end up with this predicted ratio for a monohybrid F, cross with a sex-linked characteristic.Some Autosomal Genes are LinkedD2)Autosome is the fancy name for any chromosome that isn't a sex chromosome.Autosomal genes are the genes located on the autosomes.Genes on the same autosome are said to be linked \u2014 because they're on the same autosome they'll stay together during the independent segregation of chromosomes in meiosis I, and their alleles will be passed on to the offspring together. The only reason this won't happen is if crossing over splits them up first3) The closer together two genes are on the autosome,the more closely they are said to be linked. This is because Genes A, B crossing over is less likely to split them up. T ^4) If two genes are autosomally linked, you won't get the ~ phenotypic ratio you expect in the offspring of a cross.5) For example, in a dihybrid cross between two heterozygous parents you'd expect a 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 ratio in the offspring (see previous page). Instead, the phenotypic ratio is more likely to be that expected for a monohybrid cross between two heterozygous parents (3:1) because the two autosomally-linked alleles are inherited together. This means that a higher proportion of the offspring will have their parents' (heterozygous) genotype and phenotype.6) This allows you to use the predicted phenotypic ratio to identify autosomal linkage.Topic 7A \u2014 Geneticsand C are all linked.Crossing over is when two homologous (paired) chromosomes swap bits'. It happens in meiosis I before independent segregation. You'll have learnt about this in Year 1 of your course.An autosomeGenes A and B are more closely linked than genes A and C.\n760Linkage and EpistasisGenetic Cross Results Can Show Autosomal LinkageIn the exam you might get some genetic cross results that show linkage and have to explain them.ExampleA scientist was investigating linkage between the genes for eye colour and wing length in fruit flies.The gene for normal wings (N) is dominant to the gene for vestigial wings (n) and the gene for red eyes (R) is dominant to the gene for purple eyes (r). The first cross the scientist carried out was between flies homozygous dominant for both normal wings and red eyes (NNRR) and flies homozygous recessive for both vestigial wings and purple eyes (nnrr). The resulting offspring were all heterozygous for normal wings and red eyes (NnRr).The second cross the scientist carried out was between these offspring (NnRr) and the flies homozygous recessive for vestigial wings and purple eyes (nnrr).He expected a 1 : I : 1 :1 ratio as shown below:i n 111 m n 11111 m i m \/\/, _ This is known as a back -Parents'allelesNnRrGametes'Tcross (crossing the offspring - with one of the parents). ~\"'I I 1 I I M M II I I I I I 11 III I I \"NHowever, the results he got forail*les V\/Kjy'C\/Vy \\ \u00a9 \u00a9 \u00ae \u00a9this cross show a 8 : 1 : 1 : 8 ratio as in the table:Number of offspringNnRrNnRrNnRrNnRrNormal wings, red eyes = 4Normal wings, red eyes (NlnRr)1216\u00a9NnrrNnrrNnrrNnrrNormal wings, purple eyes = 4Normal wings, purple eyes (Nnrr)152nnRrnnRrnnRrnnRrVestigial wings, red eyes = 4Vestigial wings, red eyes (nnRr)148\u00a9nnrrnnrrnnrrnnrrVestigial wings, purple eyes = 4Vestigial wings, purple eyes (nnrr)1184Phenotypic ratio = 1 :1 :1 :1Phenotypic rato = 8 : 1 : 1 : 8In order for the NnRr and nnrr genotypes to be so common in the offspring, the NR alleles and the nr alleles in the NnRr parent must have been linked. This means that the NnRr parent produced mostly NR and nr gametes. Some Nr and nR gametes were still made due to crossing over, but there were fewer Nnrr and nnRr offspring overall. As a result, a higher proportion of the offspring have their parents' phenotypes.An Epistatic Gene Masks the Expression of Another Gene1) Many different genes can control the same characteristic \u2014 they interact to form the phenotype.2) This can be because the allele of one gene masks (blocks) the expression of the alleles of other genes\u2014 this is called epistasis.Example 1In humans a widow's peak (see picture) is controlled by one gene and baldness by others. If you have the alleles that code for baldness, it doesn't matter whether you have the allele for a widow's peak or not, as you have no hair. The baldness genes are epistatic to the widow's peak gene, as the baldness genes mask the expression of the widow's peak gene.Example 2Flower pigment in a plant is controlled by two genes. Gene 1 codes for a yellow pigment (Y is the dominant yellow allele) and gene 2 codes for an enzyme that turns the yellow pigment orange (R is the dominant orange allele). If you don't have the Y allele it won't matter if you have the R allele or not as the flower will be colourless. Gene 1 is epistatic to gene 2 as it can mask the expression of gene 2.gene 2 (RR or Rr) \u0000geneColourlessI |YellowOrangemolecule.^pigmentpigment3) Crosses involving epistatic genes don't result in the expected phenotypic ratios given above, e.g. if you cross two heterozygous orange flowered plants (YyRr) from the above example you wouldn't get the expected 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 phenotypic ratio for a normal dihybrid cross.Topic 7A \u2014 Genetics\n767Linkage and EpistasisYou can Predict the Phenotypic Ratios for Some Epistatic GenesJust as you can predict the phenotypic ratios for a normal dihybrid cross (see page 158), you can predict the phenotypic ratios for dihybrid crosses involving some epistatic genes too:A dihybrid cross involving a recessive epistatic allele \u2014 9Having two copies of the recessive epistatic allele masks (blocks) the expression of the other gene. If you cross a homozygous recessive parent with a homozygous dominant parent you will get a 9 : 3 : 4 phenotypic ratio of dominant both : dominant epistatic recessive other: recessive epistatic in the F2 generation.r_______E.g. the flower example from the previous page isF, crossYYRR x yyrr = all YyRrYyRrOrange = YYRR, YYRr,F: crossYyRrYRYr\u00ae \u00a9 \u00ae \u00ae YyRR,YyRr = 9Yellow= Yyrr, YYrr = 3 White = yyRR, yyRr, yyrr = 4 Phenotypic ratio: 9:3:4YYRRYYRrYyRRYyRrYYRrYYr rYyRrYyr rYyRRYyRr yyRR yyRrYyRrYyr ryyR ryyrran example of a recessive epistatic allele. If a plant is homozygous recessive for the epistatic gene (yy) then it will be colourless, masking the expression of the orange gene. So if you cross homozygous parents, you should get a 9 : 3 : 4 ratio of orange : yellow : white in the F2 generation. You can check the phenotypic ratio is right using a genetic diagram:A dihybrid cross involving a dominant epistatic allele \u2014 12:3:1Having at least one copy of the dominant epistatic allele masks (blocks) the expression of the other gene. Crossing a homozygous recessive parent with a homozygous dominant parent will produce a 12 : 3 : 1 phenotypic ratio of dominant epistatic : recessive epistatic dominant other: recessive both in the F3 generation.E.g. squash colour is controlled by two genes \u2014 the colour \u00a3 crossepistatic gene (W\/w) and the yellow gene (Y\/y). The no-colour, white allele (W) is dominant over the coloured allele (w), so WW or Ww will be white and ww will be coloured. The yellow gene has the dominant yellow allele (Y) and the recessive green allele (y). So if the plant has at least one W, then the squash will be white, masking the expression of the yellow gene. So if you cross wwyy with WWYY, you'll get a 12 : 3 : 1 ratio of white : yellow : green in the F2 generation. Here's a genetic diagram to prove it:WWYY x wwyy = all WwYywwYy\u00a9 @> @) @Ww Y y\u00a9WWY Y WWY yWw Y YWw Y y(w y)WWY y WWy y Ww Y y Ww y yU (wy)Ww Y Y Ww Y ywwYY wwYy<SS)Ww Y y Ww y y w w Y ywwy yWhite = WWYY, WWYy, WWyy, WwYY, WwYy, Wwyy = 12 Yellow = wwYY, wwYy \u00bb 3 Green = wwyy = 1 Phenotypic ratio: 12:3:1Practice QuestionsQ1 What is a sex-linked characteristic?Q2 Two genes are autosomally-linked.

And here's why...Totipotent Stem Cells are Able to Mature into Any Type of Body Cell1) Multicellular organisms are made up from many different cell types that are specialised for their function, e.g. liver cells, muscle cells, white blood cells.2) All these specialised cell types originally came from stem cells.3) Stem cells are unspecialised cells that can develop into other types of cell.4) Stem cells divide to become new cells, which then become specialised.5) All multicellular organisms have some form of stem cell.6) Stem cells are found in the embryo (where they become all the specialised cells needed to form a fetus) and in some adult tissues (where they become specialised cells that need to be replaced, e.g. stem cells in the intestines constantly replace intestinal epithelial cells).7) Stem cells that can mature (develop) into any type of body cell in an organism,(including the cells that make up the placenta in mammals) are called totipotent cells.8) Totipotent stem cells are only present in mammals in the first few cell divisions of an embryo.9) After this point the embryonic stem cells become pluripotent. They can still specialise into any cell in the body, but lose the ability to become the cells that make up the placenta.10) The stem cells present in adult mammals are either:\u2022 Multipotent stem cells \u2014 These are able to differentiate into a few different types of cell. For example, both red and white blood cells can be formed from multipotent stem cells found in bone marrow.\u2022 Unipotent stem cells \u2014 These can only differentiate into one type of cell.For example, there's a type of unipotent stem cell that can only divide to produce epidermal skin cells, which make up the outer layer of your skin.Stem Cells Become Specialised Because Different Genes are ExpressedStem cells become specialised because during their development, they only transcribe and translate part of their DNA:1)2)3)4)5)6)Stem cells all contain the same genes \u2014 but during development, not all of them are transcribed and translated (expressed).\"Mill III,, ,, m\u201e(\/- Remember: transcription is 3 Z when DNA is copied into ^- mRNA. Translation is when r- proteins are produced using - Z the code in mRNA. ~Under the right conditions, some genes are expressed and others are switched off. n 111'111111'111 m i i i n\\cmRNA is only transcribed from specific genes.The mRNA from these genes is then translated into proteins.These proteins modify the cell \u2014 they determine the cell structure and control cell processes (including the expression of more genes, which produces more proteins).Changes to the cell produced by these proteins cause the cell to become specialised. These changes are difficult to reverse, so once a cell has specialised it stays specialised. oft^e 9irls expresseddifferent jeans.[Example: Red Blood Cells')1) Red blood cells are produced from a type of stem cell in the bone marrow. They contain lots of haemoglobin and have no nucleus (to make room for more haemoglobin).2) The stem cell produces a new cell in which the genes for haemoglobin production are expressed. Other genes, such as those involved in removing the nucleus, are expressed too. Many other genes are not expressed (switched off), resulting in a specialised red blood cell.Topic 8A \u2014 Mutations and Gene Expression\n187Stem CellsCardiomyocytes Can be Made from Unipotent Stem Cells1) Cardiomyocytes are heart muscle cells that make up a lot of the tissue in our hearts.In mature mammals, it's thought that they can't divide to replicate themselves.2) This meant that for ages, everyone thought that we weren't able to regenerate our own heart cells at all. This is a major problem if the heart becomes damaged, e.g. by a heart attack, or the cells became worn out through age. Recent research however, has suggested that our hearts dohave some regenerative capability.3) Some scientists now think that old or damaged cardiomyocytes can be replaced by new cardiomyocytes derived from a small supply of unipotent stem cells in the heart.4) Some researchers think that this process could be constantly occurring,but haven't yet agreed on how quickly it happens.\u2022 Some believe that it's a really slow process and that it's possible that somecardiomyocytes are never replaced throughout a person's entire lifetime.\u2022 Others think that it's occurring more quickly, so that everycardiomyocyte in the heart is replaced several times in a lifetime.Stem Cells Can be Used to Treat Human DisordersSince stem cells can divide into a range of specialised cell types, doctors and scientists think they could be used to replace cells damaged by illness or injury.Some Stem Cell Therapies Already Exist1) Some stem cell therapies already exist for some diseases affecting the blood and immune system.2) Bone marrow contains stem cells that can bccomc specialised to form any type of blood cell. Bone marrow transplants can be used to rcplace the faulty bone marrow in patients that produce abnormal blood cells. The stem cells in the transplanted bone marrow divide and specialise to produce healthy blood cells.3) This technique has been used successfully to treat leukaemia (a cancer of the blood or bone marrow) and lymphoma (a cancer of the lymphatic system).4) It has also been used to treat some genetic disorders, such as sickle-cell anaemia and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID):Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a genetic disorder that affects the immune system. People with SCID have a poorly functioning immune system as their white blood cells (made in the bone marrow from stem cells) are defective. This means they can't defend the body against infections by identifying and destroying microorganisms. So SCID sufferers are extremely susceptible to infections. Treatment with a bone marrow transplant replaces the faulty bone marrow with donor bone marrow that contains stem cells without the faulty genes that cause SCID. These then differentiate to produce functional white blood cells. These cells can identify and destroy invading pathogens, so the immune system functions properly.Stem Cells Could be Used to Treat Other DiseasesScientists are researching the use of stem cells as treatment for lots of conditions, including:\u2022 Spinal cord injuries \u2014 stem cells could be used to replace damaged nerve tissue. n n t,,,, f n \\\\i1'\u2022 Heart disease and damage caused by heart attacks \u2014 ~ These tr\u20acatmentsbwt -stem cells could be used to replace damaged heart tissue. \u201c aren't z\u2022 Bladder conditions \u2014 stem cells could be used to grow whole bladders, ^ ^^dimcal trials.

Stem cells could be used to grow organs for those people awaiting transplants.\u2022 They could improve the quality of life for many people \u2014 e.g. stem cells could be used to replace damaged cells in the eyes of people who are blind.Human Stem Cells Can Come from Adult Tissue or EmbryosTo use stem cells scientists have to get them from somewhere. There are three main potential sources of human stem cells:(5Adult Stem Cells1) These are obtained from the body tissues of an adult.For example, adult stem cells are found in bone marrow.2) They can be obtained in a relatively simple operation \u2014 with very little risk involved, but quite a lot of discomfort.3) Adult stem cells aren't as flexible as embryonic stem cells \u2014 they can only specialise into a limited range of cells, not all body cell types (they're multipotent).<\u00a3Embryonic Stem Cells1) These are obtained from embryos at an early stage of development.2) Embryos are created in a laboratory using in vitro fertilisation (IVF) \u2014 egg cells are fertilised by sperm outside the womb.3) Once the embryos are approximately 4 to 5 days old, stem cells are removed from them and the rest of the embryo is destroyed.4) Embryonic stem cells can divide an unlimited number of times and develop into all types of body cells (they're pluripotent).(2Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPS Cells)x\\l1 l M ' M I) | \/ | , | | |l, , , , (|- Inscription factors are - r proteins that control whether =- \u00b0r not genes are transcribed ~'\/a see Pa9e 190 for more Z \/n f'11 ii 11 \/ , \/111 M , M)Xs\"1) iPS cells are created by scientists in the lab. The process involves 'reprogramming' specialised adult body cells so that they become pluripotent.2) The adult cells are made to express a series of transcription factors that are normally associated with pluripotent stem cells. The transcription factors cause the adult body cells to express genes that are associated with pluripotency.3) One of the ways that these transcription factors can be introduced to the adult cells is by infecting them with a specially-modified virus. The virus has the genes coding for the transcription factors within its DNA. When the virus infects the adult cell, these genes are passed into the adult cell's DNA, meaning that the cell is able to produce the transcription factors.4) Induced pluripotent stem cells could become really useful in research and medicine in the future\u2014 see next page. At the moment though, more research into how similar they actually are to true pluripotent embryonic stem cells is needed before they can be properly utilised.Topic 8A \u2014 Mutations and Gene Expression\n7 89Stem CellsThere are Ethical Issues Surrounding Embryonic Stem Cell Use1) Obtaining stem cells from embryos created by IVF raises ethical issues because the procedure results in the destruction of an embryo that could become a fetus if placed in a womb.2) Some people believe that at the moment of fertilisation an individual is formed that has the right to life \u2014 so they believe that it's wrong to destroy embryos.3) Some people have fewer objections to stem cells being obtained from egg cells that haven't been fertilised by sperm, but have been artificially activated to start dividing. This is because the cells couldn't survive past a few days and wouldn't produce a fetus if placed in a womb.4) Some people think that scientists should only use adult stem cells because their production doesn't destroy an embryo. But adult stem cells can't develop into all the specialised cell types that embryonic stem cells can.5) This is where induced pluripotent stem cells could prove really useful. They have the potential to be as flexible as embryonic stem cells, but, as they're obtained from adult tissue, there aren't the same ethical issues surrounding their use. Good news all round.6) It's also possible that iPS cells could be made from a patient's own cells. These iPS cells, which would be genetically identical to the patient's cells, could then be used to grow some new tissue or an organ that the patient's body wouldn't reject (rejection of transplants occurs quite often and is caused by the patient's immune system recognising the tissue as foreign and attacking it).7) The decision makers in society have to take into account everyone's views when making decisions about important scientific work like stem cell research and its use to treat human disorders.m i n i n 111111 m i u w \/11111111111 n n n 111 n 1111111 n 111111111 \/111 n 111\/.- You might be asked to evaluate the use of stem cells in treating human disorders in r r the exams \u2014 so make sure you know all the pros and cons on pages 187 to 189. -\"n I I I i n I I I I I I I I 11 11 I I II i \/ \/ u l M I II II I I I II I I I I I M I I I I I I I I I I II I II I 11 \/ M I IIsPractice QuestionsQ1 At what stage of development can totipotent stem cells be found in mammals?Q2 Describe the difference between pluripotent and multipotent stem cells.Q3 How do stem cells become specialised?Q4 Name two conditions that stem cells could potentially be used to treat.Q5 Describe one difference between embryonic and adult stem cells.Exam QuestionQ1 Scientists are currently exploring the potential for the use of stem cells in medicine.a) Explain one way in which stem cell therapy is currently being used.

For example, foreign DNA can be inserted into microorganisms to produce lots of useful protein, e.g. insulin:jvM \/1 \" 1 I I \" , , , , , , , , I , 1 , # ( !

( I\\\n3)4)5)Transformed plants can also be produced. A gene that codes for a desirable protein is inserted into a plasmid. The plasmid is added to a bacterium and the bacterium is used as a vector to get the gene into the plant cells.If the right promoter region has been added along with the gene (see p. 199), the transformed cells will be able to produce the desired protein.Transformed animals can be produced too \u2014 a gene that codes for a desirable protein can be inserted into an early animal embryo or into the egg cells of a female. If the gene is inserted into a very early embryo, all the body cells of the resulting transformed animal will end up containing the gene. Inserting it into the egg cells means that when the female reproduces, all the cells of her offspring will contain the gene.Promoter regions that are only activated in specific cell types can be used to control exactly which of an animal's body cells the protein is produced in. If the protein is only produced in certain cells, it can be harvested more easily. Producing the protein in the wrong cells could also damage the organism.Recombinant DNA Technology Can be Used to Benefit HumansTransformed organisms (microorganisms, plants and animals) can be used in a variety of ways. You need to be able to interpret information about how they are used. Here are some examples:AgricultureAgricultural crops can be transformed so that they give higher yields or are more nutritious. This means these plants can be used to reduce the risk of famine and malnutrition. Crops can also be transformed to have pest resistance, so that fewer pesticides are needed. This reduces costs and reduces any environmental problems associated with using pesticides.For example, Golden Rice is a variety of transformed rice. It contains one gene from a maize plant and one gene from a soil bacterium, which together enable the rice to produce beta-carotene. The beta-carotene is used by our bodies to produce vitamin A. Golden Rice is being developed to reduce vitamin A deficiency in areas where there's a shortage of dietary vitamin A, e.g. south Asia, Africa. Vitamin A deficiency is a big problem in these areas, e.g. up to 500 000 children per year worldwide go blind due to vitamin A deficiency.IndustryIndustrial processes often use biological catalysts (enzymes). These enzymes can be produced from transformed organisms, so they can be produced in large quantities for less money, reducing costs.For example, chymosin (or rennin) is an enzyme used in cheese-making. It used to be made from rennet (a substance produced in the stomach of cows), but it can now be produced by transformed organisms. This means it can be made in large quantities, relatively cheaply and without killing any cows, making some cheese suitable for vegetarians.MedicineMany drugs and vaccines are produced by transformed organisms, using recombinant DNA technology. They can be made quickly, cheaply and in large quantities using this method.For example, insulin is used to treat Type 1 diabetes and used to come from animals (cow, horse or pig pancreases). This insulin wasn't human insulin though, so it didn't work quite as well. Human insulin is now made from transformed microorganisms, using a cloned human insulin gene (see above).Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n202Using Recombinant DNA TechnologyThere are Concerns About the Use of Recombinant DNA Technology...There are ethical, financial and social issues associated with the use of recombinant DNA technology:AgricultureFarmers might plant only one type of transformed crop (this is called monoculture). This could make the whole crop vulnerable to the same disease because the plants are genetically identical. Environmentalists are also concerned about monocultures reducing biodiversity, as this could damage the environment.Some people are concerned about the possibility of 'superweeds' \u2014 weeds that are resistant to herbicides. These could occur if transformed crops interbreed with wild plants. There could then be an uncontrolled spread of recombinant DNA, with unknown consequences.Organic farmers can have their crops contaminated by wind-blown seeds from nearby genetically modified crops. This means they can't sell their crop as organic and may lose their income.IndustryAnti-globalisation activists oppose globalisation (e.g. the growth of large multinational companies at the expense of smaller ones). A few, large biotechnology companies control some forms of genetic engineering. As the use of this technology increases, these companies get bigger and more powerful. This may force smaller companies out of business, e.g. by making it harder for them to compete. Without proper labelling, some people think they won't have a choice about whether to consume food made using genetically engineered organisms.Some consumer markets, such as the EU, won't import GM foods and products. This can cause an economic loss to producers who have traditionally sold to those markets.MedicineCompanies who own genetic engineering technologies may limit the use of technologies that could be saving lives.Some people worry this technology could be used unethically, e.g. to make designer babies (babies that have characteristics chosen by their parents). This is currently illegal though.Recombinant DNA technology also creates ownership issues. Here are some examples:\u2022 There is some debate about who owns genetic material from humans once it has been removed from the body \u2014 the donor or the researcher. Some people argue that the individual holds the right to their own genetic information, however others argue that value is created by the researcher who uses it to develop a medicine or in diagnosis.\u2022 A small number of large corporations own patents to particular seeds. They can charge high prices, sometimes including a 'technology fee', and can require farmers to repurchase seeds each year.If non-GM crops are contaminated by GM crops, farmers can be sued for breaching the patent law....But Humanitarians Think it will Benefit PeopleRecombinant DNA technology has many potential humanitarian benefits:1) Agricultural crops could be produced that help reduce the risk of famine and malnutrition, e.g. drought-resistant crops for drought-prone areas.2) Transformed crops could be used to produce useful pharmaceutical products (e.g. vaccines) which could make drugs available to more people, e.g. in areas where refrigeration (usually needed for storing vaccines) isn't available.3) Mcdicines could be produced more chcaply, so more people can afford them.4) Recombinant DNA technology has the potential to be used in gene therapy to treat human diseases (see next page).>0U need to be able z- to balance the humanitarian : r h\/neflts opposing views =- from environmentalists and ~ S ant|-9|obalisat,on activists r(see above) -Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n203Using Recombinant DNA TechnologyGene Therapy Could be Used to Treat or Cure Genetic Disorders and CancerRecombinant DNA technology could also be used to treat human diseases. This is known as gene therapy.Z ^ therapy isn't being \"'z1) Gene therapy involves altering the defective genes (mutated alleles) r used widely yet but there is a =inside cells to treat genetic disorders and cancer. r somatlc gene therapy r2) How you do this depends on whether the disorder is caused by a z are un^Jn otl'ler treatments zmutated dominant allele or two mutated recessive alleles (see page 156): \u2018 111 \/11 n\u00b0i u wT m nf?',\u2022 If it's caused by two mutated recessive alleles you can add a working dominant allele to make up for them (you 'supplement' the faulty ones).\u2022 If it's caused by a mutated dominant allele you can 'silence' the dominant allele (e.g. by sticking a bit of DNA in the middle of the allele so it doesn't work any more).Both of these processes involve inserting a DNA fragment into the person's original DNA.How you get the 'new' allele (DNA) inside the cell:1) The allele is inserted into cells using vectors (see page 199) just like in recombinant DNA technology.2) Different vectors can be used, e.g. altered viruses, plasmids or liposomes (spheres made of lipid).There are two types of gene therapy:1) Somatic therapy \u2014 this involves altering the alleles in body cells, particularly the cells that aremost affected by the disorder. For example, cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that's very damaging to the respiratory system, so somatic therapy for CF targets the epithelial cells lining the lungs. Somatic therapy doesn't affect the individual's sex cells (sperm or eggs) though, so any offspring could still inherit the disease.2) Germ line therapy \u2014 this involves altering the alleles in the sex cells. This means that every cell of any offspring produced from these cells will be affected by the gene therapy and they won't suffer from the disease. Germ line therapy in humans is currently illegal though.There are also many ethical issues associated with gene therapy. For example, some people are worried that the technology could be used in ways other than for medical treatment, such as for treating the cosmetic effects of aging. Other people worry that there's the potential to do more harm than good by using the technology (e.g. risk of overexpression of genes \u2014 gene produces too much of the missing protein).Practice QuestionsQ1 What are transformed organisms?Q2 Give one financial issue associated with the use of recombinant DNA technology in industry.Q3 What is gene therapy?Exam Questionof wheat plants.

That's where you'll be in a few months' time.After revising all this stuff that is. As recombinant DNA technology advances, more questions will pop up about its implications.

To calculate it you use this equation:A positive value shows an increase and a negative value shows a decrease.final value - original value 1 nn Percentage change = . . . , x 100\u00b0 b original valueE.g. a person's blood glucose concentration before a meal was 4.2 mmol dm 3.Two hours after a meal it was 6.5 mmol dm-3.

E.g. an organism with a surface area to volume ratio of 2 : 1 would theoretically have a surface area twice as large as its volume.3) Ratios are usually most useful in their simplest (smallest) form. To simplify a ratio, divide each side by the same number. It's in its simplest form when there's nothing left you can divide by. To get a ratio of X : Y in the formX : 1, divide both sides by Y. E.g. to get 28 : 34 into the ratio of X : 1, divide both sides by 34. You get 0.82 : 1.You Need to be Able to Use Logarithms1) It's tricky to plot graphs with very small and very large numbers (e.g. both 0.1 and 1000) on the same axis.2) We can make it easier by converting values to their logarithms and plotting them on a logarithmic scale (e.g. a logl0 scale).3) On a log1() scale, each value is ten times larger than the value before. This means the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 on a log10 scale represent 10, 100, 1000 and 10 000 on a linear (normal) scale.-'y'\"\"\u2019,\"'.\"\" i\" \"mi in, it- i need to be able to read off a : ~ logarithmic scale on a q 71 M , M II II II I I I I H M , Ion a graph. - 11111 I if1log10 scale l linear scale r4) To calculate logarithms, you need to use the log button on your calculator.

To do this add together all the data values and divide by the total number of values in the sample.TesttubeMass (g)Mean (g) ^Range (g)Repeat 1Repeat 2Repeat 3A283732(28 + 37 + 32) -r 3 = 32.337-28 = 9B475160(47 + 51 + 60) -+ 3 = 52.760-47 = 13--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2) You might also need to calculate the range (how spread out the data is).^To do this find the largest data value and subtract the smallest data value from it.3) Standard deviation can be more useful than the range because it tells you how values are spread about the mean rather than just the total spread of data. A small standard deviation means the repeated results are all similar and close to the mean, i.e. they are precise.Like the mean, the median and mode are both types of average.\u2022 To calculate the median, put all your data in numerical order. The median is the middle value in this list.If you have an even number of values, the median is halfway between the middle two values.\u2022 To calculate the mode, count how many times each value comes up. The mode is the number thatappears most often. A set of data might not have a mode \u2014 or it might have more than one.Practical Skills\n277Processing and Presenting DataWatch Out For Significant Figures...D2)3)The first significant figure of a number is the first digit that isn't a zero. The second, third and fourthsignificant figures follow on immediately after the first (even if they're zeros).When you're processing your data you may well want to round any really long numbers to a certainnumber of significant figures. E.g. 0.6878976 rounds to 0.69 to 2 s.f..When you're doing calculations using measurements given to a certain number of significant figures, you should give your answer to the lowest number of significant figures that was used in the calculation.For example: ^Miiiiifniiiiiiiiiiinuuiii\/\/r When rounding a number, if the r 1.2 -r 1 .85 = 0.648648648... =0.65 E next digit after the last significant Z^ Round the last - figure you're using is less than five, - 2 s.f.-^3 s.f.

COn i j n ii n ii m i n ii 11111 m 11 This is because the fewer digits a measurement has, the less accurate it is.Your answer can only be as accurate as the least accurate measurement in the calculation...and Standard Form1) When you're processing data you might also want to change very big or very small numbers that have lots of zeros into something more manageable \u2014 this is called standard form.E.g. 1 000 000 can be written 1 x 10\u00b0 and 0.01 7 can be written 1.7x1 O'2.2) To do this you just need to move the decimal point left or right. The number of places the decimal point moves is then represented by a power of 10 \u2014 this is positive for big numbers, and negative for numbers smaller than one. For example:fVW\\A rabbit playing the piano. Definitely not standard form.16 5 00 = 1.65 x 104 The decimal point has moved four places to the left, so the power of 10 is +4. \/YYY^0.000362 = 3.62 x 10~4 The decimal point has moved four places to the right, so the power of 10 is -4.You Need to Understand How and When Statistical Tests are Used to Analyse Data1) The Student's t-test. You can use the Student's t-test when you have two sets of data that you want to compare. It tests whether there is a significant difference in the means of the two data sets. The value obtained is compared to a critical value, which helps you decide how likely it is that the results or 'differences in the means' were due to chance. If the value obtained from the t-test is greater than the critical value at a probability (P value) of 5% or less (< 0.05), then you can be 95% confident that the difference is significant and not due to chance. This is called a 95% confidence limit \u2014 which is good enough for most biologists to reject the null hypothesis. A null hypothesis is a special type of hypothesis used with statistical tests. It states that there's no significant difference between the things you're measuring.2) The Chi-squared test (see pages 162-163). You can use the Chi-squared test when you have categorical (grouped) data and you want to compare whether your observed results are statistically different from your expected results. You compare your result to a critical value \u2014 if it's larger than the critical value at P = 0.05, you can be 95% certain the difference is significant.3) A correlation coefficient, e.g. the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. This test allows you to work out the degree to which two sets of data are correlated (see page 213 for more on correlation).It is given as a value between 1 and -1. A value of 1 indicates a strong positive correlation, 0 means there is no correlation and -1 is a strong negative correlation. You can then compare your result toa critical value to find out whether or not the correlation is significant. \u0000. m u i u u n n i\/w u n i m 11 n i' i u i ^ (___________You can be more confident in your conclusions (see page 213), if they're based on results that have been analysed using a statistical test.; You need to be familiar with the symbols ,: < (less than), > (more than), \u00ab (much= less than) and \u00bb (much greater than . -^M|1|IMM>MIMIlUUlMlininMPractical Skills\n272Processing and Presenting DataUse a Suitable Graph or Chart to Present Your DataScatter graph:Graphs and charts are a great way of presenting data \u2014 they can make results much easier to interpret.1) When you have qualitative data (non-numerical data, e.g. blood group) or discrete data (numericaldata that can only take certain values in a range, e.g. shoe size) you can use bar charts or pie charts.2) When you have continuous data (data that can take any value in arange, e.g. height or weight) you can use histograms or line graphs.3) When you want to show how two variables are related(or correlated, see next page) you can use a scatter graph.Whatever type of graph you use, you should make sure that:\u2022 The dependent variable goes on the y-axis (the vertical axis) and the independent on the x-axis (the horizontal axis).\u2022 You always label the axes, include the quantity and units, and choose a sensible scale.\u2022 The graph covers at least half of the graph paper.If you need to draw a line (or curve) of best fit on a scatter graph,draw the line through or as near to as many points as possible,ignoring any anomalous results.line of fopstfit;<X'XalomaloiISresult\\-N<X-*\u2014i\u2014Average temperature (\u00b0C)Find the Rate By Finding the GradientRate is a measure of how much something is changing over time. Calculating a rate can be useful when analysing your data, e.g. you might want to the find the rate of a reaction. Rates are easy to work out from a graph:For a linear graph you can calculate the Change in Yrate by finding the gradient of the line: Gradient = (^|iange jn ^c -I r . *u- i 24 mmol dm-3 ^ ^ . .-5 So in this example: rate =----------------- = 2.4 mmol dm 3 min1e 10 minutesEThe equation of a straight line can always be written in the form y = mx + c, where m is the gradient and c is the y-intercept (this is the value of y when the line crosses the y-axis). In this example, the equation of the line is y = 2.4x + 0 (or just y = 2.4x). Knowing the equation of the line allows you to estimate results not plotted on the graph. E.g. in this case, when x (the time) is 20 min, y (the sodium ion concentration) will be 2.4x = 2.4 x 20 =5 10Time \/ minThe change in x is 10 min.For a curved (non-linear) graph you can find the rate by drawing a1) Position a ruler on the graph at the point where you want to know the rate.2) Angle the ruler so there is equal space between the ruler and the curve on either side of the point.3) Draw a line along the ruler to make the tangent.Extend the line right across the graph \u2014 it'll help to make your gradient calculation easier as you'll have more points to choose from.4) Calculate the gradient of the tangent to find the rate.Gradient = 55 m2 -f 4.4 years = 12.5 m2 year1When calculating a rate (or anything else for that matter) you might have to convert between units, e.g. seconds and minutes.
