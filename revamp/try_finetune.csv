Even though there is, and has been, a huge variety of different organisms on Earth, they all share some biochemistry— for example, they all contain a few carbon-based compounds that interact in similar ways.

@@@Carbohydrate Structure and Monomer Definition
Most carbohydrates (as well as proteins and nucleic acids) are polymers. Polymers are large, complex molecules composed of long chains of monomers joined together. Monomers are small, basic molecular units. Examples of monomers include monosaccharides, amino acids, and nucleotides. Carbohydrates are made from monosaccharides, which contain the elements C, H, and O. The monomers that carbohydrates are made from are monosaccharides, for example, glucose, fructose, and galactose. Glucose is a hexose sugar — a monosaccharide with six carbon atoms in each molecule. There are two types of glucose, alpha (α) and beta (β) — they're isomers, molecules with the same molecular formula as each other but with the atoms connected in a different way. You need to know the structures of both types of glucose for your exam— it's pretty easy because there's only one difference between the two: α-glucose and β-glucose have the atom groups at the position of carbon number one reversed.

@@@The Formation of Disaccharides Through Condensation Reactions
A condensation reaction is when two molecules join together with the formation of a new chemical bond, and a water molecule is released when the bond is formed. Monosaccharides are joined together by condensation reactions. A glycosidic bond forms between the two monosaccharides as a molecule of water is released. A disaccharide is formed when two monosaccharides join together. For example, two α-glucose molecules are joined together by a glycosidic bond to form maltose. Sucrose is a disaccharide formed from a condensation reaction between a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule. Lactose is another disaccharide formed from a glucose molecule and a galactose molecule. If you're asked to show a condensation reaction, don't forget to include the water molecule as a product.

@@@Hydrolysis Reactions and the Breakdown of Polymers
Polymers can be broken down into monomers by hydrolysis reactions. A hydrolysis reaction breaks the chemical bond between monomers using a water molecule. It's the opposite of a condensation reaction. For example, carbohydrates can be broken down into their constituent monosaccharides by hydrolysis reactions. 

@@@Testing for Sugars Using the Benedict’s Test
Sugar is a general term for monosaccharides and disaccharides. All sugars can be classified as reducing or non-reducing. The Benedict's test is used for detecting the presence of sugars and differs depending on the type of sugar you are testing for. Reducing sugars include all monosaccharides (e.g., glucose) and some disaccharides (e.g., maltose and lactose). To perform the test, you add Benedict's reagent, which is blue, to a sample and heat it in a water bath that's been brought to the boil. If the test is positive, it will form a coloured precipitate. The colour of the precipitate changes from blue to green, to yellow, to orange, and then brick red. The higher the concentration of reducing sugar, the further the colour change goes; this allows you to compare the amount of reducing sugar in different solutions. A more accurate way of doing this is to filter the solution and weigh the precipitate. Always use an excess of Benedict's solution to ensure all the sugar reacts. If the result of the reducing sugars test is negative, there could still be a non-reducing sugar present. To test for non-reducing sugars, like sucrose, you have to break them down into monosaccharides by treating a new sample with dilute hydrochloric acid and carefully heating it in a water bath to the boil. Then you neutralize it with sodium hydrogencarbonate and perform the Benedict's test as you would for a reducing sugar. If the test is positive, a coloured precipitate will form. If the test is negative, the solution remains blue, indicating it does not contain any sugar (either reducing or non-reducing)."

","@@@Overview of Eukaryotic Cells and Organelles

Eukaryotic cells contain a variety of organelles, each with specific functions crucial to the life of the cell. The majority of these organelles are membrane-bound, which is a source of common confusion. It's essential to remember that these organelles are not independent cells but parts of a larger cell. This segment emphasizes the need to understand both the structure and function of these organelles.

@@@Cell-surface (Plasma) Membrane

The cell-surface membrane plays a pivotal role in regulating the passage of substances in and out of the cell. It acts as a selective barrier for animal cells and is found just inside the cell wall of other cells. Made predominantly from lipids and proteins, this structure is equipped with receptor molecules, making it responsive to chemicals such as hormones.

@@@Nucleus

The nucleus, surrounded by a double membrane known as the nuclear envelope, administers the cell's activities by controlling DNA transcription. The nuclear envelope is perforated with pores that allow substances like RNA to move between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Inside the nucleus are chromosomes consisting of protein-bound linear DNA, along with one or more nucleoli, which are responsible for making ribosomes.

@@@Mitochondrion

Mitochondria are often oval-shaped organelles with a double membrane, where the inner membrane forms cristae. Within the internal matrix, enzymes involved in respiration are located. Mitochondria are the sites of aerobic respiration and ATP production, which is particularly important in cells that demand a high amount of energy.

@@@Chloroplast

In plant and algal cells, the chloroplast is a small, flattened structure enclosed by a double membrane. Inside are thylakoid membranes, which in parts form structures called grana—these grana are interlinked by lamellae. Chloroplasts are the location for photosynthesis, with the processes occurring in both the grana and the stroma, a dense fluid within the chloroplast.

@@@Golgi Apparatus and Related Structures

The Golgi apparatus consists of a group of fluid-filled, membrane-bound sacs, also known as cisternae, with vesicles frequently seen at their edges. This organelle processes and packages new lipids and proteins and produces lysosomes. Golgi vesicles are small sacs used to store and transport lipids and proteins out of the cell. Lysosomes, which are a form of Golgi vesicle, contain lysozymes that digest invading cells or worn-out cell components.

@@@Ribosomes and Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)

Ribosomes, which may be free-floating in the cytoplasm or attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), are the sites of protein synthesis. They are composed of RNA and proteins but do not have a membrane. The RER is covered with ribosomes and specializes in folding and processing proteins. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), on the other hand, lacks ribosomes and is involved in the synthesis and processing of lipids.

@@@Cell Wall and Cell Vacuole

Surrounding plant cells, algae, and fungal cells is the cell wall—a rigid structure that provides support and maintains the shape of the cell. The plant and algal cell wall is primarily composed of cellulose, while the fungal cell wall is made of chitin. Plant cells also contain a cell vacuole, a large organelle responsible for maintaining cell pressure, which helps prevent wilting and is also involved in isolating unwanted chemicals within the cell. The vacuole's membrane is known as the tonoplast."

HEALTH AND BEAUTY FOR YOU
June Wong was rather pleased with herself. Since 
setting up the business called Health and Beauty for You 
with her brother, Will, they had managed to keep the 
business going through three very di ff icult years. When 
they set the business up, they agreed that their first 
objective was survival at all costs. Despite the country’s 
economic di ff iculties and some fierce competition, the 
business had built up a good customer base and had 
covered all of its costs for the first three years. Now the 
pair had decided to plan for the next three years and 
the first stage of this was to agree on new objectives for 
the business. June wanted the business to grow and 
she thought the best way to do this was to buy another 
beauty salon in another area of the city. ‘This will get 
the business name really well-known and will give us 
the basis for further sales growth of at least 20% a year,’ 
she told Will. He was not so sure he wanted the sta ff i n g 
and marketing problems associated with another salon. 
‘I think we should aim to make as much profit as we can from the existing salon. I think we could aim for a profit of 
$40,000 per year. We could o ff er a wider range of services 
and increase our prices. A ft er  a l l,  w e  w en t  i n t o  b u s i n ess 
with the intention of becoming rich!’ he reminded June.
Aft er much argument, the pair agreed that the 
new business objective should be, in the short term, 
to open a new salon and to double sales within three 
years. A ft er this had been achieved, the aim should be 
to maximise long-term profits from the two locations 
by improving image and raising prices  – Will thought a 
five-year target of $90,000 per year was realistic.

Introduction
Businesses of any size can bene fi t from having clear 
objectives or targets to work towards. In small sole-
trader businesses, these objectives are o ft en not written 
down or formalised in any way, but the owners will o ft en 
have a clear idea of what they are trying to achieve. In 
partnership organisations, it is important for partners 
to agree on the direction their business should take or 
future disagreements can cause much time to be wasted 
that would be better spent on running the business 
eff ectively. Limited companies must state the overall 38review the success of business activity. In addition, 
for any aim to be successfully achieved, there has 
to be an appropriate strategy  – or detailed plan of 
action  – in place to ensure that resources are correctly 
directed towards the fi nal goal. Th i s  s t r a t e g y  s h o u l d  
be constantly  reviewed to check whether the business 
is on target to achieve its objectives. Both the aims of 
an organisation and the strategies it adopts will o ft en 
change over time. Indeed, a change of objective will 
almost certainly require a change of plan too. A poor 
plan or strategy will lead to failure to reach the target 
(Unit 6  focuses on how businesses develop strategies to 
meet their objectives).
Th e most e ff ective business objectives usually meet the 
following ‘SMART’ criteria:
S – Specific:  Objectives should focus on what the business 
does and should apply directly to that business. A hotel may set 
an objective of 75% bed occupancy over the winter period. This 
objective is specific to this business.
M – Measurable:  O b j e c t i v e s  t h a t  h a v e  a  q u a n t i t a t i v e  v a l u e  a r e  
likely to prove to be more e ff ective targets for directors and 
staff  to work towards. For instance, to increase sales in the 
south-east region by 15% this year.
A – Achievable:  Setting objectives that are almost impossible 
in the time frame given will be pointless. They will demotivate 
staff  who have the task of trying to reach these targets. So 
objectives should be achievable.
R – Realistic and relevant:  O b j e c t i v e s  s h o u l d  b e  r e a l i s t i c  w h e n  
compared with the resources of the company and should be 
expressed in terms relevant to the people who have to carry 
them out. So informing a factory cleaner about ‘increasing 
market share’ is less relevant than a target of reducing usage of 
cleaning materials by 20%.
T – Time-specific:  A time limit should be set when an objective 
is established  – by when does the business expect to increase 
profits by 5%? Without a time limit, it will be impossible to 
assess whether the objective has actually been met.
TOP TIP
Remember the slogan: SMART.
Aims, mission statements, objectives and 
strategies  – what do they all mean?
Th e links between these concepts can be made clearer by 
studying this ‘hierarchy of objectives’ ( Figure 4.1), which 
shows, visually, the balance and dependencies between the 
diff erent stages in the setting of aims and objectives. Later 
in this chapter we will consider the importance of these 
objectives to business strategies.Corporate aims
Th ese are the very long-term goals that a business hopes 
to achieve. Th e core central purpose of a business’s 
activity is expressed in its corporate aims. Sole traders 
and partnerships  – not just companies  – will also 
commonly develop the same kind of long-term vision for 
their  business.
Th e case study demonstrates a typical corporate 
aim. Daimler Mercedes-Benz tells us that it aims to 
achieve pro fi table growth by continuing to play a leading 
role in the automobile industry. Other corporate aims 
tend to concentrate on customer-based goals  – such as 
‘meeting customers’ needs’  – or market-based goals  – 
such as ‘becoming the world leader’. All corporate aims 
have certain characteristics in common. Th ey are all-

This chapter delves into AS Level syllabus section 1.4, outlining the significance of business objectives. It articulates that while businesses may state the general objectives in their Memorandum of Association, strategic details are often scant. The chapter aims to shed light on why business objectives are imperative, the variety of goals that can exist, and how they can serve in guiding an organization’s workforce. Objectives provide clarity and a distinct direction for nearly all human endeavors. For businesses, an objective can streamline management, guide decision-making, and warrant that all company actions are aligned with the established targets. 

@@@Understanding the Importance of SMART Objectives
Upon completing this chapter, the reader will comprehend the importance of setting objectives and the necessity for them to be SMART—Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Readers will also gain insights into the connections between mission statements, corporate objectives, and business strategy, the dynamics between objectives and strategies, and the significance of conveying objectives to stakeholders like employees. Moreover, the chapter discusses why objectives may evolve over time and critically examines the influence of corporate social responsibility and ethics on business aims and activities.

@@@Case Study: Health and Beauty for You
June Wong reflects on the success of Health and Beauty for You, which she started with her brother Will. Despite economic challenges and competition, their primary goal of business survival was met over the initial three years. Subsequently, they plan to set new objectives, with June proposing expansion through acquiring another salon to bolster growth, while Will advocates for maximizing profits from the current salon. Through discussion, they arrive at a dual-phase objective: initially, to open a new salon and double sales within three years; subsequently, to focus on long-term profit maximization by enhancing their image and raising prices—with a five-year profit target of $90,000 per year.

@@@Points to Ponder and Case Continuation
The reader is prompted to reflect on the definition of 'objective', the importance of Health and Beauty for You having clear objectives, and the reasons behind June and Will’s prospective shift in business goals over time. Following this, the text details that businesses, from small sole-trader enterprises to large corporations, benefit from clear and well-defined objectives. While sole traders might not formalize their goals, they typically have a clear vision. The importance of aligned objectives for partnerships and the necessity for limited companies to declare their overarching business objectives are highlighted. Businesses need to frequently review their strategies to ensure continuous alignment with objectives, acknowledging that objectives and strategies may change with time; for example, a shift in objective likely necessitates a revised strategy.

@@@Exploring the Attributes of Effective Business Objectives
The text then details that the most effective business objectives are characterized by the SMART criteria, providing specific examples for each of the 'SMART' components. It emphasizes setting specific goals pertinent to a business’s nature, establishing measurable targets, ensuring objectives are realistically achievable, aligning them with the company’s resources, and setting clear time frames.

@@@Understanding the Hierarchy of Business Objectives and Strategies
An analysis follows on the distinction between corporate aims, mission statements, objectives, and strategies, exemplified through a hierarchy of objectives figure. The case of Daimler Mercedes-Benz is presented, showcasing a corporate goal of achieving profitable growth and leading the automobile industry. Corporate aims are discussed as broad and overarching, providing directional guidance across the various aspects and levels of a business. The reader is engaged through an activity to explain the benefits of company aims and objectives to Daimler, complementing the detailed exploration of business objectives provided in the chapter."

Eff ective decision-making requires clear objectives. 
Business managers cannot decide on future plans 
of action  – strategies  – if they are uncertain of 
which direction they want to take the business in.

How corporate objectives might change
Th ere are many examples of businesses changing their 
corporate objectives over time. Th ese are some of the 
reasons for this:

so the entry into the market of a powerful rival or the start 
of an economic recession may lead a firm to switch from 
growth to survival as its main aim  – or even just to revise its 
objectives for sales and profits downwards.
3 A short-term objective of growth in sales or market share 
might be adapted to a longer-term objective of maximising 
profits from the higher level of sales.
Factors that determine the corporate 
objectives of a business
Corporate culture
Clearly, not all businesses pursue the same objectives. 
Th ere are several factors that in fl uence the nature of the 
objectives established for any business. Chief among these 
is the culture of the organisation. Th is can be de fi ned 
as the code of behaviour and attitudes that in fl uence 
the decision-making style of the managers and other 
employees of the business. Culture is a way of doing things 
that is shared by all those in the organisation. Culture is 
about people, how they perform and deal with others, how 
aggressive they are in the pursuit of objectives and how 
adaptable they are in the face of change. If directors are 
aggressive in pursuit of their aims, are keen to take over 
or defeat rival businesses and care little about social or 
environmental factors, then the objectives of the business 
will be very di ff erent to those of a business owned and 
controlled by directors with a more people- or social-
oriented culture.
The size and legal form of the business
Owners of small businesses may be concerned only with 
a satisfactory level of pro fi t – called ‘satis fi cing’. Larger 
businesses, perhaps controlled by directors rather than 
owners, such as most public limited companies, might 
be more concerned with rapid business growth in order 
to increase the status and power of the managers. Th i s  
is oft en a result of a development known as the ‘divorce 
between ownership and control’, which nearly always 
exists in large companies with professional directors 
who do not own it. Th ey may be more concerned about 
their bonuses, salaries and fringe bene fi ts – which o ft en 
depend on business size  – than on maximising returns to 
shareholders.
Public-sector or private-sector businesses
State-owned organisations tend not to have profit as a 
major objective. The aims of these organisations can 
vary greatly, but when the service they provide is not 
charged for, such as education and health services, 
then a financial target would be inappropriate. Figure 4.4 A decision-making framework<Insert figure 4.4>

Effective decision-making in business management is deeply tied to having clear objectives. Managers are tasked with crafting future strategies, which can only be accomplished with a well-defined direction for the business. This crucial relationship between decisions and business objectives is encapsulated in the decision-making framework model depicted in Figure 4.4. The framework for making decisions involves a multi-step process, which includes setting objectives, assessing the problem or situation, gathering relevant data, evaluating decision options, making the strategic decision, implementing the plan, and reviewing its success in the context of the original goals. Without these objectives outlined from the beginning, making any influential decisions for the future of the business would not only be challenging but also unproductive.

@@@The Evolution of Corporate Objectives Over Time
Corporate objectives do not remain static and often evolve, driven by various circumstances. A startup, having achieved initial survival objectives, may shift focus to scaling or profit maximization. Market dynamics such as the emergence of a formidable competitor or economic downturns can compel a firm to adjust its objectives, shifting from aggressive expansion back to mere survival or revising sales and profit goals downwards. Short-term growth ambitions, such as increasing sales or market share, may transform into long-term profit-maximization aims once a higher sales level is attained.

@@@Determinants of a Business's Corporate Objectives
A myriad of factors can sway the specific objectives set by a business. Corporate culture stands out as a key influencer – it embodies the shared attitudes and behaviors that guide the decision-making of managers and employees within an organization. Depending on whether the corporate culture is aggressive and competitive or socially conscious and people-oriented, the business's objectives will significantly vary. Moreover, the size and legal structure of a business play vital roles; smaller companies often pursue a satisfactory profit level, while larger enterprises, especially those separated from owner management, may prioritize growth for increased managerial prestige and benefits. Public-sector organizations usually don’t target profit maximization due to the nature of their services which are frequently non-profit-driven like education and health. Figure 4.4 showcases a decision-making framework, with its stages from objective setting to review against objectives, implying the diverse factors that can shape business objectives."

interesting contrast.
The number of years the business has been 
operating
Newly formed businesses are likely to be driven by the 
desire to survive at all costs  – the failure rate of new fi rms 
in the fi rst year of operation is very high. Later, once well 
established, the business may pursue other objectives, such 
as growth and pro fi t. Th ese factors are summarised in 
Figure 4.5.
Divisional, departmental and individual 
objectives
Refer to Figure 4.6 . Once corporate objectives have been 
established they need to be broken down into speci fi c 
targets for separate divisions, departments and, ultimately, 
individuals. Corporate objectives relate to the whole 
organisation. Th ey cannot be used by each division of 
the business to create strategies for action until they have 
been broken down into meaningful targets focusing on divisional goals. Th ese divisional objectives must be set by 
senior managers to ensure:
■ coordination between all divisions  – if they do not work 
together, the focus of the organisation will appear confused 
to outsiders and there will be disagreements between 
departments
■ consistency with corporate objectives

Once the divisional objectives have been established, then 
these can be further divided into departmental objectives 
and budgets and targets for individual workers. Th i s  
process is called management by objectives (MBO).
Management by objectives (MBO)
If this process is undertaken a ft er discussion and 
agreement with personnel at each level of the organisation, 
then it can be a very e ff ective way of delegating authority 
and motivating sta ff . Th is approach would accord with 
McGregor’s Th eory Y approach (see Chapter 11). If, 
however, the targets at each level were merely imposed

These are all examples of ethical dilemmas. The way

ethical code of conduct. To what extent should and do

■ Employees and managers achieving more  – through 
greater understanding of both individual and company-

■ Employees seeing the overall plan  – and understanding 
how their individual goals fit into the company’s business 
objectives.
■ Creating shared employee responsibility  – by interlinking 
their goals with others in the company.

Effective decision-making requires clear objectives. Business managers cannot decide on future plans of action – strategies – if they are uncertain of which direction they want to take the business in. This essential link between decisions and objectives is illustrated in the decision-making framework model shown in Figure 4.4. The stages in this decision-making framework are: 1. Set objectives. 2. Assess the problem or situation. 3. Gather data about the problem and possible solutions. 4. Consider all decision options. 5. Make the strategic decision. 6. Plan and implement the decision. 7. Review its success against the original objectives. Clearly, without setting relevant objectives at the start of this process, effective decision-making for the future of the business becomes impossible.

@@@The Evolution of Corporate Objectives
There are many examples of businesses changing their corporate objectives over time. These are some of the reasons for this: 1. A newly formed business may have satisfied the ‘survival’ objective by operating for several years, and now the owners wish to pursue objectives of growth or increased profit. 2. The competitive and economic environment may change, so the entry into the market of a powerful rival or the start of an economic recession may lead a firm to switch from growth to survival as its main aim – or even just to revise its objectives for sales and profits downwards. 3. A short-term objective of growth in sales or market share might be adapted to a longer-term objective of maximizing profits from the higher level of sales.

@@@Factors Influencing Corporate Objectives
Several factors influence the nature of the objectives established for any business. The corporate culture is a chief among these and can be defined as the code of behavior and attitudes that influence the decision-making style of the managers and other employees of the business. The size and legal form of the business also play a role, with small business owners possibly aiming for satisfactory profit or 'satisficing', while larger businesses may strive for rapid growth to increase the status and power of managers. This is often a result of the ‘divorce between ownership and control,’ which nearly always exists in large companies with professional directors who do not own it. Additionally, public-sector and private-sector businesses have different focuses, with state-owned organizations not prioritizing profit and possibly setting objectives like 'quality of service' measures. Contrastingly, businesses earning revenue in the public sector may aim to maintain services in non-profitable locations.

@@@Impact of Ethical Considerations on Objectives and Decision-Making
Ethics play a significant role in shaping business objectives and decision-making. Businesses face ethical dilemmas such as whether to use aggressive marketing to children, accept bribes, support ethically controversial industries, employ environmentally-friendly practices at the expense of profits, or address issues related to pay inequality and labor conditions. The ethical code or code of conduct of a company details the mandatory behavior and guidelines that all employees must follow. The growing acceptance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) has led to more businesses considering the ethical implications of their actions in making decisions that extend beyond just profit impact.

@@@Dissemination and Management of Objectives Within the Business
Communicating business objectives to employees is essential. If employees are unaware of the company goals, they cannot contribute efficiently to achieving them. By involving employees in the setting of objectives and clearly communicating business goals, the business is likely to benefit from enhanced employee performance through a greater understanding of both their individual and the company's collective goals. A clear objectives framework aligns employee responsibilities and facilitates monitoring and support by management. Knowledge of objectives helps employees see the bigger picture and understand their role, which is critical for the company to operate cohesively and achieve its mission. This process of cascading goals is referred to as management by objectives (MBO), wherein corporate aims are divided into specific targets at every level of the organization: aim, corporate objectives, divisional objectives, departmental objectives, and individual targets, ensuring alignment and coordination between all levels for successful achievement."

8●●Prokaryotes
All bacterial cells are prokaryotic, which means that all bacteria are 
prokaryotes. Evolutionary evidence suggests that prokaryotes evolved 
much earlier than eukaryotic cells.
Prokaryotes:
● are single celled
● do not have a nucleus containing their genetic material (DNA)
● are smaller than eukaryotic cells.
Individual bacterial cells are usually between 1 µm and 10 µm in length. 
One thousand micrometres (µm) make up one millimetre (mm). This means 
that between 100 and 1000 bacteria will fit in a straight line in 1 mm. 
Groups of bacterial cells, called colonies, are shown in Figure 1.2. Many, but not all, scientists think that prokaryotes evolved before eukaryotes and 
so are missing some cell components that eukaryotic cells possess. These 
scientists think that prokaryotes first appeared about 3.5 billion years ago, 
which is only one billion years after the Earth’s crust formed.
If the last 4.6 billion years were scaled down into an hour, Figure 1.3 
shows when the first prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms are likely to 
have evolved. Humans have actually only been present for the last few 
seconds of the last minute, so not long at all!

Cell wall Like those of plants and fungi, bacterial cells have a cell wall to provide support. However, unlike plant cell walls this is not made of cellulose. The cell membrane is found on the inside surface of the cell wall.
Single DNA loop (not in chromosomes)DNA in prokaryotes is not arranged in complex chromosomes  
like in eukaryotic cells. It is not held within a nucleus.
Plasmid DNA These are small, circular sections of DNA that can move from one cell to another. They provide genetic variation for bacteria.
Flagellum This is a whip-like structure that helps many prokaryotes to move by rotating or flicking (like a whip).
Cell-surface membrane This controls what substances go in and out of a cell. It also has internal extensions that have enzymes attached to them. Respiration  occurs in these enzymes. Prokaryotic cells do 
not have mitochondria , which is where respiration occurs in 
eukaryotic cells.
Ribosome Proteins are made from amino acids in ribosomes, which are present in the cytoplasm.

","@@@Introduction to Prokaryotes and the Scale of Evolution

1 Cell biology explores various types of cells, including prokaryotes. The text explains that all bacterial cells are prokaryotic, indicating that bacteria fall under this category. Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms without a nucleus to contain their genetic material, and they are often smaller than eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes potentially evolved earlier than eukaryotic cells, as suggested by evolutionary evidence. With individual bacterial cells typically ranging between 1 µm and 10 µm in length, understanding the size comparison is vital; 1000 micrometres (µm) equal one millimetre (mm), translating to hundreds of bacteria that can fit within this small space. Despite their size, prokaryotes are significant in the history of life. Some scientists believe prokaryotes appeared about 3.5 billion years ago, relatively shortly after the Earth's crust formed. A visualization scale demonstrates the proportion of time various organisms, including prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, fish, land plants, and humans, have been present in the grand timeline. Key terms like ""Prokaryotic cells"" and ""Prokaryote"" are also defined for clarity.

@@@Understanding Bacterial Cell Composition and Size Comparison

9 A typical bacterial cell, a prokaryote, can be viewed as represented in Figure 1.4, which magnifies its structure and showcases its components. The functions of bacterial cell components such as the cytoplasm, cell wall, DNA, plasmid DNA, flagellum, cell-surface membrane, and ribosomes are highlighted in Table 1.1. Each component has a crucial role from providing cell support, enabling genetic variation, aiding in cell movement, controlling substance exchange, to facilitating respiration and protein synthesis. This section elucidates that bacterial prokaryotic cells lack mitochondria for respiration, a feature present in eukaryotic cells. Another visual representation, Figure 1.5, offers a perspective on the size of bacterial cells compared to a pinhead, underscoring the microscopic scale of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Additional tips aim to reinforce learning about cell structures while key terms like ""Chromosome,"" ""Mitochondrion,"" and ""Respiration"" are explained. Lastly, questions for self-assessment encourage readers to reflect on the unique characteristics of prokaryotic cells, the types of organisms with a single loop of DNA, differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, the role of ribosomes, and the reasoning behind the hypothesis that prokaryotic cells evolved first."

10Animal and plant cells
●●Generalised animal cells
Plant and animal cells are eukaryotic. They can be unicellular or belong 
to multicellular organisms. Eukaryotic cells almost always have a 
nucleus and are generally larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells.
The structure of a generalised animal cell is shown in Figure 1.6. 
A generalised cell is one that has been simplified to make the key 
components easier to identify.
▲ Figure 1.6 A generalised animal cell as seen with a microscope (magnified ×4800) 
and as three- and two-dimensional diagrams.
Components of animal cells
In the previous section we looked at bacterial cells. Animal cells have 
many components in common with these. The cytoplasm of animal cells 
is also mainly water and it holds other components such as ribosomes. 
In the cytoplasm most of the chemical reactions in the cell happen 
(such as the making of proteins in ribosomes).
The cell-surface membrane of animal cells also surrounds the cell. There 
are no cell walls in animal cells and so the membrane is on the outside 
of these cells. The membrane controls what substances go in and out of 
the cell. Many cells need glucose and oxygen for respiration, and these 
substances move by diffusion into the cell from the blood, where it is 
found at a higher concentration. Carbon dioxide moves back into the 
blood capillaries through the membrane.
Mitochondria are small organelles found in the cytoplasm and are 
only present in eukaryotic cells. They are the site of most of a cell’s 
respiration. Here the energy stored in glucose is released for the cell 
to complete the seven life processes. Without this energy all cells die. 
More-active cells such as those in muscles or sperm cells usually have 
more mitochondria because these cells need more energy. Mitochondria 
have many folds inside them, which make their surface area very large 
to increase the rate at which energy is released.
Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. These organelles are 
present in the cytoplasm of animal cells.
KEy TERM

of particles from an area of high 
concentration to an area of lower concentration.

Animal and plant cells
11Animal cells are unlike bacterial cells in that they usually possess a 
nucleus. This component is present in almost all eukaryotic cells. It is 
found in the cytoplasm and is surrounded by its own membrane. The 
cell’s genetic material (DNA) is enclosed within it, arranged into shapes 
called chromosomes. (Red blood cells do not have a nucleus, so they 
have more room to absorb and carry the maximum amount of oxygen, 
which is their main function.)
Humans are of course classified as animals. Many of our cells are like 
other animal cells.
●●Generalised plant cells
Like those belonging to animals, plant cells are eukaryotic. This means that 
they may belong to single-celled or multicellular organisms, they do have a 
nucleus and they are generally larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells.

and as three- and two-dimensional diagrams.
Components of plant cells
Plant cells have many components in common with animal cells, 
including a nucleus in which the organism’s genetic material (DNA) 
is found. Plant cells also possess ribosomes for protein synthesis and 
mitochondria for respiration in their cytoplasm.
Plant cells possess some components not present in animal cells. 
Chloroplasts are small components, full of a green pigment called 
chlorophyll which is necessary for photosynthesis to occur. This reaction 
uses light energy from the Sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into 
glucose and oxygen and so provides an energy source for the plant. It is 
the green chlorophyll in plants that gives some of their parts their green 
colour. Most roots are hidden from the Sun and so cannot photosynthesise. 
They do not have chloroplasts and so are often white, not green.
There are huge numbers of chloroplasts in leaf cells. There are often 
well over half a million per square millimetre of leaf.
Plant cells also possess a cell wall, unlike animal cells. This is made 
from cellulose and provides structure for the cell. Plants would not be 
able to stand upright to catch light energy from the Sun without cell 
walls. The cell surface membrane is found inside the cell wall.

","@@@Introduction to Cell Biology: Understanding Animal and Plant Cells

Plant and animal cells are eukaryotic, meaning they may consist of single or multiple cells and contain a nucleus, generally being larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells. A simplified animal cell structure is depicted in Figure 1.6, designed to highlight key components for easier identification. Both types of cells are explored, including a visualization of a generalised animal cell at a microscopic level, shown both three- and two-dimensionally.

@@@Key Components of Animal Cells and Their Functions

Animal cells share several components with bacterial cells, as seen in the cytoplasm, which contains mainly water, ribosomes, and is the site for numerous chemical reactions, like protein synthesis. The cell-surface membrane of animal cells, which lacks a cell wall, is the outermost part of these cells and regulates the inflow and outflow of substances, such as gases and nutrients, by diffusion. Mitochondria, eukaryotic cell-specific organelles, serve as the primary sites of cellular respiration, releasing energy for vital life processes. Their high-energy demand is indicated by the abundance of mitochondria in cells that perform intense activities. In comparison, ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis, with the term 'Diffusion' being defined as the movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to one of lower concentration. The paragraph also emphasizes the uniqueness of animal cells due to their possession of nuclei and different components within the cytoplasm compared to bacterial cells.

@@@Characteristics of Generalized Plant Cells

Like animal cells, plant cells are also eukaryotic with a nucleus and comparatively larger than bacterial cells. Figure 1.7 illustrates a generalized plant cell under microscopic magnification, including both three-dimensional and two-dimensional representations.

@@@Unique Components in Plant Cells

The structure and function of plant cells are described, highlighting the similarities they share with animal cells like possessing a nucleus with DNA, ribosomes, and mitochondria. However, plant cells also contain unique components, such as chloroplasts filled with chlorophyll, necessary for photosynthesis, through which light energy is used to create glucose and oxygen. Plant cells also exhibit cell walls made of cellulose, providing structural support essential for the plants to remain upright and capture sunlight. Photosynthesis is defined as the endothermic reaction storing energy in glucose. Additionally, plant cells often contain a large, central vacuole that helps maintain the cell's turgidity. The term 'Turgid' refers to the state of being swollen in cells.

@@@Examining Plant Cells Through Practical Observation

A detailed method for scrutinizing the cells of onions and pond weed under a microscope is presented, offering step-by-step procedural instructions. It concludes with a set of questions aimed at differentiating between the observed cells of the two specimens and inquiring about the organelles typically absent in animal cells. In addition to the practical tips and questions, a series of test questions are posed to reinforce learning and understanding about the structures unique to plant cells, the occurrence of mitochondria, and the roles of the cytoplasm and mitochondria. The section concludes with an explanation of why sperm cells harbor a large number of mitochondria."
8,"Cell specialisation
13Cell specialisation
The previous section looked at generalised animal and plant cells. 
Eukaryotic organisms, like us, are not usually made of generalised 
cells. We have developed specialised cells that have adaptations 
to allow them to complete specific functions. Red blood cells, for 
example, have a biconcave shape (which dips in the middle on both 
sides) and no nucleus to maximise their surface area to absorb more 
oxygen. Key specialised cells for animals and plants, together with their 
adaptations, are listed below.
●●Sperm cell
In humans, during a male orgasm about a teaspoon of semen is ejaculated. Within this are tens of millions of sperm cells, which must 
swim through the cervix and uterus to the fallopian tubes. Here one 
cell may fertilise an egg cell (ovum). Sperm cells have a tail to propel 
them towards the ovum (Figure 1.10). They have a relatively large 
number of mitochondria to release the energy from glucose during 
respiration. This is needed to keep them swimming. The nucleus of a 
human sperm contains the genetic material (DNA) of the father. This 
will make up half of the DNA of the baby. At the front of a sperm is an 
acrosome. This contains digestive enzymes, which break down the outer 
layer of the ovum, allowing the sperm to enter and fertilise it.
●●Nerve cell
Our nervous system controls and coordinates all our actions. These 
can be either voluntary actions (like picking up the television remote 
control) or involuntary actions (like our heart beating faster when we 
exercise). There are two main parts to our nervous system. The first is 
our central nervous system (CNS), which is made up of our brain and 
spinal cord. The other is our peripheral nervous system (PNS), which is  
all the other nerve cells that connect to the CNS but then spread out across the body. To control our actions, signals must be sent and received. These 
signals are electrical impulses that travel along nerve cells.  acrosome

Biconcave  Used to describe a shape 
with a dip that curves inwards on both 
sides.
TIP
If you are asked to explain how a cell is adapted to its function, don’t forget to use a connecting phrase like ‘so that it 
can’ or ‘to allow it to’.
▲ Figure 1.10 The parts of a sperm cell.
▲ Figure 1.11 The parts of a nerve cell.1 Cell biology
14To keep these signals moving quickly, some of our nerve cells are the 
longest cells in our body. Their long extensions are called axons and these 
have a myelin sheath surrounding much of their length (Figure 1.11). 
This acts like the plastic coating on an electrical wire and insulates the 
electrical impulse. The cell body of the nerve also has smaller extensions 
called dendrites, which allow it to pick up signals from neighbouring cells.
●●Muscle cell
▲ Figure 1.13 The three types of muscle.
There are three types of muscle in our bodies, all of which can contract and relax. Smooth muscle contracts and relaxes automatically and 
is found in places such as the linings of the vessels that make up 
our circulatory system and the iris of our eyes. Cardiac muscle also 
contracts and relaxes automatically and is found in our heart. The third 
type is skeletal muscle, which is usually found attached to our bones. 
We control the contractions of this type of muscle, so its movements 
are not automatic.
All three types of muscle are made from muscle cells (Figure 1.13). 
These are long thin cells full of mitochondria. In the mitochondria the 
energy from glucose is released during respiration. This energy allows 
the muscle to keep on contracting.
●●Root hair cell
Root hair cells have a small thin extension, which pokes out into the soil (Figure 1.14). Many plants 
have such high numbers of long root hairs that they 
can look like a spider’s web. The purpose of these 
hairs is to increase the surface area of the root that 
is in contact with the soil. This allows the plant to 
absorb more water and minerals from the soil. A 
single rye plant has billions of root hairs, which have 
a total length of hundreds of miles. Without these 
it is likely that the adult plant would not be able to 
absorb enough water to survive.

15●●Xylem cell
Xylem cells form long tubes running along the stem or trunk of plants. 
They are strengthened by lignin fibres. They carry water and some 
dissolved minerals from the roots upwards to other parts of the plant. 
This water evaporates and is lost from leaves as water vapour during 
the continual process of transpiration. It is also used in the green 
parts of plants for photosynthesis during the day. Xylem tubes are made 
from lots of individual cells that have died. The ends of these cells 
erode away, leaving long tubes through which water is naturally drawn 
upwards (Figure 1.15). They have reinforced cell walls to support the 
weight of the plant.
●●Phloem cell
Phloem cells carry the glucose (as sucrose) made in photosynthesis from the leaves of a plant to all other parts of the plant in cell sap. This process 
is called translocation. The sugar is used immediately in respiration to 
release energy for the plant or is stored as starch in cells or particularly in structures such as the roots of 
vegetables. Unlike xylem, phloem cells are living. They 
have fewer cell organelles than many other types of 
cell, which allows the sugar to travel easily. Connecting 
adjacent phloem cells are sieve plates. These have small 
holes to speed up translocation (Figure 1.16).
Phloem cells are arranged with xylem cells to form 
bundles. These make up the veins you can see in a leaf (Figure 1.17).

transporting water to the leaf and phloem tubes transporting sugars away from it.

16●●Cell differentiation
The previous two sections have looked at generalised and specialised 
animal and plant cells. After generalised cells are formed they become 
specialised as an organism develops. This process is called cell 
differentiation. Your cells did this while you were in your mother’s 
uterus. Part of this process involves cells developing specific structures 
within them to allow them to function. For example, muscle cells need 
to release lots of energy during respiration and so require a high number 
of mitochondria. Unlike animal cells, most plant cells retain the ability 
to differentiate throughout their life. We would not be able to take plant 
cuttings without this. You will learn about this in Chapter 14.
Microscopy
It is not very easy to know who invented the first microscope or exactly when this happened. It is likely to have occurred in the 1590s in the 
Netherlands by makers of eye glasses. Seventy-five years later, in 1665, 
English scientist Robert Hooke published a book called Micrographia, 
which was full of impressive images including a drawing of the eyes 
of a fly using a microscope. In this book he first used the word ‘cell’, 
because when he looked at plant cells using his microscope he was 
reminded of the cells in a honeycomb.
A decade later, in the mid-1670s, a Dutch scientist called van 
Leeuwenhoek discovered sperm cells and then single-celled bacteria 
from a human mouth. This was a tremendously important development 
in science, because before this no one had ever seen a single-celled organism. Imagine not knowing that bacteria and single-celled fungi 
existed!

","@@@Introduction to Cell Specialisation  
The previous section examined generalised animal and plant cells. However, eukaryotic organisms like humans are composed of specialised cells uniquely tailored to perform specific functions. Red blood cells are an example; their biconcave shape and the absence of a nucleus optimise their oxygen absorption. This section will detail key specialised cells in animals and plants, highlighting their particular adaptations.

@@@Sperm Cell Specialization  
During male ejaculation, semen containing tens of millions of sperm cells is released. These sperm cells must swim through the cervix into the fallopian tubes, where they may fertilize an egg cell. To enable this journey, sperm cells are equipped with a tail for propulsion and numerous mitochondria to release energy from glucose during respiration. This energy is essential for their persistent movement. The nucleus carries the paternal genetic material, half of what will become the offspring's DNA. At the sperm's forefront is an acrosome containing digestive enzymes that can penetrate an ovum's outer layer, facilitating fertilization (Figure 1.10).

@@@Nerve Cell Function and Structure  
The nervous system, comprising the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), oversees both voluntary and involuntary body actions. The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord, while the PNS incorporates nerve cells that connect to the CNS and spread throughout the body. Electrical impulses travel along nerve cells, conducting vital signals. Some nerve cells have extensive axons insulated by myelin sheaths to expedite signal transmission, reflecting the importance of speed in nerve signal relay. The nerve cell body also possesses dendrites to receive signals from adjacent cells (Figure 1.11).

@@@Muscle Cell Types and Adaptations  
Our bodies have three muscle types: smooth, cardiac, and skeletal. Smooth muscle, found in the circulatory system and iris, contracts automatically, as does cardiac muscle in the heart. In contrast, skeletal muscle, usually attached to bones, is under voluntary control. Muscle cells possess abundant mitochondria to harness glucose's energy during respiration, enabling sustained contraction (Figure 1.13).

@@@Root Hair Cell Structure  
Root hair cells extend into the soil to maximize the root's surface area in contact with the soil, allowing plants to absorb more water and minerals. The extensive network of these hair-like structures facilitates vital water uptake (Figure 1.14).

@@@Xylem and Phloem Cell Functions  
Xylem cells, forming long tubes fortified with lignin fibers, transport water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant. Meanwhile, phloem cells move glucose from photosynthesis throughout the plant for immediate use or storage. Xylem tubes consist of dead cells that merge to create channels for water transmission, while phloem cells, being living, feature sieve plates to speed up sugar transport (Figures 1.15 and 1.16).

@@@Cell Differentiation Process  
After formation, generalized cells become specialized through cell differentiation. This occurs as an organism develops, with cells acquiring specific internal structures to perform distinct functions. For example, muscle cells contain numerous mitochondria to meet their energy demands during respiration. Notably, most plant cells retain the capacity to differentiate for their entire lifespan, a property essential for practices like taking plant cuttings (Chapter 14 to be covered later).

@@@Microscopy's Historical Development  
Although the exact origin of the microscope is unclear, it likely arose in the 1590s in The Netherlands among eyeglass makers. Significant advancements include Robert Hooke's usage of 'cell' in 1665 from his observations in Micrographia, and van Leeuwenhoek's later discovery of sperm cells and bacteria. These developments revolutionized scientific understanding by revealing single-celled organisms previously unknown (Figure 1.18).

@@@Test Yourself and Application of Knowledge  
To assess comprehension, several questions prompt the reader to state the functions of nerve cells, enumerate their components, and describe red blood cells' and root hair cells' adaptations. Another task challenges the reader to explain why animals and plants possess specialized cells. A tip is provided for optimizing microscope use, highlighting the importance of this tool in cell biology."

Microscopy
17The microscopes used by Robert Hooke and van Leeuwenhoek looked 
very different from those that you may use in your science lessons 
today. But the thing they have in common is that they all use 
magnifying lenses to enlarge images.
●●Light microscopes
The parts of a light microscope and their functions are shown in Table 1.2.
Table 1.2 The functions of the parts of a light microscope.
Part Function
Eyepiece lens You will look through this lens to see your sample. This is often ×10.
Objective lens Usually there are three to choose from (often ×5, ×10 and ×25). The 
smallest will be the easiest to focus, so select this first. When you have focused this lens try a different one with a greater magnification.
Stage This holds the sample securely, often using two metal clips.
Specimen This is usually placed in a drop of water or stain on a microscope slide under a very thin glass cover slip.
Mirror This reflects the light up through the sample, and then the objective and eyepiece lenses into your eyes.
Course focus This quickly and easily moves the stage up and down to focus on the sample.
Fine focus This sensitively and slowly moves the stage up and down to allow you to make your image very sharp.
The total magnification of the image you are looking at is calculated by:
total magnification =  magnification of × magnification of  
   eyepiece lens       objective lens
●●Electron microscopes
Electron microscopes use electrons in place of rays of light to 
make an image (Figure 1.19). The wavelength of electrons can be 
up to 100 000 times smaller than that of visible light. This means 
that electron microscopes can take images at significantly higher magnifications. The first electron microscope was made by German 
scientists Ernst Ruska (1906–1988) and Max Knoll (1897–1969) in 
1931. This was a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Several years 
later, in 1937, German scientist Manfred von Ardenne (1907–1997) 
invented a second type called a scanning electron microscope (SEM).

18Transmission electron microscopes fire a large beam of electrons though 
a very thin slice of the specimen. All electrons are fired at the same 
time. Not all of the electrons pass though the specimen. The image is 
made from only those electrons that do.
Scanning electron microscopes also use a beam of electrons. This beam 
is much smaller and scans across the whole image but not all at the 
same time. Electrons scatter from the surface of the sample and are 
detected to make an image.
As a consequence of their different methods of working, the images that 
these two microscopes take are very different from each other. Images from 
transmission electron microscopes are flat and are usually taken in cross-
section through a specimen. That is, they are frequently used to look at 
a section through a cell. Scanning electron microscopes don’t need thin 
samples so can be used to take images that look more three-dimensional. 
All electron microscope images are black and white. On occasions scientists 
colour these images to make them look more striking (Figure 1.20).
The resolution of microscopes is defined as the shortest distance 
between two parts of a specimen that can be seen as two distinctly 
separate points. As a result of the wavelength of light the maximum 
resolution of light microscopes is 200 nm. (There are one million 
nanometres (nm) in a millimetre.) The wavelength of electrons is shorter than that of light, and so much closer points can be resolved. 
An electron microscope can resolve points up to 2000 times closer than 
a light microscope, at a separation of just 0.1 nm.

between two separate points.

","@@@CELL BIOLOGY AND CELL DIFFERENTIATION
Cell biology explores the diverse functionalities and structures of cells. A crucial aspect of this field is cell differentiation, a process through which generalized cells become specialized to perform specific functions during an organism's development. This specialization allows cells to acquire unique structures that enable them to execute their designated roles efficiently. For instance, muscle cells develop numerous mitochondria to meet their high energy demands during respiration. In contrast to animal cells, which lose the ability to differentiate after a certain stage, plant cells can continue to differentiate throughout their lives, a trait essential for practices like taking plant cuttings.

@@@MICROSCOPY: A HISTORICAL OVERVIEW
The origins of microscopy are not crystal clear, but the first microscope is thought to have been created in the 1590s by Dutch eyeglass makers. A significant leap came in 1665 when Robert Hooke’s publication, ""Micrographia,"" introduced the term 'cell' after observing plant cells reminiscent of a honeycomb's cells. Later, in the mid-1670s, scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered sperm cells and bacteria, vastly expanding the understanding of single-celled organisms.

@@@PRACTICAL MICROSCOPY TIPS AND COMPONENTS OF LIGHT MICROSCOPES
Modern microscopes may look different from the early iterations used by Hooke and van Leeuwenhoek, but the commonality lies in their use of magnifying lenses. A light microscope has several key parts highlighted in Table 1.2. The eyepiece lens and objective lenses of varying magnification, stage, specimen placement, lighting mirrors, and focus adjustments all play fundamental roles in the microscopy process. The total magnification of an observed sample is determined by multiplying the magnifications of the eyepiece and objective lenses.

@@@ADVANCEMENTS IN MICROSCOPY: ELECTRON MICROSCOPES
The development of electron microscopes, initiated by Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll's transmission electron microscope (TEM) in 1931, marked a significant progress in microscopic technology. Later, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) by Manfred von Ardenne allowed for detailed three-dimensional imaging. Electron microscopes operate using beams of electrons resulting in much higher magnification and resolution compared to light microscopes. The TEM provides flat, cross-sectional images, while the SEM delivers more three-dimensional representations. Despite their monochromatic output, electron microscope images are sometimes colorized for visual impact. The concept of resolution, the smallest distinguishable distance between two points, is substantially enhanced in electron microscopes, achieving separation of as little as 0.1 nm compared to the 200 nm resolution limit of light microscopes."

●●Generalised animal cells
Plant and animal cells are eukaryotic. They can be unicellular or belong 
to multicellular organisms. Eukaryotic cells almost always have a 
nucleus and are generally larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells.
The structure of a generalised animal cell is shown in Figure 1.6. 
A generalised cell is one that has been simplified to make the key 
components easier to identify.
▲ Figure 1.6 A generalised animal cell as seen with a microscope (magnified ×4800) 
and as three- and two-dimensional diagrams.
Components of animal cells
In the previous section we looked at bacterial cells. Animal cells have 
many components in common with these. The cytoplasm of animal cells 
is also mainly water and it holds other components such as ribosomes. 
In the cytoplasm most of the chemical reactions in the cell happen 
(such as the making of proteins in ribosomes).
The cell-surface membrane of animal cells also surrounds the cell. There 
are no cell walls in animal cells and so the membrane is on the outside 
of these cells. The membrane controls what substances go in and out of 
the cell. Many cells need glucose and oxygen for respiration, and these 
substances move by diffusion into the cell from the blood, where it is 
found at a higher concentration. Carbon dioxide moves back into the 
blood capillaries through the membrane.
Mitochondria are small organelles found in the cytoplasm and are 
only present in eukaryotic cells. They are the site of most of a cell’s 
respiration. Here the energy stored in glucose is released for the cell 
to complete the seven life processes. Without this energy all cells die. 
More-active cells such as those in muscles or sperm cells usually have 
more mitochondria because these cells need more energy. Mitochondria 
have many folds inside them, which make their surface area very large 
to increase the rate at which energy is released.
Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. These organelles are 
present in the cytoplasm of animal cells.

of particles from an area of high

11Animal cells are unlike bacterial cells in that they usually possess a 
nucleus. This component is present in almost all eukaryotic cells. It is 
found in the cytoplasm and is surrounded by its own membrane. The 
cell’s genetic material (DNA) is enclosed within it, arranged into shapes 
called chromosomes. (Red blood cells do not have a nucleus, so they 
have more room to absorb and carry the maximum amount of oxygen, 
which is their main function.)
Humans are of course classified as animals. Many of our cells are like 
other animal cells.
●●Generalised plant cells
Like those belonging to animals, plant cells are eukaryotic. This means that 
they may belong to single-celled or multicellular organisms, they do have a 
nucleus and they are generally larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells.

Components of plant cells
Plant cells have many components in common with animal cells, 
including a nucleus in which the organism’s genetic material (DNA) 
is found. Plant cells also possess ribosomes for protein synthesis and 
mitochondria for respiration in their cytoplasm.
Plant cells possess some components not present in animal cells. 
Chloroplasts are small components, full of a green pigment called 
chlorophyll which is necessary for photosynthesis to occur. This reaction 
uses light energy from the Sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into 
glucose and oxygen and so provides an energy source for the plant. It is 
the green chlorophyll in plants that gives some of their parts their green 
colour. Most roots are hidden from the Sun and so cannot photosynthesise. 
They do not have chloroplasts and so are often white, not green.
There are huge numbers of chloroplasts in leaf cells. There are often 
well over half a million per square millimetre of leaf.
Plant cells also possess a cell wall, unlike animal cells. This is made 
from cellulose and provides structure for the cell. Plants would not be 
able to stand upright to catch light energy from the Sun without cell 
walls. The cell surface membrane is found inside the cell wall.

It's basically the opposite of a condensation reaction.3) For example, carbohydrates can be broken down into their constituent monosaccharides by hydrolysis reactions.PolymerAHydrolysis — the bond is broken by theaddition of a water molecule-OH HO--OHEven hydrolysis couldn't break this bond.Use the Benedict’s Test for SugarsSugar is a general term for monosaccharides and disaccharides. All sugars can be classified as reducing or non-reducing. The Benedict's test tests for sugars — it differs depending on the type of sugar you are testing for.1)2)3)Reducing sugars include all monosaccharides (e.g. glucose) and some disaccharides (e.g. maltose and lactose).You add Benedict's reagent (which is blue) to a sample and heat it in a water bath that's been brought to the boil.If the test's positive it will form a coloured precipitate (solid particles suspended in the solution).The colour of the precipitate changes from:blue-£> green>=>-yellowH>orange=4> brick redr Alwars us« an excess of r Z Benedict's solution — ;Z thls mak« sure that all ~ Z the sugar reacts. z1 1 1 "" I I I I I I M M | | | V\N4)The higher the concentration of reducing sugar, the further the colour change goes — you can use this to compare the amount of reducing sugar in different solutions. A more accurate way of doing this is to filter the solution and weigh the precipitate.C/1d£<UD1X1UZuDOLUIzO1) If the result of the reducing sugars test is negative, there could still be a non-reducing sugar present. To test for non-reducing sugars, like sucrose, first you have to break them down into monosaccharides.2) You do this by getting a new sample of the test solution, adding dilute hydrochloric acid and carefully heating it in a water bath that's been brought to the boil. You then neutralise it with sodium hydrogencarbonate. Then just carry out the Benedict's test as you would for a reducing sugar.3) If the test's positive it will form a coloured precipitate (as for the reducing sugars test). If the test's negative the solution will stay blue, which means it doesn't contain any sugar (either reducing or non-reducing).Topic 1A — Biological Molecules

a-glucose a-glucose a-glucose a-glucose a-glucoseYou need to know about the relationship between the structure and function of three polysaccharides— starch, glycogen and cellulose.Starch is the Main Energy Storage Material in Plants
one alpha-glucose molecule1) Cells get energy from glucose. Plants store excess glucose as starch (when a plant needs more glucose for energy, it breaks down starch to release the glucose).2) Starch is a mixture of two polysaccharides of alpha-glucose — amylose and amylopectin:• Amylose — a long, unbranched chain of a-glucose. The angles of the glycosidic bonds give it a coiled structure, almost like a cylinder. This makes it compact, so it's really good for storage because you can fit more in to a small space.• Amylopectin — a long, branched chain of a-glucose. Its side branches allow the enzymes that break down the molecule to get at the glycosidic bonds easily.This means that the glucose can be released quickly. Amylopectin3) Starch is insoluble in water and doesn't affect water potential (see page 40), so it doesn't cause water to enter cells by osmosis, which would make them swell.This makes it good for storage.Use the Iodine Test for StarchIf you do any experiment on the digestion of starch and want to find out if any is left, you'll need the iodine test.just add iodine dissolved in potassium iodide solution to the test sample. If there is starch present, the sample changes from browny-orange to a dark, blue-black colour.Glycogen is the Main Energy Storage Material in AnimalsGlycogen1) Animal cells get energy from glucose too.But animals store excess glucose as glycogen— another polysaccharide of alpha-glucose.2) Its structure is very similar to amylopectin, except that it has loads more side branches coming off it. Loads of branches means that stored glucose can be released quickly, which is important for energy release in animals.3) It's also a very compact molecule, so it's good for storage.After throwing and fetching the ball no less than 312 times, Chappy and Stuart were finally out of glycogen.Topic 1A — Biological Molecules
","@@@INTRODUCTION TO BIOLOGICAL MOLECULES AND CARBOHYDRATES
The topic of IA focuses on Biological Molecules, emphasizing that all organisms, despite their differences, share some biochemical characteristics. These include various carbon-based compounds that behave in comparable manners. Part of this shared biochemistry involves carbohydrates, which, alongside proteins and nucleic acids, are generally polymers. Polymers are large, complex molecules made up of long chains of monomers, which are small, basic molecular units. Examples of monomers include monosaccharides (simple sugars like glucose, fructose, and galactose), amino acids, and nucleotides.

@@@STRUCTURE OF CARBOHYDRATES
Carbohydrates are composed of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O), and their fundamental building blocks are monosaccharides. Specifically, glucose is highlighted as a hexose sugar, meaning it contains six carbon atoms. Two structural variants of glucose, alpha-glucose and beta-glucose, are mentioned as isomers — compounds with the same formula but different structural arrangements. These two forms have a key structural difference that students need to recognize for their examinations.

@@@FORMATION OF DISACCHARIDES THROUGH CONDENSATION REACTIONS
Monosaccharides combine through condensation reactions, which result in the formation of new chemical bonds and the release of water molecules. Glycosidic bonds are the type of bonds that form between monosaccharides during this process. When two alpha-glucose molecules join, they create maltose, a disaccharide, through such a reaction. Examples of other disaccharides include sucrose, made from glucose and fructose, and lactose, made from glucose and galactose.

@@@BREAKDOWN OF POLYMERS VIA HYDROLYSIS REACTIONS
In contrast to the synthesis seen in condensation reactions, hydrolysis reactions involve the breakdown of polymers into monomers using water molecules. This process, essentially the reverse of condensation, is key to decomposing carbohydrates into their monosaccharide components.

@@@IDENTIFICATION OF SUGARS USING THE BENEDICT’S TEST
The Benedict's test is a method used to identify reducing sugars, which include monosaccharides and some disaccharides like maltose and lactose. The test involves adding a blue Benedict's reagent to the sample and then heating it. If reducing sugars are present, a color change in the solution will occur, ranging from green to brick red, depending on the concentration of the sugar. For non-reducing sugars, additional steps involving acid hydrolysis are required before performing the Benedict's test.

@@@POLYSACCHARIDES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS
After discussing monosaccharides and disaccharides, the focus shifts to polysaccharides, complex carbohydrates formed from more than two monosaccharides. Starch, a primary energy storage material in plants, is comprised of amylose and amylopectin — both polymers of alpha-glucose but with distinct structural properties. An iodine test can be used to identify the presence of starch. Animals store excess glucose as glycogen, a polysaccharide similar to amylopectin but with more extensive branching, allowing for a rapid release of glucose as needed for energy."

27Eukaryotic Cells and OrganellesThe Organelles in Specialised Cells Vary1) In multicellular eukaryotic organisms, cells become specialised to carry out specific functions.2) A cell's structure (i.e. its shape and the organelles it contains) helps it to carry out its function — so depending on what job it does, a specialised cell can look very different to the cells you saw on page 24.3) In the exam, you might get a question where you need to apply your knowledge of organelles to explain why a specialised cell is particularly suited to its function. You'll need to think about what organelles the cell needs to do its job — e.g. if the cell uses a lot of energy, it'll need lots of mitochondria. If it makes a lot of proteins it'll need a lot of ribosomes.Example:1)2)3)Epithelial cells in the small intestine are specialised to absorb food efficiently.The walls of the small intestine have lots of finger-like projections microvilli increasei • /• ft surface areacalled villi.

Epithelial tissue, muscular tissue and glandular tissue(which secretes chemicals) all work together to form the stomach — an organ. The stomach is part of the digestive system — this is an organ system made up of all the organs involved in the digestion and absorption of food (including the small intestine, large intestine and liver).Practice QuestionsQ1 What is a plant cell wall made of?

","@@@Overview of Eukaryotic Cells and Classification of Organisms
There are two types of cell — prokaryotic and eukaryotic. The next few pages are about eukaryotic cells and their organelles (all the tiny bits and bobs that you can only see in detail with a fancy microscope). Organisms can be Prokaryotes or Eukaryotes. Prokaryotic organisms are prokaryotic cells (i.e. they're single-celled organisms) and eukaryotic organisms are made up of eukaryotic cells. Both types of cells contain organelles. Organelles are parts of cells— each one has a specific function. Eukaryotic cells are complex and include all animal and plant cells, as well as all cells in algae and fungi. Prokaryotic cells are smaller and simpler, e.g. bacteria. See page 28 for more.

@@@Key Components and Structures Unique to Plant, Algal, and Fungal Cells
Eukaryotic cells are generally a bit more complicated than prokaryotic cells. Animal cells have a plasma (cell surface) membrane, rough endoplasmic reticulum, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasm, and mitochondrion. Plant cells have all the same organelles as animal cells, but with a few added extras: a cellulose cell wall with plasmodesmata ('channels' for exchanging substances with adjacent cells), a vacuole (compartment that contains cell sap), and of course good old chloroplasts. You might also see starch grains in plant cells, although they're not organelles. Plants use starch grains to store excess sugars. Algal cells are a lot like plant cells — they have all the same organelles, including a cell wall and chloroplasts. Fungal cells are also a lot like plant cells, but with two key differences: their cell walls are made of chitin, not cellulose, and they don't have chloroplasts (because they don't photosynthesise). Algae carry out Photosynthesis, like plants, but can be single-celled or multicellular. Fungi include mushrooms and yeast.

@@@Detailed Functions and Structures of Various Eukaryotic Organelles
Different Organelles have Different Functions. This giant table contains a big list of organelles — you need to know the structure and function of them all. Most organelles are surrounded by membranes, which sometimes causes confusion — don't make the mistake of thinking that a diagram of an organelle is a diagram of a whole cell. They're not cells — they're parts of cells. The Cell-surface (Plasma) Membrane regulates the movement of substances into and out of the cell. The nucleus controls the cell's activities (by controlling the transcription of DNA — see page 84). The mitochondrion is the site of aerobic respiration, where ATP is produced. In plant and algal cells, the chloroplast is where photosynthesis takes place. The Golgi apparatus processes and packages new lipids and proteins and makes lysosomes.

@@@Cell Specialization and Organization in Multicellular Organisms
The Organelles in Specialised Cells Vary. In multicellular eukaryotic organisms, cells become specialised to carry out specific functions. A cell's structure (i.e. its shape and the organelles it contains) helps it to carry out its function. Specialised cells are organised into tissues, organs, and organ systems. An example is epithelial cells in the small intestine which have lots of mitochondria — to provide energy for the transport of digested food molecules into the cell. Epithelial cells are grouped into epithelial tissue, and with muscular and glandular tissue, form the stomach as an organ, part of the digestive system, an organ system.

You can use microscopes to look at all the lovely organelles you've been learning about. 

@@@Magnification and Resolution in Microscopy
Magnification is Size, Resolution is Detail. We all know that microscopes produce a magnified image of a sample, but resolution is just as important.

@@@Types of Microscopes: Optical
There are Two Main Types of Microscope — Optical and Electron. Optical (light) microscopes use light to form an image. They have a maximum resolution of about 0.2 micrometres (µm). This means you can't use an optical microscope to view organelles smaller than 0.2 µm. That includes ribosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, and lysosomes. You may be able to make out mitochondria — but not in perfect detail. You can also see the nucleus. The maximum useful magnification of an optical microscope is about x 1500.

@@@Types of Microscopes: Electron
Electron microscopes use electrons to form an image. They have a higher resolution than optical microscopes so give a more detailed image (and can be used to look at more organelles). They have a maximum resolution of about 0.0002 micrometres (µm). (About 1000 times higher than optical microscopes.) The maximum useful magnification of an electron microscope is about x 1,500,000. A micrometre (µm) is three - orders of magnitude smaller than a millimetre (1 µm = 0.001 mm). To convert from µm to mm, divide by 1000. Technological advancements have led to the development of different types of electron microscopes.

@@@Electron Microscopes: Transmission and Scanning
Electron Microscopes are either Scanning or Transmission. Transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) use electromagnets to focus a beam of electrons, which is then transmitted through the specimen. Denser parts of the specimen absorb more electrons, which makes them look darker on the image you end up with. TEMs give high-resolution images, so you can see the internal structure of organelles like chloroplasts. However, they can only be used on thin specimens. Scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) scan a beam of electrons across the specimen. This knocks off electrons from the specimen, which are gathered in a cathode ray tube to form an image. The images show the surface of the specimen, and they can be 3-D. SEMs can be used on thick specimens but give lower resolution images than TEMs.

16,"31Analysis of Cell ComponentsCell Fractionation Separates OrganellesSuppose you wanted to look at some organelles under an electron microscope. First you'd need to separate them from the rest of the cell — you can do this by cell fractionation. There are three steps to this technique:(7) Homogenisation — Breaking Up the Cells jHomogenisation can be done in several different ways, e.g. by vibrating the cells or by grinding the cells up in a blender. This breaks up the plasma membrane and releases the organelles into solution. The solution must be kept ice-cold, to reduce the activity of enzymes that break down organelles. The solution should also be isotonic — this means it should have the same concentration of chemicals as the cells being broken down, to prevent damage to the organelles through osmosis. A buffer solution should be added to maintain the pH.(7) Filtration — Getting Rid of the Big Bits )Next, the homogenised cell solution is filtered through a gauze to separate any large cell debris or tissue debris, like connective tissue, from the organelles.The organelles are much smaller than the debris, so they pass through the gauze.(3) Ultracentrifugation — Separating the Organelles JAfter filtration, you're left with a solution containing a mixture of organelles. To separate a particular organelle from all the others you use ultracentrifugation.1) The cell fragments are poured into a tube. The tube is put into a centrifuge (a machine that separates material by spinning) and is spun at a low speed. The heaviest organelles, like nuclei, get flung to the bottom of the tube by the centrifuge. They form a thick sediment at the bottom— the pellet. The rest of the organelles stay suspended in the fluid above the sediment — the supernatant.2) The supernatant is drained off, poured into another tube, and spun in the centrifuge at a higher speed.Again, the heaviest organelles, this time the mitochondria, form a pellet at the bottom of the tube. The supernatant containing the rest of the organelles is drained off and spun in the centrifuge at an even higher speed.3) This process is repeated at higher and higher speeds, until all the organelles are separated out.

It needs to be the tip because that's where growth occurs (and so that's where mitosis takes place).If you're using ethano-orcein to stain the cells, the tips will also need to be fixed in ethanoic acid.Prepare a boiling tube containing 1 M hydrochloric acid and put it in a water bath at 60 °C. Transfer the root tip into the boiling tube and incubate for about 5 minutes.Use a pipette to rinse the root tip well with cold water. Leave the tip to dry on a paper towel.Place the root tip on a microscope slide and cut 2 mm from the very tip of it. Get rid of the rest.Use a mounted needle to break the tip open and spread the cells out thinly.Add a few drops of stain and leave it for a few minutes.The stain will make the chromosomes easier to see under a Telophase microscope. There are loads of different stains, all with crazy names (toluidine blue O, ethano-orcein, Feulgen stain...If you're using the beulgen stain, you'll need an extra rinse.Place a cover slip over the cells and push down firmly to squash the tissue. This will make the tissue thinner and allow light to pass through it. Don't smear the cover slip sideways (or you'll damage the chromosomes).Now you can look at all the stages of mitosis under an optical microscope (see below).

A plant root tip is constantly growing, so you'd expect a high mitotic index (i.e. lots of cells in mitosis). In other tissue samples, a high mitotic index could mean that tissue repair is taking place or that there is cancerous growth in the tissue.Topic 2 A — Cell Structure and Division

(3) Ultracentrifugation — Separating the Organelles - After filtration, you're left with a solution containing a mixture of organelles. To separate a particular organelle from all the others you use ultracentrifugation.

The process of ultracentrifugation involves the following steps: (1) The cell fragments are poured into a tube. The tube is put into a centrifuge and is spun at a low speed. The heaviest organelles, like nuclei, get flung to the bottom of the tube by the centrifuge. They form a thick sediment at the bottom — the pellet.

The supernatant containing the rest of the organelles is drained off and spun in the centrifuge at an even higher speed. (3) This process is repeated at higher and higher speeds, until all the organelles are separated out. Each time, the pellet at the bottom of the tube is made up of lighter and lighter organelles. Organelles are separated in the following order of mass (from heaviest to lightest): nuclei, mitochondria, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and finally ribosomes. There is also a humorous note relating to the experience of centrifugation and a visual depiction of an endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, lysosomes, mitochondria, and nuclei separated in the order of their mass. For clarity in experiments, if interested in observing mitochondria specifically, it's suggested to homogenise, filter, and ultracentrifuge first, and then decide whether to use a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) or Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), taking into account their limitations.

(3) Prepare a boiling tube with 1 M hydrochloric acid set in a water bath at 60°C, and incubate the root tip in it for about 5 minutes.
(4) Rinse the root tip well with cold water and leave it to dry.
(5) Place the tip on a microscope slide and cut 2 mm from the very tip. Discard the rest.
(6) Break the tip open and spread the cells thinly.
(7) Add a few drops of stain and leave it for a few minutes.
(8) If using Feulgen stain, an extra rinse is needed.
(9) Place a cover slip on top and squash the cells to thin the tissue enabling light passage.

Different stains are available, such as toluidine blue O, ethano-orcein, and Feulgen, each making chromosomes easier to see. Avoid smearing the cover slip to prevent damage. You can then observe cells in different stages of mitosis under an optical microscope.

You Can Observe Cells Using an Optical Microscope - Using an optical microscope involves the following steps:

(1) Clip the prepared slide onto the stage.
(2) Select the lowest-powered objective lens.
(3) Use the coarse adjustment knob to bring the stage close to the objective lens.
(4) Look down the eyepiece and adjust the stage position with the coarse knob to bring the image into rough focus.
(5) Use the fine adjustment knob for a clear image.
(6) For greater magnification, swap to a higher-powered lens and refocus.

It's important to note magnification and label drawings when recording mitotic cells. The Mitotic Index and its significance in determining tissue growth and abnormalities are discussed, with a formula provided for its calculation: mitotic index = (number of cells with visible chromosomes) / (total number of cells observed). A high mitotic index in plant root tips indicates active growth, whereas in other tissue samples, it may suggest tissue repair or cancerous growth."

Here's an example: 4.5 eyepiece divisions = 1 stage division. Line up the eyepiece graticule and the stage micrometer. Each division on the stage micrometer is 0.1 mm long. At this magnification, 1 division on the stage micrometer is the same as 4.5 divisions on the eyepiece graticule. To work out the size of 1 division on the eyepiece graticule, you need to divide 0.1 by 4.5: 1 division on eyepiece graticule = 0.1 / 4.5 = 0.022 mm So if you look at a cell under the microscope at this magnification and it’s 4 eyepiece divisions long, you know it measures: 4 x 0.022 = 0.088 mm. The eyepiece graticule will need to be re-calibrated at different magnifications. If you're given an image of cells under the microscope in the exam, you can calculate their actual size using this formula: Example: If the image of a cell measures 5 mm and the magnification is x 100, then the actual size of the cell will be: 5 / 100 = 0.05 mm. actual size = size of image / magnification

In eukaryotic cells,many of the organelles are surrounded by membranes too.1)2)Cell-surface membranes surround cells. They are a barrier between the cell and its environment, controlling which substances enter and leave the cell. They're partially permeable — they let some molecules through but not others. Substances can move across the cell-surface membrane by diffusion, osmosis or active transport (see pages 38-43).The membranes around organelles divide the cell into different compartments — they act as a barrier between the organelle and the cytoplasm. They are also partially permeable and control what substances enter and leave the organelle.Cell Membranes have a Fluid Mosaic’ StructurePartially permeable membranes can be useful at sea.The basic structure of all cell membranes is pretty much the same.

37Cell Membrane StructureThe Permeability of the Cell Membrane can be Investigated in the LabThe permeability of cell membranes is affected by different conditions, e.g. temperature and solvent concentration. You can investigate how these things affect permeability by doing an experiment using beetroot. Beetroot cells contain a coloured pigment that leaks out — the higher the permeability of the membrane, the more pigment leaks out of the cell. Here's how you could investigate how temperature affects beetroot membrane permeability:1) Use a scalpel to carefully cut five equal sized pieces of beetroot. (Make sure you do your cutting on a cutting board.) Rinse the pieces to remove any pigment released during cutting.2) Add the five pieces to five different test tubes, each containing 5 cm3 of water.Use a measuring cylinder or pipette to measure the water.3) Place each test tube in a water bath at a different temperature, e.g. 10 °C, 20 °C, 30 40 °C, 50 °C, for the same length of time (measured using a stopwatch).4) Remove the pieces of beetroot from the tubes, leaving just the coloured liquid.5) Now you need to use a colorimeter — a machine that passes light through the liquid and measures how much of that light is absorbed. The higher the absorbance, the more pigment released, so the higher the permeability of the membrane.6) You can connect the colorimeter to a computer and use software to collect the data and draw a graph of the results.°C,'ii 11 i 11 n ii 1111111,11111 ^- Colorimeters needr 5 minutes to stabilise before E- using and calibrating at zero -- by taking a measurement ~ ~ through pure water. —\ 11 i i ii n i ii j h 11 j n 111Increasing the Temperature Increases Membrane PermeabilityExperiments like the one above have shown that membrane permeability changes with temperature:(J) Temperatures below 0 °C — the phospholipids don't have much energy, so they can t move very much.

","@@@Introduction to Cell Membrane Structure
You might remember a bit about cell membranes from p. 25. Well now it's time to delve a little deeper into their structure and functionality. All cells are surrounded by cell membranes, and in eukaryotic cells, many of the organelles are also enclosed by membranes.

@@@Functions of the Cell Membrane
Cell-surface membranes serve as barriers between the cell and its external environment, controlling which substances can enter and leave the cell. They are selectively permeable, allowing some molecules to pass through by diffusion, osmosis, or active transport, while restricting others. Similarly, membranes around organelles segregate the cell into different compartments, maintaining a boundary between the organelle and the cytoplasm, and controlling substance exchange within the cell.

@@@Structure of Cell Membranes: The Fluid Mosaic Model
The basic structure of cell membranes, primarily composed of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates, is consistent across all cell types. The fluid mosaic model proposed in 1972 is a widely accepted description of the membrane's organization, where the phospholipid molecules form a double layer that is fluid due to constant movement amongst the molecules. Embedded within this bilayer are cholesterol molecules, various proteins—including channel and carrier proteins that facilitate transport, and receptor proteins for cell signaling—and glycoproteins which aid in cell recognition and interaction.

@@@Functional Roles of Membrane Components
Each component of the cell membrane serves a unique purpose. Phospholipids organize into a bilayer with hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails, forming a barrier to water-soluble substances. Cholesterol, another lipid component, contributes to membrane stability by fitting snugly between phospholipid molecules, making the membrane less fluid and more structured. This stability is especially critical in animal cells, which lack supporting cell walls.

@@@Investigating Membrane Permeability in the Laboratory
The permeability of cell membranes is influenced by environmental factors like temperature and solvent concentration. A laboratory method to examine this involves using beetroot pieces, where pigment leakage indicates membrane permeability. By varying the temperature or solvent exposure, one can monitor the color intensity in the solution to gauge the permeability changes.

@@@The Influence of Temperature on Membrane Permeability
Membrane permeability is temperature-dependent. Below 0 °C, phospholipids are closely packed, rendering the membrane rigid. However, this also leads to deformation of proteins within the membrane, increasing permeability. Between 0 and 45 °C, the membrane is semi-permeable, with increasing temperature causing phospholipids to move more, thereby increasing permeability. Above 45 °C, the bilayer begins to break down, pressure builds within the cell, and proteins deform, dramatically increasing membrane permeability.

@@@Examining the Fluid Mosaic Model
The fluid mosaic model is an interesting concept that describes the dynamic nature of cell membranes. This model is crucial because it explains the cell's capacity to alter shape and adapt without bursting due to rigidity. The membrane's fluidity is fundamental to the cell's mechanical stability and functionality."
19,"38Exchange Across Cell Membranes — DiffusionOoooh it's starting to get a bit more exciting... here's how some substances can get across cell membranes without using energy, just what you've always wanted to know, I bet.Diffusion is the Passive Movement of Particles1) Diffusion is the net movement of particles (molecules or ions) from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.2) Molecules will diffuse both ways, but the net movement will be to the area of lower concentration. This continues until particles are evenly distributed throughout the liquid or gas.3) The concentration gradient is the path from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Particles diffuse down a concentration gradient4) Diffusion is a passive process — no energy is needed for it to happen.5) Particles can diffuse across cell membranes, as long as they can move freely through the membrane.111' h 1 I I I  I  I IF! , M,,,, (/Polar molecules have Z ~ Partlal positive and negative ~ charges (see p. 20). I - Non-polar molecules don't r I i.i iji Hi h i/1111111111\E.g. oxygen and carbon dioxide can diffuse easily through cell membranes because they're small, so they can pass through spaces between the phospholipids. They're also non-polar, which makes them soluble in lipids, so they can dissolve in the hydrophobic bilayer.6) When molecules diffuse directly through a cell membrane, it's also known as simple diffusion.Facilitated Diffusion uses Carrier Proteins and Protein Channels1) Some larger molecules (e.g. amino acids, glucose) would diffuse extremely slowly through the phospholipid bilayer because they're so big.2) Charged particles, e.g. ions and polar molecules, would also diffuse slowly — that'sbecause they're water soluble, and the centre of the bilayer is hydrophobic (see page 36).3) So to speed things up, large or charged particles diffuse through carrier proteins or channel proteins in the membrane instead — this is called facilitated diffusion.4) Like diffusion, facilitated diffusion moves particles down a concentration gradient, from a higher to a lower concentration.5) It's also a passive process — it doesn't use energy.'fiAndy needed all his concentration for this particular gradient...Carrier proteins move large molecules across membranes, down their concentration gradient. Different carrier proteins facilitate the diffusion of different molecules.1) First, a large molecule attaches to a carrier protein in the membrane.2) Then, the protein changes shape.3) This releases the molecule on the opposite side of the membrane.high concentration of large moleculesbinding siteChannel proteins form pores in the membrane for charged particles to diffuse through (down their concentration gradient).

As diffusion takes place, the difference in concentration between the two sides of the membrane decreases until it reaches an equilibrium (i.e. the concentration on both sides is equal). This means that diffusion slows down over time.2) The thickness of the exchange surface — the thinner the exchange surface(i.e. the shorter the distance the particles have to travel), the faster the rate of diffusion.3) The surface area — the larger the surface area (e.g. of the cell-surface membrane),the faster the rate of diffusion.Microvilli increase the surface area for faster diffusionSome cells (e.g. epithelial cells in the small intestine) ha cell-surface membrane folding up on itself (see p. 27). human cells, microvilli can increase the surface area by that more particles can be exchanged in the same amouve microvilli — projections formed by the /licrovi 11 i give the cell a larger surface area — in about 600 times.

Facilitated diffusion depends on...1) The concentration gradient — the higher the concentration gradient, the faster the rate of facilitated diffusion (up to a point, see point 2 below). As equilibrium is reached, the rate of facilitated diffusion will level off.2) The number of channel or carrier proteins — once all the proteins in a membrane are in use, facilitated diffusion can't happen any faster, even if you increase the concentration gradient. So the greater the number of channel or carrier proteins in the cell membrane, the faster the rate of facilitated diffusion.Having more channel proteins increases the rate of facilitated diffusion _____________Aquaporins are special channel proteins that allow the facilitated diffusion of waterthrough cell membranes. Some kidney cells are adapted to have lots of aquaporins.The aquaporins allow the cells to reabsorb a lot of the water that would otherwisebe excreted by the body — about 180 litres need re-absorbing every day.In the exams, you might be asked to calculate the rate of diffusion (or any other form of transport across a membrane) from a graph.

","@@@Exchange Across Cell Membranes — Diffusion: Understanding the Passive Movement of Particles
Exchange Across Cell Membranes through Diffusion begins to unravel the seemingly complex process of how some substances cross cell membranes without expending energy—an excitement for those keen on cellular processes. A depth exploration of diffusion, the passive movement of particles, unfolds thusly:
1) Diffusion is the process where particles (molecules or ions) move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration naturally, aiming to reach an equilibrium.
2) Molecules move in both directions, but there is a net movement towards the area of lower concentration, which continues until an even distribution is achieved within the liquid or gas.
3) This movement path—from higher to lower concentration—is termed the concentration gradient. Movement along this gradient is known as traveling ""down"" the concentration gradient.
4) Diffusion is passive, requiring no energy to occur.
5) For particles to diffuse across cell membranes, they must freely traverse the membrane.

The ability of molecules to pass through the cell membrane depends on their characteristics. Polar molecules, with partial positive and negative charges, differ from non-polar molecules that do not carry the same charge distinctions. For example, molecules like oxygen and carbon dioxide can diffuse with ease through cell membranes because of their petite size, allowing passage between phospholipids, and their non-polar nature, enabling them to dissolve in the hydrophobic bilayer.

@@@Facilitated Diffusion: The Role of Carrier Proteins and Protein Channels in Membrane Transport
Sometimes, molecules require assistance to diffuse expeditiously across cell membranes. This section elucidates Facilitated Diffusion, the diffusion process for large or charged particles.
1) Large molecules, such as amino acids and glucose, would move sluggishly through the phospholipid bilayer due to their size.
2) Charged particles, including ions and polar molecules, would also diffuse at a slow pace given their water solubility and the bilayer's hydrophobic center.
3) Thus, to expedite the process, these larger or charged particles diffuse through carrier proteins or channel proteins present in the membrane, a process known as facilitated diffusion.
4) Facilitated diffusion, mirroring diffusion, moves particles down a concentration gradient without energy usage.

Carrier proteins work by attaching to a large molecule first, then altering their shape to release the molecule to the other side of the membrane, obeying the concentration gradient.

Channel proteins provide another facilitated diffusion pathway, creating pores in the membrane for charged particles to diffuse through, based on their concentration gradient, with each protein catering to different charged particles.

@@@The Rate of Diffusion: Factors Influencing Particle Movement Across Cell Membranes
This section examines the factors impacting the rate of diffusion, from concentration gradients to membrane adaptions for rapid transport.
1) The concentration gradient significantly affects the rate of diffusion; the higher it is, the quicker diffusion occurs, though the rate decreases as equilibrium gets closer.
2) The exchange surface's thinness is also critical—the thinner it is, the more rapid the diffusion, as the distance traveled by the particles is reduced.
3) A larger surface area, such as that of the cell-surface membrane, provides a faster diffusion rate.

Microvilli, for example, increase the surface area available for diffusion, as seen in epithelial cells within the small intestine. These microvilli can substantially increase a cell's surface area, thus boosting the diffusion rate.

To distinguish, simple diffusion relies on the concentration gradient, while facilitated diffusion not only relies on it but also on the availability and quantity of channel or carrier proteins present. The presence of more proteins equates to a faster facilitated diffusion rate. Special channel proteins like aquaporins illustrate the function by enabling water to diffuse through cell membranes efficiently.

Testing knowledge on diffusion can appear in exams where one might be asked to calculate diffusion rates from graphs, which could involve finding a line's gradient or drawing tangents.

@@@Practice and Exam Questions on Diffusion and Rate Factors
Finally, to solidify understanding, a set of practice questions challenges the learner's comprehension of passive diffusion and the role of microvilli. Additionally, an exam question calls for detailed knowledge involving facilitated diffusion of chloride ions, including the molecules involved, why simple diffusion is inefficient, and the implications over time. Through these inquiries, students get to delve deeper into the workings of molecules that endlessly move without growing weary, painting a picture of cellular functionality where small molecules like oxygen resort to simple diffusion, and large or charged molecules get a boost from channel or carrier proteins. All the while, this sets the stage for the upcoming topic of active transport."

","@@@Understanding Osmosis: The Diffusion of Water Molecules Across Cell Membranes
These two pages are entirely about the movement of water molecules. If you've mastered diffusion (see pages 38-39), you'll nail this lot in no time. Osmosis is Diffusion of Water Molecules. Osmosis is the diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane, from an area of higher water potential (i.e., higher concentration of water molecules) to an area of lower water potential (i.e., lower concentration of water molecules). Water potential is the potential (likelihood) of water molecules to diffuse out of or into a solution. Pure water has the highest water potential. All solutions have a lower water potential than pure water. If two solutions have the same water potential, they're said to be isotonic. LOWER water potential net movement of water molecules. OUT. IN Higher water potential water molecules diffuse both ways membrane. Water molecule. The Rate of Osmosis Depends on Several Factors. The factors affecting the rate of osmosis are similar to those affecting the rate of diffusion (see previous page). 

1) The water potential gradient — the higher the water potential gradient, the faster the rate of osmosis. As osmosis takes place, the difference in water potential on either side of the membrane decreases, so the rate of osmosis levels off over time.

2) The thickness of the exchange surface — the thinner the exchange surface, the faster the rate of osmosis.

First though, you need to make up several solutions of different, known concentrations to test the cylinders in. You can do this using a serial dilution technique: 

This is how you'd make five serial dilutions of a sucrose solution, starting with an initial sucrose concentration of 2 M and diluting each solution by a factor of 2... Line up five test tubes in a rack. You don't have to dilute solutions by a factor of 2. For example, to dilute by a factor of 10, take 1 cm3 from your original sample and add it to 9 cm3 of water. Transfer 5 cm3. Add 10 cm3 of the initial 2 M sucrose solution to the first test tube and 5 cm3 of distilled water to the other four test tubes. Then, using a pipette, draw 5 cm3 of the solution from the first test tube, add it to the distilled water in the second test tube and mix the solution thoroughly. You now have 10 cm3 of solution that's half as concentrated as the solution in the first test tube (it's 1 M). Repeat this process three more times to create solutions of 0.5 M, 0.25 M, and 0.125 M. 

@@@Advanced Techniques in Osmosis: Using Scale Factors to Prepare Solutions
You Can Also Make Solutions of Different Concentrations By Finding the Scale Factor. You can make sucrose solutions of any concentration by finding the scale factor. For example, if you want to make 15 cm3 of 0.4 M sucrose solution...

1) Start with a solution of a known concentration, e.g. 1 M. 

2) Find the scale factor by dividing the concentration of this solution by the concentration of the solution you want to make. So in this case, the scale factor = 1 M / 0.4 M = 2.5. 

3) This means that the solution you want to make is 2.5 times weaker than the one you have. To make the solution 2.5 times weaker, use 2.5 times less of it, i.e., 15 cm3 / 2.5 = 6 cm3. Transfer this amount to a clean test tube. 

4) Top up the test tube with distilled water to get the volume you want to make. In this case, you want to make 15 cm3 of solution, so you need to add: 15 - 6 = 9 cm3 of distilled water.

@@@Determining Water Potential in Potatoes Through Osmotic Experiments
Use Your Solutions To Find the Water Potential of Potato Cells. 

1) Use a cork borer to cut potatoes into identically sized chips, about 1 cm in diameter. 

2) Divide the chips into groups of three and measure the mass of each group using a mass balance. 

3) Place one group into each of your sucrose solutions. 

4) Leave the chips in the solutions for at least 20 minutes (making sure that they all get the same amount of time). 

5) Remove the chips and pat dry gently with a paper towel. 

6) Weigh each group again and record your results. 

7) Calculate the % change in mass for each group. 

8) Use the results to make a calibration curve, showing % change in mass against sucrose concentration. The potato chips will gain water (and therefore mass) in solutions with a higher water potential than the chips, and lose water in solutions with a lower water potential. The point at which the curve crosses the x-axis (where the % change in mass is 0) is the point at which the water potential of the sucrose solution is the same as the water potential of the potato cells. Find the concentration at this point, then look up the water potential for that concentration of sucrose solution in, e.g., a textbook.

The energy of these collisions also increases, which means each collision is more likely to result in a reaction. But, if the temperature gets too high, the reaction stops.1) The rise in temperature makes the enzyme's molecules vibrate more.2) If the temperature goes above a certain level, this vibration breaks some of the bonds that hold the enzyme in shape.3) The active site changes shape and the enzyme and substrate no longer fit together.4) At this point, the enzyme is denatured— it no longer functions as a catalyst.optimum temperature11 nn 11,TemperaturepH Also Affects Enzyme ActivityO’"" "" I M I | | | ,, , ,~ Every enzyme has an enzyme is r optimum temperature = denatured r For most human enzymes - r ,t,saro^37°C but some r _ enzymes, like those used in ~- biological washing powders, ~ ~ can work well at 60 °C ~All enzymes have an optimum pH value.

4) At this point, the enzyme is denatured— it no longer functions as a catalyst.

@@@pH Influence on Enzyme Activity
pH Also Affects Enzyme Activity. Every enzyme has an optimum temperature. For most human enzymes, it's around 37°C but some enzymes, like those used in biological washing powders, can work well at 60 °C. All enzymes have an optimum pH value. Most human enzymes work best at pH 7 (neutral), but there are exceptions. Pepsin, for example, works best at acidic pH 2, which is useful because it's found in the stomach. Above and below the optimum pH, the H+ and OH- ions found in acids and alkalis can mess up the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds that hold the enzyme's tertiary structure in place. This makes the active site change shape, so the enzyme is denatured.

@@@Effect of Enzyme Concentration on Reaction Rate
Enzyme Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction. 
1) The more enzyme molecules there are in a solution, the more likely a substrate molecule is to collide with one and form an enzyme-substrate complex. So increasing the concentration of the enzyme increases the rate of reaction. 
2) But, if the amount of substrate is limited, there comes a point when there's more than enough enzyme molecules to deal with all the available substrate, so adding more enzyme has no further effect.

@@@Impact of Substrate Concentration on The Rate of Reaction
Substrate Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction Up to a Point. 
1) The higher the substrate concentration, the faster the reaction—more substrate molecules means a collision between substrate and enzyme is more likely and so more active sites will be used. This is only true up until a 'saturation' point though. After that, there are so many substrate molecules that the enzymes have about as much as they can cope with (all the active sites are full), and adding more makes no difference. 
2) Substrate concentration decreases with time during a reaction (unless more substrate is added to the reaction mixture), so if no other variables are changed, the rate of reaction will decrease over time too. This makes the initial rate of reaction (the reaction rate at the start) the highest rate of reaction.

@@@Enzyme Inhibition Mechanisms
Enzyme Activity can be Inhibited. Enzyme activity can be prevented by enzyme inhibitors. Inhibition can be competitive or non-competitive.

COMPETITIVE INHIBITION molecules that bind to the enzyme that they inhibit. 
1) Competitive inhibitor molecules have a similar shape to that of the substrate molecules. 
2) They compete with the substrate molecules to bind to the active site, but no reaction takes place. 
3) Instead they block the active site, so no substrate molecules can fit in it. 
4) How much the enzyme is inhibited depends on the relative concentrations of the inhibitor and the substrate. 
5) If there's a high concentration of the inhibitor, it'll take up nearly all the active sites and hardly any of the substrate wil get to the enzyme. 
6) But if there's a higher concentration of substrate, then the substrate's chances of getting to an active site before the inhibitor increase. So increasing the concentration of substrate will increase the rate of reaction (up to a point).

NON-COMPETITIVE INHIBITION 
1) Non-competitive inhibitor molecules bind to the enzyme away from its active site. 
2) This causes the active site to change shape so the substrate molecules can no longer bind to it. 
3) They don't 'compete' with the substrate molecules to bind to the active site because they are a different shape. 
4) Increasing the concentration of substrate won't make any difference to the reaction rate—enzyme activity will still be inhibited.

22,"44Topic 2C — Cells and the Immune SystemThe Immune SystemAn infectious disease is one that is caused by pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses and fungi. Infectious diseases can be really nasty, but luckily there's an army of cells in the body that helps lo protect us — the immune system.Foreign Antigens Trigger an Immune ResponseAntigens are molecules (usually proteins) that can generate an immune response when clctected by the body.They arc usually found on the surface of cells and are used by the immune system to identify: pathogens (organisms that cause disease), abnormal body cells (e.g. cancerous or pathogen-infected cells, which have abnormal antigens on their surface), toxins and cells from other individuals of the same species (e.g. organ transplants).There are four main stages in the immune response:(T) Phagocytes Engulf PathogensA phagocyte (e.g. a macrophage) is a type of white blood cell that carries out phagocytosis (engulfment of pathogens). They're found in the blood and in tissues and are the first cells to respond to an immune system trigger inside the body. Here's how they work:1) A phagocyte recognises the foreign antigens on a pathogen.2) The cytoplasm of the phagocyte moves round the pathogen, engulfing it.3) The pathogen is now contained in a phagocytic vacuole (a bubble) in the cytoplasm of the phagocyte.4) A lysosome (an organelle that contain enzymes called lysozymes) fuses with the phagocytic vacuole. The lysozymes break down the pathogen.5) The phagocyte then presents the pathogen's antigens — it sticks the antigens on its surface to activate other immune system cells.nucleuscytoplasmlysosomeantigens on surface ofphagocyte engulfs the pathogenlysosome fuses with phagocytic vacuole(2) Phagocytes Activate T-cellsA T-cell {also called a T-lymphocyte) is another type of white blood cell. It has receptor proteins on its surface that bind to complementary antigens presented to it by phagocytes. This activates the T-cell. Different types of T-cells respond in different ways. For example, helper T-cells {TH cells) release chemical signals that activate and stimulate phagocytes and cytotoxic T-cells (Tc cells), which kill abnormal and foreign cells B-cells, which secrete antibodies (see below).Th cells also activate(3) T-cells Activate B-cells, Which Divide into Plasma CellsB-cells (also called B-lymphocytes) are also a type of white blood cell. They're covered with antibodies — proteins that bind antigens to form an antigen-antibody complex. Each B-cell has a different shaped antibody on its membrane, so different ones bind to different shaped antigens.1) When the antibody on the surface of a B-cell meets a complementary shaped antigen, it binds to it.2) This, together with substances released from helper T-cells, activates the B-cell. This process is called clonal selection.3) The activated B-cell divides into plasma cells.(V) Plasma Cells Make More Antibodies to a Specific AntigenPlasma cells are identical to the B-cell (they're clones). They secrete loads of antibodies specific to the antigen. These are called monoclonal antibodies. They bind to the antigens on the surface of the pathogen to form lots of antigen-antibody complexes,An antibody has two binding sites, so can bind to two pathogens at the same time. This means that pathogens become clumped together — this is called agglutination. Phagocytes then bind to the antibodies and phagocytose many pathogens at once. This process leads to the destruction of pathogens carrying this antigen in the body.variableregions(orange)constan regions (blue)heavychainAntibodies are proteins — they're made up of chains of amino acids.The specificity of an antibody depends on its variable regions, which form the antigen binding sites. Each antibody has a variable region with a unique tertiary structure {due to different amino acid sequences) that's complementary to one specific antigen. All antibodies have the same constant regions.Topic 2C — Cells and the Immune System
45The Immune SystemThe Immune Response Can be Split into Cellular and HumoralJust to add to your fun, the immune response is split into two — the cellular response and the humoral response.1) Cellular — The T-cells and other immune system cells that they interact with, e.g. phagocytes, form the cellular response.2) Humoral — B-cells, clonal selection and the production of monoclonal antibodies form the humoral response.Both types of response are needed to remove a pathogen from the body and the responses interact with each other, e.g. T-cells help to activate B-cells, and antibodies coat pathogens making it easier for phagocytes to engulf them.The Immune Response for Antigens can be MemorisedThe Primary Immune ResponseNeil's primary response — to his parents.1) When an antigen enters the body for the first time it activates the immune system. This is called the primary response.2) The primary response is slow because there aren't many B-cells that can make the antibody needed to bind to it.3) Eventually the body will produce enough of the right antibody to overcome the infection. Meanwhile the infected person will show symptoms of the disease.4) After being exposed to an antigen, both T- and B-cells produce memory cells. These memory cells remain in the body for a long time. Memory T-cells remember the specific antigen and will recognise it a second time round. Memory B-cells record the specific antibodies needed to bind the antigen.5) The person is now immune — their immune system has the ability to respond quickly to a second infection.The Secondary Immune Response1)2)3)If the same pathogen enters the body again,the immune system will produce a quicker, strongerimmune response — the secondary response.Clonal selection happens faster. Memory B-cells areactivated and divide into plasma cells that produce the right antibody to the antigen. Memory T-cells are activated and divide into the correct type of T-cells to kill the cell carrying the antigen.The secondary response often gets rid of the pathogen before you begin to show any symptoms (you are immune to the pathogen).Practice QuestionsQ1 What are antigens?Q2 What does the humoral response involve?

","@@@The Immune System Overview

An infectious disease is one that is caused by pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Infectious diseases can be really nasty, but luckily there's an army of cells in the body that helps to protect us — the immune system. 

@@@Foreign Antigens Trigger an Immune Response

Antigens are molecules (usually proteins) that can generate an immune response when detected by the body. They are usually found on the surface of cells and are used by the immune system to identify pathogens (organisms that cause disease), abnormal body cells (e.g., cancerous or pathogen-infected cells, which have abnormal antigens on their surface), toxins, and cells from other individuals of the same species (e.g., organ transplants).

@@@Phagocytes Engulf Pathogens as the First Stage of the Immune Response

There are four main stages in the immune response: The first stage of the immune response involves phagocytes, which are a type of white blood cell that carries out phagocytosis (engulfment of pathogens). They're found in the blood and in tissues and are the first cells to respond to an immune system trigger inside the body. The process includes the phagocyte recognizing foreign antigens on a pathogen, engulfing it, containing it in a phagocytic vacuole, and then a lysosome fusing with this vacuole to break down the pathogen using lysozymes. Afterward, the phagocyte presents the pathogen's antigens on its surface to activate other immune system cells.

@@@Phagocytes Activate T-cells as the Second Stage of the Immune Response

The next stage involves the activation of T-cells by phagocytes. A T-cell (also called a T-lymphocyte) with receptor proteins on its surface binds to complementary antigens presented by phagocytes. This activation of the T-cell leads to different responses by different types of T-cells, for example, helper T-cells (TH cells) release chemical signals that activate phagocytes and cytotoxic T-cells (Tc cells) which kill abnormal and foreign cells, as well as B-cells, which secrete antibodies.

@@@T-cells Activate B-cells, Leading to Clonal Selection

The third stage is the activation of B-cells by T-cells, which divide into plasma cells. B-cells (B-lymphocytes) are covered with antibodies that bind antigens to form an antigen-antibody complex. The antibody on the surface of a B-cell binds to a complementary shaped antigen, and with substances released from helper T-cells, the B-cell is activated in clonal selection and divided into plasma cells.

@@@Plasma Cells Produce Specific Antibodies as the Final Stage of the Immune Response

The fourth stage involves plasma cells, which are identical to the B-cell and secrete antibodies specific to the antigen. These antibodies can bind to pathogens resulting in agglutination where pathogens clump together, enabling phagocytes to phagocytose many pathogens at once. The destruction of pathogens carrying the antigen is thus facilitated in the body. Antibody specificity is based on the variable regions with unique tertiary structures complementary to specific antigens, and the constant regions are identical in all antibodies.

@@@The Immune Response Subdivisions and Memory Formation

The immune response is split into two subdivisions: the cellular response involving T-cells and other cells, and the humoral response involving B-cells, clonal selection, and monoclonal antibody production. Both types of response remove pathogens and interact with each other, as T-cells help to activate B-cells, and antibodies make it easier for phagocytes to engulf pathogens. Memory cells are produced following exposure to an antigen which allows the body to quickly respond to a second infection, producing a quicker and stronger response, which is known as the secondary immune response. Memory cells remain in the body for a long time, with memory T-cells remembering the antigen and memory B-cells recording the antibodies needed."
23,"46Immunity and VaccinesThe primary response gives us immunity against a disease, but only after you've become infected. If only there was a way to stimulate memory cell production without getting the disease... well, there is — vaccination.Vaccines can Protect Individuals and Populations Against Disease1) While your B-cells are busy dividing to build up their numbers to deal with a pathogen (i.e. the primary response — see previous page), you suffer from the disease. Vaccination can help avoid this.2) Vaccines contain antigens that cause your body to produce memory cells against a particular pathogen, without the pathogen causing disease. This means you become immune without getting any symptoms.3) Vaccines protect individuals that have them and, because they reduce the occurrence of the disease, those not vaccinated are also less likely to catch the disease (because there are fewer people to catch it from). This is called herd immunity.4) Vaccines always contain antigens — these may be free or attached to a dead or attenuated (weakened) pathogen.5) Vaccines may be injected or taken orally. The disadvantages of taking a vaccine orally are that it could be broken down by enzymes in the gut or the molecules of the vaccine may be too large to be absorbed into the blood.6) Sometimes booster vaccines are given later on (e.g. after several years) to make sure that memory cells are produced.Antigenic Variation Helps Some Pathogens Evade the Immune System1) Antigens on the surface of pathogens activate the primary response.2) When you're infected a second time with the same pathogen (which has the same antigens on its surface) they activate the secondary response and you don't get ill.3) However, some sneaky pathogens can change their surface antigens. This antigen variability is called antigenic variation. (Different antigens are formed due to changes in the genes of a pathogen.)4) This means that when you're infected for a second time, the memory cells produced from the first infection will not recognise the different antigens. So the immune system has to start from scratch and carry out a primary response against these new antigens.5) This primary response takes time to get rid of the infection, which is why you get ill again.6) Antigenic variation also makes it difficult to develop vaccines against some pathogens for the same reason. Examples of pathogens that show antigenic variation include HIV and the influenza virus.7) Here's how antigenic variation affects the production of vaccines to help prevent people catching influenza:1) The influenza (flu) vaccine changes every year. That's because the antigens on the surface of the influenza virus change regularly, forming new strains of the virus.2) Memory cells produced from vaccination with one strain of the flu will not recognise other strains with different antigens. The strains are immunologically distinct.3) Every year there are different strains of the influenza virus circulating in the population, so a different vaccine has to be made.4) New vaccines are developed and one is chosen every year that is the most effective against the recently circulating influenza viruses.5) Governments and health authorities then implement a programme of vaccination using the most suitable vaccine.1st infection

Topic 2C — Cells and the Immune System
47Immunity and VaccinesImmunity can be Active or PassiveACTIVE IMMUNITYThis is the type of immunity you get when your immune system makes its own antibodies after being stimulated by an antigen. There are two different types of active immunity:1) Natural — this is when you become immune after catching a disease.2) Artificial — this is when you become immune after you've been given a vaccination containing a harmless dose of antigen.PASSIVE IMMUNITYThis is the type of immunity you get from being given antibodies made by a different organism— your immune system doesn't produce any antibodies of its own. Again, there are two types:1) Natural — this is when a baby becomes immune due to the antibodies it receives from its mother, through the placenta and in breast milk.2) Artificial — this is when you become immune after being injected with antibodies from someone else. E.g. If you contract tetanus you can be injected with antibodies against the tetanus toxin, collected from blood donations.Active and Passive Immunity Have Contrasting CharacteristicsIn the exam you might be asked about the differences between these types of immunity:Active immunityPassive immunityRequires exposure to antigenDoesn't require exposure to antigenIt takes a while for protection to developProtection is immediateMemory cells are producedMemory cells aren't producedProtection is long-term because the antibody is produced (after activation of memory cells) in response to complementary antigen being present in the bodyProtection is short-term because the antibodies given are broken downPractice QuestionsQ1 How do vaccines cause immunity?Q2 Explain what antigenic variability is.Exam QuestionsQ1 Vaccines can be used to protect people against some diseases.

Explain why it is possible to suffer from the flu more than once.Q3 Immunity from a disease can be either active or passive.a) Explain why active immunity offers long-term protection against a disease, whereas passive immunity only offers protection in the short-term.b) It normally takes 14 days for immunity to develop after receiving a vaccine.Explain why vaccines do not usually offer immediate protection against a disease.An injection of dead bugs — roll on mv next vaccine...The influenza virus is so clever that it would almost make you think it had a mind of its own. I mean, as soon as we catch up with it and develop a vaccine, off it goes and changes its surface antigens again. Influenza virus: one, humans: nil. This is one of the ways viruses have evolved to avoid your immune system. Well, clever them.[3 marks] [4 marks][2 marks] [1 mark]
Topic 2C — Cells and the Immune System
","@@@Understanding Immunity and the Role of Vaccines

Immunity and vaccines play crucial roles in protecting individuals and populations from diseases. The primary response grants immunity against a disease but only after an infection has occurred. Vaccination provides a method to stimulate memory cell production without actually contracting the disease. Vaccines contain antigens that induce the body to produce memory cells against a pathogen without causing disease symptoms, resulting in immunity without sickness. Individuals who are vaccinated are protected, and herd immunity is established, decreasing the likelihood of disease spread, even to those who are not vaccinated. Vaccines may contain free antigens or ones attached to dead or weakened pathogens and can be administered through injection or oral intake. Booster vaccines may be required to ensure ongoing production of memory cells.

@@@The Challenge of Antigenic Variation in Pathogen Evasion

Not all pathogens are easily thwarted by the immune system. Antigenic variation occurs when pathogens alter their surface antigens, enabling them to evade the immune response even upon subsequent infections. This genetic change in pathogens such as HIV and influenza virus complicates vaccine development, as memory cells from a previous infection will not recognize newly altered antigens. The flu vaccine exemplifies this, as it must be updated annually to combat new strains of the virus that arise due to antigenic variation, with health authorities working to select and distribute the most effective vaccine each year. This dynamic challenge requires adaptive strategies to provide protection against evolving pathogens.

@@@Active and Passive Immunity: Types and Characteristics

Immunity can be categorized into active and passive forms. Active immunity, where the immune system produces its own antibodies in response to an antigen, can be natural, following an infection, or artificial, resulting from vaccination. Passive immunity involves the transfer of antibodies from another organism, and can also be natural, such as maternal antibodies, or artificial, through antibody injections like those used in response to tetanus. The differences between these types of immunity are significant. Active immunity leads to memory cell production and long-term protection, while passive immunity provides immediate but temporary protection without memory cell formation.

@@@Practical Understanding and Examination of Immunity Concepts

The study of immunity encompasses both practical understanding and theoretical knowledge, often assessed in exams. Students may encounter questions about the mechanics of vaccines, the concept of antigenic variability, and the distinctions between active and passive immunity. Exam questions might explore the effectiveness of vaccination programs, the recurring nature of diseases like influenza, and the timing and duration of immune protection afforded by different types of immunity. These questions help solidify understanding of immunological principles and their applications in medical science."

49Antibodies in MedicineThe ELISA Test is a Medical Diagnostic Test that Uses Antibodies1) The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) allows you to see if a patient has any antibodies to a certain antigen (see example below) or any antigen to a certain antibody.2) It can be used to test for pathogenic infections, for allergies (e.g. to nuts or lactose) and for just about anything you can make an antibody for.3) In an ELISA test, an antibody is used which has an enzyme attached to it. This enzyme can react with asubstrate to produce a coloured product. This causes the solution in the reaction vessel to change colour.4) If there's a colour change, it demonstrates that the antigen or antibody of interest is present in the sample being tested (e.g. blood plasma). In some types of ELISA, the quantity of this antigen/antibody can be worked out from the intensity of the colour change.5) There are several different types of ELISA. Direct ELISA uses a single antibody that is complementary to the antigen you're testing for. Indirect ELISA is different because it uses two different antibodies.This method is outlined below:EXAMPLE: Using an ELISA as a HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) TestAn indirect ELISA test can be used to see if a patient possesses antibodies to the HIV virus:0 HIV antigen is bound to the bottom of a well in a well plate (a plastic tray with loads of little circular pits in it).© A sample of the patient's blood plasma, which might contain several different antibodies, is added to the well.If there are any HIV-specific antibodies (i.e. antibodies against HIV) these will bind to the HIV antigen stuck to the bottom of the well.

Antibodies aren't only great for fighting off infection, they're also excellent tools for use in medical diagnosis and drug development. Let's all give three cheers for antibodies. Without them, we'd all probably be dead by now.

@@@ Monoclonal Antibodies: Precision Tools for Targeted Therapy
Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies produced from a single group of genetically identical B-cells (plasma cells). This means that they're all identical in structure. As you know, antibodies are very specific because their binding sites have a unique tertiary structure (see p.44) that only one particular antigen will fit into (one with a complementary shape). You can make monoclonal antibodies that bind to anything you want, e.g., a cell antigen or other substance, and they will only bind to (target) this molecule.

EXAMPLE: Targeting Drugs to Cancer Cells
1) Different cells in the body have different surface antigens.
2) Cancer cells have antigens called tumor markers that are not found on normal body cells.
3) Monoclonal antibodies can be made that will bind to the tumor markers.
4) You can also attach anti-cancer drugs to the antibodies.
5) When the antibodies come into contact with the cancer cells they will bind to the tumor markers.
6) This means the drug will only accumulate in the body where there are cancer cells.
7) So, the side effects of an antibody-based drug are lower than other drugs because they accumulate near specific cells.

EXAMPLE: Medical Diagnosis Through Pregnancy Testing
Pregnancy tests detect the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) that's found in the urine of pregnant women:
1) The application area contains antibodies for hCG bound to a colored bead (blue).
2) When urine is applied to the application area any hCG will bind to the antibody on the beads, forming an antigen-antibody complex.
3) The urine moves up the stick to the test strip, carrying any beads with it.
4) The test strip contains antibodies to hCG that are stuck in place (immobilized).
5) If there is hCG present the test strip turns blue because the immobilized antibody binds to any hCG — concentrating the hCG-antibody complex with the blue beads attached.
If no hCG is present, the beads will pass through the test area without binding to anything, and so it won't go blue.

@@@ The ELISA Test: A Versatile Method for Medical Diagnosis Using Antibodies
The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) allows you to see if a patient has any antibodies to a certain antigen (see example below) or any antigen to a certain antibody.

There are several different types of ELISA:
- Direct ELISA uses a single antibody that is complementary to the antigen you're testing for.
- Indirect ELISA uses two different antibodies. This method is outlined below:

EXAMPLE: Using an ELISA as an HIV Test
An indirect ELISA test can be used to see if a patient possesses antibodies to the HIV virus:
1) HIV antigen is bound to the bottom of a well in a well plate (a plastic tray with loads of little circular pits in it).
2) A sample of the patient's blood plasma, which might contain several different antibodies, is added to the well.
3) If there are any HIV-specific antibodies (i.e., antibodies against HIV), these will bind to the HIV antigen stuck to the bottom of the well.
4) The well is then washed out to remove any unbound antibodies.
5) A secondary antibody, that has a specific enzyme attached to it, is added to the well.
6) This secondary antibody can bind to the HIV-specific antibody (which is also called the primary antibody). 
7) The well is washed out again to remove any unbound secondary antibody. If there's no primary antibody in the sample, all of the secondary antibody will be washed away.
8) A solution is added to the well. This solution contains a substrate, which is able to react with the enzyme attached to the secondary antibody and produce a colored product.
9) If the solution changes color, it indicates that the patient has HIV-specific antibodies in their blood and is infected with HIV.

The washing steps are important to make sure unbound antibodies aren't left in the well, which could affect the results. For instance, unbound secondary antibodies could cause the test to appear positive when there are no HIV antibodies present. If the result was negative, there would be no color change because there would be no HIV-specific antibodies for the secondary antibody to bind to.

Lipids are really nice. Without them, we'd have no cell membranes. You owe it to them to make sure you can remember all of the stuff about them on these pages. It'll help you and your membranes get a good grade.

@@@Triglycerides and Their Structure
Triglycerides are a kind of lipid, having one molecule of glycerol with three fatty acids attached to it. Fatty acid molecules have long tails made of hydrocarbons. The tails are 'hydrophobic' (they repel water molecules), making lipids insoluble in water. All fatty acids have the same basic structure, with a carbon atom linking the fatty acid to the glycerol, an 'R' group which is the variable hydrocarbon tail, and the carboxyl group ('COOH') bonded to the rest of the molecule.

@@@Formation of Triglycerides Through Condensation Reactions
Triglycerides are formed through a process where fatty acids join to a glycerol molecule. When a fatty acid attaches to glycerol, an ester bond is formed, and a molecule of water is released—a condensation reaction. This process is repeated two more times to form a complete triglyceride, where each of the three fatty acids is linked to the glycerol backbone.

@@@Variations in Fatty Acids: Saturated vs. Unsaturated
Fatty acids can be classified as saturated or unsaturated, depending on the presence of double bonds within their hydrocarbon tails. Saturated fatty acids do not contain any double bonds between their carbon atoms, while unsaturated fatty acids have at least one double bond, causing the chain to kink.

@@@Phospholipids and Their Role in Cell Membranes
Phospholipids, which are the primary lipids found in cell membranes, share similarities with triglycerides. However, they have one significant difference: one of the fatty acid molecules in a phospholipid is replaced by a phosphate group. The phosphate group is hydrophilic (attracts water), contrasting with the hydrophobic nature (repel water) of the fatty acid tails. This dual nature is crucial for the structure and function of the cell membrane.

26,"52HIV and VirusesViruses aren't cells like bacteria. They're not even living things — they can only reproduce inside the cells of another organism (called the host). All viruses cause disease, and you need to know all about one particularly nasty blighter...HIV is the Virus That Causes AIDS1) HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that affects the immune system.It eventually leads to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).2) AIDS is a condition where the immune system deteriorates and eventually fails. This makes someone with AIDS more vulnerable to other infections, like pneumonia (see next page).3) HIV infects (and eventually kills) helperT-cells, which act as the host cells (see p. 28) for the virus. Remember, helper T-cells send chemical signals that activate phagocytes, cytotoxic T-cells and B-cells (see p. 44) so they're hugely important cells in the immune response. Without enough helper T-cells, the immune system is unable to mount an effective response to infections because other immune system cells don't behave how they should.4) People infected with HIV develop AIDS when the helper T-cell numbers in their body reach a critically low level.HIV has a Spherical StructureYou might get asked about the structure of HIV in your exam1) A core that contains the genetic material (RNA) and some proteins (including the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is needed for virus replication).2) An outer coating of protein called a capsid.3) An extra outer layer called an envelope. This is made of membrane stolen from the cell membrane of a previous host cell.4) Sticking out from the envelope are loads of copies of an attachment protein that help HIV attach to thehost helper T-cell.HIV Replicates Inside its Host’s Helper T-CellsHIV (and all other viruses) can only reproduce inside the cells of the organism it has infected. HIV replicates inside the helper T-cells of the host. It doesn't have the equipment (such as enzymes and ribosomes) to replicate on its own, so it uses those of the host cell.Here's how HIV replicates:1) The attachment protein attaches to a receptor molecule on the cell membrane of the host helper T-cell.2) The capsid is released into the cell, where it uncoats and releases the genetic material (RNA) into the cell's cytoplasm.3) Inside the cell, reverse transcriptase is used to make a complementary strand of DNA from the viral RNA template (see p. 16-17 for more on DNA and RNA).4) From this, double-stranded DNA is made and inserted into the human DNA.5) Host cell enzymes are used to make viral proteins from theviral DNA found within the human DNA.6) The viral proteins are assembled into new viruses, which bud from the cell and go on to infect other cells.During the initial infection period, HIV replicates rapidly and the infected person may experience severe flu-likesymptoms. After this period, HIV replication drops to a lower level. This is the latency period.

","@@@HIV and Viruses: Basic Concepts and Impact on the Immune System

Viruses aren't cells like bacteria. They're not even living things—they can only reproduce inside the cells of another organism (called the host). All viruses cause disease, and you need to know all about one particularly nasty blighter...HIV is the Virus That Causes AIDS. 1) HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that affects the immune system. It eventually leads to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). 2) AIDS is a condition where the immune system deteriorates and eventually fails. This makes someone with AIDS more vulnerable to other infections, like pneumonia (see next page). 3) HIV infects (and eventually kills) helper T-cells, which act as the host cells (see p. 28) for the virus. Remember, helper T-cells send chemical signals that activate phagocytes, cytotoxic T-cells and B-cells (see p. 44) so they're hugely important cells in the immune response. Without enough helper T-cells, the immune system is unable to mount an effective response to infections because other immune system cells don't behave how they should. 4) People infected with HIV develop AIDS when the helper T-cell numbers in their body reach a critically low level.

@@@The Structure of HIV

HIV has a Spherical Structure. You might get asked about the structure of HIV in your exam. 1) A core that contains the genetic material (RNA) and some proteins (including the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is needed for virus replication). 2) An outer coating of protein called a capsid. 3) An extra outer layer called an envelope. This is made of membrane stolen from the cell membrane of a previous host cell. 4) Sticking out from the envelope are loads of copies of an attachment protein that help HIV attach to the host helper T-cell.

@@@HIV Replication Process

HIV Replicates Inside its Host’s Helper T-Cells. HIV (and all other viruses) can only reproduce inside the cells of the organism it has infected. HIV replicates inside the helper T-cells of the host. It doesn't have the equipment (such as enzymes and ribosomes) to replicate on its own, so it uses those of the host cell. Here's how HIV replicates: 1) The attachment protein attaches to a receptor molecule on the cell membrane of the host helper T-cell. 2) The capsid is released into the cell, where it uncoats and releases the genetic material (RNA) into the cell's cytoplasm. 3) Inside the cell, reverse transcriptase is used to make a complementary strand of DNA from the viral RNA template (see p. 16-17 for more on DNA and RNA). 4) From this, double-stranded DNA is made and inserted into the human DNA. 5) Host cell enzymes are used to make viral proteins from the viral DNA found within the human DNA. 6) The viral proteins are assembled into new viruses, which bud from the cell and go on to infect other cells. During the initial infection period, HIV replicates rapidly and the infected person may experience severe flu-like symptoms. After this period, HIV replication drops to a lower level. This is the latency period. During the latency period (which can last for years), the infected person won't experience any symptoms.

@@@Clinical Progression and Illnesses Associated with AIDS

People with AIDS are Susceptible to a Range of Illnesses. People with HIV are classed as having AIDS when symptoms of their failing immune system start to appear or their helper T-cell count drops below a certain level. People with AIDS generally develop diseases that wouldn't cause serious problems in people with a healthy immune system. The length of time between infection with HIV and the development of AIDS varies between individuals but without treatment it's usually around 10 years. 1) The initial symptoms of AIDS include minor infections of mucous membranes (e.g. the inside of the nose, ears and genitals), and recurring respiratory infections. 2) As AIDS progresses the number of immune system cells decreases further. Patients become susceptible to more serious infections including chronic diarrhoea, severe bacterial infections and tuberculosis. 3) During the late stages of AIDS patients have a very low number of immune system cells and can develop a range of serious infections such as toxoplasmosis of the brain (a parasite infection) and candidiasis of the respiratory system (fungal infection). It's these serious infections that kill AIDS patients, not HIV itself. The length of time that people survive with AIDS varies a lot. Factors that affect progression of HIV to AIDS and survival time with AIDS include existing infections, the strain of HIV they're infected with, age and access to healthcare.

@@@Why Antibiotics Are Ineffective Against HIV and Treatment Strategies

Antibiotics Don’t Work Against Viruses. 1) Antibiotics kill bacteria by interfering with their metabolic reactions. They target the bacterial enzymes and ribosomes used in these reactions. 2) Bacterial enzymes and ribosomes are different from human enzymes and ribosomes. Antibiotics are designed to only target the bacterial ones so they don't damage human cells. Makes sense. 3) Viruses don't have their own enzymes and ribosomes—they use the ones in the host's cells. So because human viruses use human enzymes and ribosomes to replicate, antibiotics can't inhibit them because they don't target human processes. 4) Most antiviral drugs are designed to target the few virus-specific enzymes (enzymes that only the virus uses) that exist. For example, HIV uses reverse transcriptase to replicate (see previous page). Human cells don't use this enzyme so drugs can be designed to inhibit it without affecting the host cell. These drugs are called reverse-transcriptase inhibitors.

There’s No Cure for HIV. 1) There's currently no cure or vaccine for HIV but antiviral drugs can be used to slow down the progression of HIV infection and AIDS in an infected person. 2) The best way to control HIV infection in a population is by reducing its spread. HIV can be spread via unprotected sexual intercourse, through infected bodily fluids (e.g. like blood from sharing contaminated needles) and from a HIV-positive mother to her fetus. Not all babies from HIV-positive mothers are born infected with HIV and taking antiviral drugs during pregnancy can reduce the chance of the baby being HIV-positive.

Staying at the right temperature is difficult, and it's pretty heavily influenced by your size and shape...SizeThe rate of heat loss from an organism depends on its surface area. If an organism has a large volume, e.g. a hippo, its surface area is relatively small. This makes it harder for it to lose heat from its body.

","@@@Exchange and Transport Systems: Understanding the Importance of Size and Surface Area

Exchanging things with the environment is pretty easy if you're a single-celled organism, but if you're multicellular it all gets a bit more complicated... and it's all down to this 'surface area to volume ratio' malarkey. Every organism, whatever its size, needs to exchange things with its environment. Otherwise there'd be no such thing as poop scoops...

1) Cells need to take in oxygen (for aerobic respiration) and nutrients.
2) They also need to excrete waste products like carbon dioxide and urea.
3) Most organisms need to stay at roughly the same temperature, so heat needs to be exchanged too.

How easy the exchange of substances is depends on the organism's surface area to volume ratio.

@@@The Science Behind Surface Area to Volume Ratios in Different Animals

A mouse has a bigger surface area relative to its volume than a hippo. This can be hard to imagine, but you can prove it mathematically. Imagine these animals as cubes:

The hippo could be represented by a block measuring 2 cm x 4 cm x 4 cm. Its volume is 2 x 4 x 4 = 32 cm3. Its surface area is 2 x 4 x 4 = 32 cm2 (top and bottom surfaces of cube) + 4x2x4 = 32 cm2 (four sides of the cube). Total surface area = 64 cm2. So the hippo has a surface area: volume ratio of 64:32 or 2:1. Compare this to a cube mouse measuring 1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm. Its volume is 1 x 1 x 1 = 1 cm3. Its surfacc area is 6 x 1 x 1 = 6 cm2. So the mouse has a surface area: volume ratio of 6:1. The cube mouse's surface area is six times its volume, but the cube hippo's surface area is only twice its volume. Smaller animals have a bigger surface compared to their volume.

@@@Why Multicellular Organisms Rely on Exchange Organs and Mass Transport Systems

An organism needs to supply every one of its cells with substances like glucose and oxygen (for respiration). It also needs to remove waste products from every cell to avoid damaging itself.

1) In single-celled organisms, these substances can diffuse directly into (or out of) the cell across the cell-surface membrane. The diffusion rate is quick because of the small distances the substances have to travel.
2) In multicellular animals, diffusion across the outer membrane is too slow, for two reasons: Some cells are deep within the body — there's a big distance between them and the outside environment. Larger animals have a low surface area to volume ratio — it's difficult to exchange enough substances to supply a large volume of animal through a relatively small outer surface.

So rather than using straightforward diffusion to absorb and excrete substances, multicellular animals need specialised exchange organs (like lungs). They also need an efficient system to carry substances to and from their individual cells — this is mass transport. In mammals, 'mass transport' normally refers to the circulatory system, which uses blood to carry glucose and oxygen around the body. It also carries hormones, antibodies and waste like CO2. Mass transport in plants involves the transport of water and solutes in the xylem and phloem.

@@@How Body Size and Shape Influence Heat Exchange in Organisms

As well as creating waste products that need to be transported away, the metabolic activity inside cells creates heat. Staying at the right temperature is difficult, and it's pretty heavily influenced by your size and shape...

Size: The rate of heat loss from an organism depends on its surface area. If an organism has a large volume, e.g. a hippo, its surface area is relatively small. This makes it harder for it to lose heat from its body. If an organism is small, e.g. a mouse, its relative surface area is large, so heat is lost more easily. This means smaller organisms need a relatively high metabolic rate, in order to generate enough heat to stay warm.

Shape: 
1) Animals with a compact shape have a small surface area relative to their volume—minimising heat loss from their surface.
2) Animals with a less compact shape (those that are a bit gangly or have sticky outy bits) have a larger surface area relative to their volume—this increases heat loss from their surface.
3) Whether an animal is compact or not depends on the temperature of its environment. Here's an example:
- Arctic fox has small ears and a round head to reduce its SA:V ratio and heat loss.
- African bat-eared fox has large ears and a more pointed nose to increase its SA:V ratio and heat loss.
- European fox is intermediate between the two, matching the temperature of its environment.

@@@Adaptation Strategies of Organisms for Efficient Exchange

Not all organisms have a body size or shape to suit their climate—some have other adaptations instead...
1) Animals with a high SA:volume ratio tend to lose more water as it evaporates from their surface. Some small desert mammals have kidney structure adaptations so that they produce less urine to compensate.
2) To support their high metabolic rates, small mammals living in cold regions need to eat large amounts of high energy foods such as seeds and nuts.
3) Smaller mammals may have thick layers of fur or hibernate when the weather gets really cold.

","@@@Introduction to Gas Exchange in Humans
In humans, gas exchange takes place in the lungs. You need to know the structure of the lungs as well as how they're ventilated... take a deep breath... Lungs are Specialised Organs for Gas Exchange. Humans need to get oxygen into the blood (for respiration) and they need to get rid of carbon dioxide (made by respiring cells). This is where breathing (or ventilation as it's sometimes called) and the gas exchange system comes in.

@@@Human Gas Exchange System
Human Gas Exchange System includes intercostal muscles, bronchus, bronchiole, alveoli. The process starts when you breathe in, as air enters the trachea (windpipe). The trachea splits into two bronchi — one bronchus leading to each lung. Each bronchus then branches off into smaller tubes called bronchioles. The bronchioles end in small 'air sacs' called alveoli (this is where gases are exchanged — see next page). The ribcage, intercostal muscles, and diaphragm all work together to move air in and out. There are actually three layers of intercostal muscles. You need to know about two of them (the internal and external intercostal muscles) for your exam. We've only shown one layer here for simplicity.

@@@Ventilation: Breathing In and Out
Ventilation consists of inspiration (breathing in) and expiration (breathing out). It's controlled by the movements of the diaphragm, internal and external intercostal muscles, and ribcage. Inspiration involves the contraction of the external intercostal and diaphragm muscles, causing the ribcage to move upwards and outwards and the diaphragm to flatten, increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity. As the volume of the thoracic cavity increases, the lung pressure decreases (to below atmospheric pressure). Air will always flow from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure (i.e. down a pressure gradient) so air flows down the trachea and into the lungs. Inspiration is an active process — it requires energy. Expiration occurs when the muscles relax, causing the ribcage to move downwards and inwards and the diaphragm becomes curved again. This decreases the thoracic cavity's volume and increases air pressure, forcing air out of the lungs. Normal expiration is a passive process and doesn't require energy. During forced expiration, external intercostal muscles relax and internal intercostal muscles contract, pulling the ribcage further down and in. This antagonistic motion facilitates expiration.

@@@Gas Exchange in Alveoli
In Humans, gaseous exchange happens in the alveoli. Lungs contain millions of these microscopic air sacs where gas exchange occurs. The alveoli have a large surface area due to the huge number of them present in the lungs, which facilitates the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Each alveolus is made from a single layer of thin, flat cells called alveolar epithelium. Oxygenated blood is sent to the heart while deoxygenated blood arrives from the heart, facilitating the diffusion of O2 out of the alveoli into the blood and CO2 from the blood into the alveoli to be expelled. The Alveoli are anatomically designed to enable efficient gas exchange. Their structural features include a thin exchange surface and a large surface area, along with a steep concentration gradient of oxygen and carbon dioxide, which is continuously maintained by the flow of blood and ventilation.

@@@Practice and Exam Questions
There are questions for practice and examination.T he practice questions include: Describe the structure of the human gas exchange system, How is normal expiration different to forced expiration? Describe the movement of carbon dioxide and oxygen across the alveolar epithelium. While exam questions ask to describe two ways in which lungs are adapted for efficient gas exchange and describe the process of inspiration. Each question has a mark allocation indicating its significance or length of response expected. The context of these questions surrounds the adaptation of alveoli and their crucial role in gas exchange, reinforcing the material that needs to be mastered for a deeper understanding of human respiratory physiology.

@@@Lungs and Alveoli: Biological Interface with the Environment
A mammal's lungs act as an interface with the environment — they take in air and give out waste gases. Ventilation is the process that moves these gases into and out of the lungs, but the actual exchange of gases with the bloodstream is the responsibility of the alveoli. These well-adapted biological structures are essential for a mammal's respiratory system to function efficiently. The reference to pasta is likely a mnemonic device or a didactic metaphor to facilitate the memorization of the alveoli's function and form."
