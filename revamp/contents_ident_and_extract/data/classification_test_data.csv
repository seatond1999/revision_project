Summary of changes to assessment 
The table below provides an overview of the assessment in the previous 2008 
specification and the assessment in the 2015 specification. 
2008 specification 
2015 specification 
Unit 1 Historical Themes in Breadth

Two topics 
Two essays – one on each topic 
Paper 1 Breadth study with interpretations 
AO1 and AO3

Unit 2 British History Depth Studies 
AO1 and AO2a/b 
One topic 
Two source-based questions 
Paper 2 Depth study

AO1 and AO2b 
Paper 3 Themes in breadth with aspects in 
depth  
AO1 and AO2 
Unit 4 Historical Enquiry 
AO1 and AO2a 
Coursework 
AO1 and AO3 
 
AO1 is assessed in every examined paper: through breadth essays in Paper 1 (AS 
and A level), depth essays in Paper 2 (AS and A level), and depth and breadth 
essays in Paper 3 (A level). It is also assessed in the coursework.  
Source questions (AO2) appear in Paper 2 (AS and A level) and Paper 3 (A level). 
These target analysis and evaluation of primary/contemporary sources.  
Interpretations (AO3) are assessed in both the AS and the A level, as all three 
Assessment Objectives must be met in both qualifications. Paper 1 has an 
interpretations question for both AS and A level, and the A level coursework also 
targets AO3. 
Coursework forms 20% of the A level. It is designed to develop students’ skills in 
analysis and evaluation of interpretations of history. 
 
Assessment of sources and interpretations 
The approach to the assessment of sources and interpretations has been reviewed 
and amended following feedback from teachers and higher education and drawing 
on academic research. 
Research with teachers and higher education highlighted the following concerns: 
● 
Students do not always understand the distinction between primary source 
material and later interpretations, and tend not to engage with secondary 
sources as arguments. 
● 
Short source extracts are less likely to encourage sophisticated response than 
longer sources and extracts.

ABOUT THIS BOOK
Exam Practice 
Exam-style questions at the end of 
each chapter are tailored to the Pearson 
Edexcel specification to allow for practice 
and development of exam writing 
technique. They also allow for practice 
responding to the “command words” used 
in the exams (see the command words 
glossary at the back of this book).
The Preparing for your exams section 
at the end of the book includes sample 
answers for different question types, 
with comments about the strengths and 
weaknesses of the answers.
You should be able to put every 
stage of your learning in context, 
chapter by chapter.  
• Links to other areas of Physics 
include previous knowledge 
that is built on in the chapter, 
and areas of knowledge and 
application that you will cover 
later in your course. 
• Maths knowledge required is 
detailed in a handy checklist. If 
you need to practise the maths 
you need, you can use the 
Maths Skills reference at the 
back of the book as a starting 
point.
Thinking Bigger 
At the end of each topic, there 
is an opportunity to read and 
work with real-life research and 
writing about science. 
The activities help you to read 
authentic material that’s relevant 
to your course, analyse how 
scientists write, think critically 
and consider how different 
aspects of your learning piece 
together.
These Thinking Bigger activities 
focus on key transferable skills, 
which are an important basis for 
key academic qualities.

2. What’s changed? 
2.1 How have AS and A level changed? 
Changes to the AS and A level qualifications 
From September 2015, A level History will be a linear qualification. This means that 
all A level examinations must be sat – and coursework submitted – at the end of 
the two-year course. More information about the implications of the move to linear 
assessment is given on page 22. 
From September 2015, AS History will be a stand-alone qualification. This means 
that it cannot be used to contribute towards an A level History grade. More 
information about the relationship between AS and A level is given on page 19. 
Changes to History subject criteria 
The subject content requirements for AS and A level History were revised for 
specifications for first teaching 2015. All awarding organisations’ specifications for 
AS and A level History from 2015 must meet these criteria. The full subject content 
document can be found on the website of the Department for Education, but the 
boxes below highlight the key requirements. 
The following requirements apply to both AS and A level History specifications: 
Both AS and A level specifications must require students to study:  
● 
the history of more than one country or state, including at least one outside 
of the British Isles 
● 
aspects of the past in breadth (through period and/or theme) and in depth 
● 
significant individuals, societies, events, developments and issues within a 
broad historical context  
● 
developments affecting different groups within the societies studied 
● 
a range of appropriate historical perspectives, for example aesthetic, cultural, 
economic, ethnic, political, religious, scientific, social or technological.  
 
In addition, the following requirements also apply to A level specifications:  
A level History specifications must require students to study: 
● 
topics from a chronological range of at least 200 years  
● 
a substantial (a minimum of 20 per cent) and coherent element of British 
history and/or the history of England, Scotland, Ireland or Wales 
● 
change and/or development over a period of time sufficient to demonstrate 
understanding of the process of change, both long term (normally at least 
100 years) and short term.  
A level History specifications must also require students: 
● 
to develop an understanding of the nature and purpose of history as a 
discipline and how historians work 
● 
to carry out a historical enquiry that is independently researched. 
 
The main change in these revised criteria is the removal of the former requirement 
for students to study the history of more than one country/state or more than one 
period, and the addition instead of two new requirements: that all AS and A level 
students must study the history of more than one country or state, and that all A 
level students must study topics from a chronological range of 200 years.

GLOBAL ISSUES
7 FRAGILE ENVIRONMENTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE
CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
7.1 FRAGILE ENVIRONMENTS
The well-being of the Earth’s physical environments is of vital importance 
to us all. Our living standards and our health depend on the quality of those 
environments. However, natural environments are very fragile. There is a 
delicate balance between non-living parts (climate, rocks, soils) and living 
parts (plants, animals). Natural hazards, such as fires, high winds and volcanic 
eruptions, have always disturbed environments and made them more fragile 
(Figure 7.1). However, in most cases, they have recovered. For thousands of 
years, people have been making use of environmental resources to provide 
food, fuel and building materials. They have done so without causing too much 
environmental damage. Early people lived in harmony with the environment.
However, the growth of the world’s population today threatens to disturb 
the fragile balance of environments. People have disturbed 90 per cent of 
the Earth to some degree or another. It is hard to find areas of truly natural 
wilderness untouched by human activity.
The fragility of environments is closely related to the pressure that is put on 
them. The ecological footprint is a measure of the mark that humans make on 
the natural world. It considers how much land and sea are required to provide 
us with the water, energy and food we need to support our lifestyles. If the 
Earth’s resources were shared equally, it is believed that a ‘fair share’ for 
everyone would be a little less than 2 hectares of the globe. The UK has an 
ecological footprint of about 5.5 global hectares per person. This means  
that if everyone in the world consumed resources at the rate of people in  
the UK, we would need two more planets to sustain the world’s present 
population. Figure 7.2 shows how the ecological footprint varies around the 
world. It gives us an impression of where we might expect environments to  
be made fragile by people.

DID YOU KNOW?
Many environments are ‘fragile’ 
because of the delicate nature of most 
ecosystems. Look at Part 5.2 (page 
000) to help you to understand why.
In what ways do people threaten 
ecosystems?

Cambridge International AS and A Level Geography Revision Guide
1  Hydrology and fluvial geomorphology
l Evaporation and transpiration increase under warm, dry conditions and 
decreases under cold, calm conditions. Meteorological factors affecting 
evapotranspiration (EVT) include temperature, humidity and windspeed. 
Of these, temperature is the most important. Other factors include the 
amount of water available, vegetation cover and colour of the surface 
(albedo or reflectivity of the surface).
l EVT represents the most important aspect of water loss, accounting for 
the loss of nearly 100% of the annual precipitation in arid areas and 75% in 
humid areas.
l Potential evapotranspiration (PEVT) is the water loss that would occur if 
there was an unlimited supply of water in the soil for use by the vegetation. 
For example, the actual evapotranspiration rate in Egypt is less than 250 mm, 
because there is less than 250 mm of rain annually. However, given the high 
temperatures experienced in Egypt, if the rainfall was as high as 2000 mm, 
there would be sufficient heat to evaporate that water. Hence the potential 
evapotranspiration rate there is 2000 mm.
l The infiltration capacity is the maximum rate at which rain can be 
absorbed by a soil in a given condition. Infiltration is inversely related to 
runoff and is influenced by a variety of factors such as duration of rainfall, 
antecedent soil moisture (pre-existing levels of soil moisture), soil porosity, 
vegetation cover, raindrop size and slope angle.

l Soil moisture refers to the subsurface water in the soil. Field capacity 
refers to the amount of water held in the soil after excess water drains 
away, i.e. saturation or near saturation. Wilting points refer to the range 
of moisture content in which permanent wilting of different plants occurs. 
They define the approximate limits to plant growth. Throughflow refers 
to water flowing through the soil in natural pipes and percolines (lines of 
concentrated water flow between soil horizons).
l Groundwater refers to subsurface water. Groundwater accounts for 96.5% 
of all freshwater on the Earth. The permanently saturated zone within solid 
rocks and sediments is known as the phreatic zone. The upper layer of this is 
known as the water table. Baseflow refers to the part of a river’s discharge 
that is provided by groundwater seeping into the bed of a river. It is a 
relatively constant flow, although it increases slightly following a wet period.
l Recharge refers to the refilling of water in pores where the water has dried 
up or been extracted by human activity. Hence, in some places, where 
recharge is not taking place, groundwater is considered a non-renewable 
resource.
l Aquifers are rocks that contain significant quantities of water. A spring is a 
natural flow of water from the Earth’s surface. It occurs when the water table 
(the upper surface of saturation within permeable rocks) occurs at the 
surface. 
Evaporation refers to the 
transformation of liquid water from 
the Earth’s surface into a gas (water 
vapour).
Transpiration is water loss from 
vegetation to the atmosphere.
Evapotranspiration is the combined 
loss of water to the atmosphere 
through transpiration and evaporation.
Infiltration is the process by which 
water soaks into, or is absorbed by,  
the soil.
Runoff is water that flows over the 
land’s surface.
Typical mistake
Drainage basin hydrology is very 
variable from year to year. This can be 
due to natural changes or, increasingly, 
human-related activities.
Expert tip
You may be asked to draw a diagram of 
a drainage basin hydrological cycle. A 
systems diagram – with inputs, stores, 
flows and outputs – such as that in 
Figure 1.1, is much better than one 
that tries to show trees, clouds, rainfall, 
glaciers, rivers, lakes and oceans, for 
example.
Now test yourself
1 Define the following hydrological 
characteristics:
(a) interception
(b) evaporation
(c) infiltration
2 Study Figure 1.1.
Outline the differences between 
overland flow, throughflow and 
baseflow.
3 Suggest what is meant by 
interception storage in Figure 1.1.
4 Outline what may happen to water 
that is stored on the surface on the 
ground.
5 Comment on the influence of 
ground cover on infiltration rates 
(Table 1.1).

A  FURTHER KINETICS
Your health depends on a complex interplay of a large number of chemical reactions taking place in the cells of 
your body. In a healthy body, these reactions will take place at the correct rate, in the right place and at the 
right time. These reactions are controlled by enzymes. The branch of chemistry concerned with the rates of 
chemical reactions is called chemical kinetics. The term ‘kinetics’ implies motion and comes from the ancient 
Greek word for movement, kinesis. We can use the information obtained from the study of chemical kinetics to: 
 • understand the body’s metabolism (the chemical processes in the body)
 • model the effects of pollutants in the Earth’s atmosphere
 • develop new catalysts, which is of great importance to the chemical industry.
In Topic 9 (Book 1: IAS), we used a qualitative approach to the understanding of reaction rates. In this topic 
we will develop this further by adopting a quantitative approach. This will enable us to begin to understand 
what is happening during chemical reactions:
 • We know how atoms can bond together to form molecules, but why do the atoms change partners during 
chemical reactions? 
 • What exactly happens when a hydrogen molecule meets an iodine molecule and they subsequently react to 
produce hydrogen iodide?
It has been reported by scientists that the herb ginseng may be just as effective as Prozac at treating 
depression. Herbs and plant extracts have been used for centuries to cure diseases and to relieve pain. In 
many cases they are effective because they control the rates of chemical reactions within the body. In this 
topic we will study the rates of chemical reactions and the mechanisms by which they take place.
