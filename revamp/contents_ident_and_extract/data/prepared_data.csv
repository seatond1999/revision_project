Topic 4A Regenerating places
How and why do places vary?
'Place’ is quite a difficult idea – it’s about what makes an area tick, how it works, 
who lives there and how it has changed over time. A key factor of place is the local 
economy: its sectoral balance, the types of employment, and the local wages. 
The general ‘health’ of the local economy has a powerful influence on the broader 
quality of life experienced by people who live there. Local places also change their 
economies over time, impacting on place identity and their populations. Changes 
in functions are often the outcome of external factors, such as changing market 
conditions and competition, but they can also be instigated deliberately by planning 
– either at a local or national level.
You are required to study in-depth two contrasting places, focusing on: economic 
and social characteristics, changes over time, the connectivity and external 
linkages with other places, and how changes have impacted on the identity of your 
chosen places and their inhabitants. This necessitates research requiring lots of 
high-resolution local data sources such as census information, Index of Multiple 
Deprivation (IMD) data and even historical images! All sorts of local data might also 
be useful when it comes to your independent investigation as well.

From Pearson’s Expert Panel for World Class Qualifications 
May 2014 
“The reform of the qualifications system in England is a profoundly important 
change to the education system. Teachers need to know that the new qualifications 
will assist them in helping their learners make progress in their lives. 
When these changes were first proposed we were approached by Pearson to join an 
‘Expert Panel’ that would advise them on the development of the new qualifications. 
We were chosen, either because of our expertise in the UK education system, or 
because of our experience in reforming qualifications in other systems around the 
world as diverse as Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and a number of countries 
across Europe. 
We have guided Pearson through what we judge to be a rigorous qualification 
development process that has included: 
● 
extensive international comparability of subject content against the highest-
performing jurisdictions in the world 
● 
benchmarking assessments against UK and overseas providers to ensure that 
they are at the right level of demand 
● 
establishing External Subject Advisory Groups, drawing on independent subject-
specific expertise to challenge and validate our qualifications 
● 
subjecting the final qualifications to scrutiny against the DfE content and Ofqual 
accreditation criteria in advance of submission.  
Importantly, we have worked to ensure that the content and learning is future 
oriented. The design has been guided by what is called an ‘Efficacy Framework’, 
meaning learner outcomes have been at the heart of this development throughout.  
We understand that ultimately it is excellent teaching that is the key factor to a 
learner’s success in education. As a result of our work as a panel we are confident 
that we have supported the development of qualifications that are outstanding for 
their coherence, thoroughness and attention to detail and can be regarded as 
representing world-class best practice.”

Introduction 
The study of historical interpretations has been an important feature of the history 
curriculum for many years. The latest subject content requirements for Advanced 
Level History continue to stipulate its teaching. Pearson’s Edexcel GCE A level 
History (2015) assesses the study of historical interpretations through the 
coursework component of the qualification, as well as in Paper 1 Section C.  
Through the independently researched coursework assignment, students analyse, 
explain and evaluate the interpretations of three historians around a particular 
question, problem or issue, with the specification allowing a free choice of 
coursework topic and title. Students should understand the nature and purpose of 
the work of the historians as well as form their own critical view based on relevant 
reading on the question.  
By the end of the course students will:  
• 
recognise that interpretations are representations and constructions of the 
past  
• 
recognise the relationships between interpretations and the questions that 
they seek to ask and answer 
• 
comprehend and analyse the defining elements of particular interpretations  
• 
explain why historians arrive at the interpretations they do and understand 
that differences in interpretation can be legitimate  
• 
be able to evaluate differing interpretations against appropriate and 
relevant criteria  
• 
organise and communicate their findings. 
 
This guide draws on recent research and practitioner work on historical 
interpretations and aims to provide support for teachers in developing A level 
students’ understandings of historical interpretations by addressing the following 
questions:  
• 
What are historical interpretations? 
• 
What do we know about A level students’ thinking about historical 
interpretation?  
• 
How can we help A level students’ develop their thinking about historical 
interpretations?  
Note that this document offers guidance on teaching and learning approaches. For 
guidance on coursework requirements and marking criteria, please refer to the 
specification only.  
This is an abridged version of a fuller guide being prepared by Arthur Chapman, 
which will be available online in due course.

What are the challenges to understanding? 
This section addresses the following questions.  
• 
What does research tell us about the barriers to understanding that we are 
likely to encounter?  
• 
What do we know about how young peoples’ thinking can be progressed? 
Research on younger children’s thinking about historical 
interpretation 
Project CHATA explored 7-14 year-old students ideas about history and historical 
accounts or interpretations. From this research and data arising from the Schools 
Council History Project Evaluation (Shemilt, 1980), Lee and Shemilt developed a 
progression model for accounts, reporting a number of assumptions that students 
often hold about accounts, summarised in Table 1 below.   
 
Table 1: Progression in ideas about accounts: outline4 
1 
Accounts are just (given) stories 
2 
Accounts fail to be copies of a past we cannot witness 
3 
Accounts are accurate copies of the past, except for 
mistakes or gaps 
4 
Accounts may be distorted for ulterior motives 
5 
Accounts are organised from a personal viewpoint 
6 
Accounts must answer questions and fit criteria 
 
Before level 4 in this model students tend to understand historical accounts as 
(usually flawed) copies of a fixed past. At levels 4 and 5 students tend to 
understand accounts as either deliberately distorted or simply personal and 
subjective representations. It is only at level 6 in this model that students begin to 
engage with historical methodology in any sustained way: here we have a 
recognition that what historians say is shaped by the questions that they are trying 
to answer and / or by the concepts that they use to make sense of the past.

For Paper 3, the questions are synoptic. This means that 
questions will cover a number of different aspects of the 
issue so there will be some links to other parts of the 
core specification.
In all three exam papers, you will receive extra marks for 
correct spelling, punctuation, grammar and specialist 
terminology in your exam answers (SPaG). The marks 
for each question or part of a question will be shown 
in brackets: the number of marks should guide the 
allocation of your time.
You will be faced with answering different question 
types: multiple-choice, short answer, levels of response 
and extended prose. There will be some fairly demanding 
command terms in the exam questions that will require 
you to apply your knowledge and understanding.
You can practise your exam skills by using the Question 
Practice pages at the end of each section in this book, as 
well as the activities in each chapter.

1. Introduction 
Research and key principles 
The specification has been developed in consultation with the teaching community, 
higher education, learned societies and subject associations. Teachers from a range 
of schools and colleges – in focus groups, phone interviews and face-to-face 
conversations – have provided feedback at each stage and have helped us to shape 
the specification. History academics in UK universities have helped us understand 
how to build on the strengths of the 2008 A level specification and advised on how 
progression to undergraduate study could be improved.  
 
Drawing on feedback from all parts of the History education community, the 2015 
specification has been built on the following key principles: 
● 
A balance of coherence and choice. With the move from modular to linear 
qualifications, there is a greater focus on coherence within courses. The new 
specification combines Paper 1 breadth studies into routes with Paper 2 depth 
studies that are linked thematically, providing context and helping students to 
make connections. A greater choice is available in Paper 3 – allowing centres to 
select a topic within the same period as their Paper 1/2 route (provided there is 
an overall range of at least 200 years and British history is studied), or to select 
a different period.  
● 
Depth in context. Acknowledging stakeholder concerns about fragmented 
courses and about de-contextualised depth studies, the specification structure 
ensures more context is given to depth topics. This has been done through 
linking breadth and depth studies in thematic routes in Paper 1 and Paper 2, 
through placing historical interpretations within the breadth studies in Paper 1, 
and through placing aspects of depth alongside breadth themes in Paper 3, so 
that they are studied within a broader context. 
● 
Appropriate range and variety. Options are available from medieval, early 
modern and modern history, and from Britain, Europe and the wider world. In 
addition, more social and cultural history has been incorporated into topics so 
that there is a better balance with political history.  
● 
Centre choice of content for coursework. The structure of the specification 
– with routes through Paper 1 and Paper 2, and prohibited combinations with 
Paper 3 – ensures that all subject content requirements are met through the 
examined components. This gives centres the freedom to choose – or allow 
students to choose, with guidance – the content focus of the coursework.  
● 
Clearly distinguished breadth and depth. Breadth is now met in a single 
topic in Paper 1 rather than across two topics (as in the 2008 specification) and 
principles for breadth and depth have been applied to both the content and the 
assessment across components to ensure that each is targeted appropriately.  
● 
Improved approaches to assessing sources and interpretations. 
Contemporary sources and interpretations are assessed separately to help 
students see the distinction between them. Sources and interpretations extracts 
are slightly longer, but there are fewer of them. Questions require students to 
use the contents of the source(s), the information about the nature and origin 
of the source(s), and their own knowledge of the historical context, to 
encourage a better understanding of the nature of historical knowledge, 
historical evidence and historical methodology.  
● 
Clear mark schemes. The new mark schemes have strands that run through 
each level and are worded to reflect how teachers and examiners describe the 
qualities of student work, so that the expectations are clear for markers and for 
teachers.

Support for the new specification 
This Getting Started guide provides an overview of the new AS and A level 
specifications, to help you get to grips with the changes to content and assessment, 
and to help you understand what these mean for you and your students. 
 
We will be providing a package of support to help you plan and implement the new 
specification.  
● 
Planning: In addition to the Planning section in this guide, we will be providing 
a course planner outlining different delivery approaches, plus a scheme of work 
for every topic that you can adapt to suit your department.  
● 
Topic booklets: For each topic, an overview with contextual background, a 
student timeline, a list of useful resources for teachers and students and 
mapping to the 2008 specification (where relevant).  
● 
Example student work for each component with examiner commentaries. 
● 
Extra assessment materials for A level to use as a resource for mocks and 
practice. 
These support documents will be made available on the AS and A level 2015

2. What’s changed? 
2.1 How have AS and A level changed? 
Changes to the AS and A level qualifications 
From September 2015, A level History will be a linear qualification. This means that 
all A level examinations must be sat – and coursework submitted – at the end of 
the two-year course. More information about the implications of the move to linear 
assessment is given on page 22. 
From September 2015, AS History will be a stand-alone qualification. This means 
that it cannot be used to contribute towards an A level History grade. More 
information about the relationship between AS and A level is given on page 19. 
Changes to History subject criteria 
The subject content requirements for AS and A level History were revised for 
specifications for first teaching 2015. All awarding organisations’ specifications for 
AS and A level History from 2015 must meet these criteria. The full subject content 
document can be found on the website of the Department for Education, but the 
boxes below highlight the key requirements. 
The following requirements apply to both AS and A level History specifications: 
Both AS and A level specifications must require students to study:  
● 
the history of more than one country or state, including at least one outside 
of the British Isles 
● 
aspects of the past in breadth (through period and/or theme) and in depth 
● 
significant individuals, societies, events, developments and issues within a 
broad historical context  
● 
developments affecting different groups within the societies studied 
● 
a range of appropriate historical perspectives, for example aesthetic, cultural, 
economic, ethnic, political, religious, scientific, social or technological.  
 
In addition, the following requirements also apply to A level specifications:  
A level History specifications must require students to study: 
● 
topics from a chronological range of at least 200 years  
● 
a substantial (a minimum of 20 per cent) and coherent element of British 
history and/or the history of England, Scotland, Ireland or Wales 
● 
change and/or development over a period of time sufficient to demonstrate 
understanding of the process of change, both long term (normally at least 
100 years) and short term.  
A level History specifications must also require students: 
● 
to develop an understanding of the nature and purpose of history as a 
discipline and how historians work 
● 
to carry out a historical enquiry that is independently researched. 
 
The main change in these revised criteria is the removal of the former requirement 
for students to study the history of more than one country/state or more than one 
period, and the addition instead of two new requirements: that all AS and A level 
students must study the history of more than one country or state, and that all A 
level students must study topics from a chronological range of 200 years.

Changes to Assessment Objectives 
The AS and A level History Assessment Objectives have also been revised. There 
are now three objectives, with the former AO2a and AO2b split out into separate 
objectives. AO2 and AO3 both include ‘historical context’. Whereas in the past it 
was necessary to use AO1 to reward contextual knowledge used in analysing and 
evaluating sources and interpretations, contextual knowledge that it relevant and 
linked to analysis of source material will now be rewarded as part of AO2 and AO3. 
The weighting of AO1 has been reduced, and the weightings of AO2 and AO3 
increased to reflect this change. The same Assessment Objectives and weighting 
ranges apply to both AS and A level: all three Assessment Objectives must be 
assessed in the AS qualification and the A level qualification. 
AO1 
50–60% 
Demonstrate, organise and communicate knowledge and understanding to 
analyse and evaluate the key features related to the periods studied, 
making substantiated judgements and exploring concepts, as relevant, of 
cause, consequence, change, continuity, similarity, difference and 
significance 
AO2 
20–30% 
Analyse and evaluate appropriate source material, primary and/or 
contemporary to the period, within its historical context 
AO3 
20–30% 
Analyse and evaluate, in relation to the historical context, different ways 
in which aspects of the past have been interpreted

AO1 is assessed in every examined paper: through breadth essays in Paper 1 (AS 
and A level), depth essays in Paper 2 (AS and A level), and depth and breadth 
essays in Paper 3 (A level). It is also assessed in the coursework.  
Source questions (AO2) appear in Paper 2 (AS and A level) and Paper 3 (A level). 
These target analysis and evaluation of primary/contemporary sources.  
Interpretations (AO3) are assessed in both the AS and the A level, as all three 
Assessment Objectives must be met in both qualifications. Paper 1 has an 
interpretations question for both AS and A level, and the A level coursework also 
targets AO3. 
Coursework forms 20% of the A level. It is designed to develop students’ skills in 
analysis and evaluation of interpretations of history. 
 
Assessment of sources and interpretations 
The approach to the assessment of sources and interpretations has been reviewed 
and amended following feedback from teachers and higher education and drawing 
on academic research. 
Research with teachers and higher education highlighted the following concerns: 
● 
Students do not always understand the distinction between primary source 
material and later interpretations, and tend not to engage with secondary 
sources as arguments. 
● 
Short source extracts are less likely to encourage sophisticated response than 
longer sources and extracts.

2  Atmosphere and weather
Latitudinal variations in radiation
Atmospheric energy
The atmosphere is an open energy system receiving energy from both Sun and 
Earth. Although the latter is very small, it has an important local effect, as in the 
case of urban climates. Incoming solar radiation is referred to as insolation.
There are important variations in the receipt of solar radiation with latitude and 
season (Figure 2.3). The result is an imbalance: positive budget in the tropics, 
negative one at the poles. However, neither region is getting progressively hotter 
or colder. To achieve this balance the horizontal transfer of energy from the 
equator to the poles takes place by winds and ocean currents. This gives rise to 
an important second energy budget in the atmosphere – the horizontal transfer 
between low latitudes and high latitudes to compensate for differences in global 
insolation.

The variations of solar radiation with latitude and season for the 
whole globe, assuming no atmosphere. This assumption explains 
the abnormally high amounts of radiation received at the poles in 
summer, when daylight lasts for 24 hours each day.

Answers on p.00
Pressure variations
Sea-level pressure conditions show marked differences between the 
hemispheres. In the northern hemisphere there are greater seasonal contrasts 
whereas in the southern hemisphere more stable average conditions exist 
(Figure 2.4). The differences are largely related to unequal distribution of land 
and sea, because ocean areas are much more equable in terms of temperature 
and pressure variations.

Expert tip
Make sure when talking about summer 
and winter in the southern or northern 
hemisphere that you refer to months – 
it is easy to forget that if it is summer in 
one hemisphere it is winter in the other.

Paper 1 Core Geography
The drainage basin system 
A drainage basin is a natural system with inputs, flows and stores of water 
and sediment. Every drainage basin is unique, on account of its climate, geology, 
vegetation, soil types, size, shape and human activities. The drainage basin 
system is an open system as it allows the movement of energy and matter 
across its boundaries.
The hydrological cycle refers to the cycle of water between atmosphere, 
lithosphere and biosphere. Water can be stored at a number of stages or levels 
within the cycle (Figure 1.1). These stores include vegetation, surfaces, soil 
moisture, groundwater and water channels. Human modifications to these can 
be made at every scale.

Figure 1.1 The hydrological cycle
l Precipitation is the main input into the drainage basin system. The main 
characteristics that affect local hydrology include: the total amount of 
precipitation; intensity (mm/hour); type of precipitation (snow, rain etc.); 
geographical distribution; and temporal variability (i.e. seasonality).
l Interception has three main components: interception loss – water that 
is retained by plant surfaces and which is later evaporated away or absorbed 
by the plant; throughfall – water that either falls through gaps in the 
vegetation or which drops from leaves, twigs or stems; stemflow – water 
that trickles along twigs and branches and finally down the main trunk.
Revised
A drainage basin refers to the area 
drained by a river and its tributaries.
Hydrology is the study of water as it 
moves on, and under and through the 
Earth’s surface.
The water cycle or hydrological 
cycle is the movement of water 
between air, land and sea.
Precipitation is the conversion and 
transfer of moisture in the atmosphere 
to the land. It includes rainfall, snow, 
frost, hail and dew.
Interception is the precipitation that is 
collected and stored by vegetation.

1  Hydrology and fluvial geomorphology
l Evaporation and transpiration increase under warm, dry conditions and 
decreases under cold, calm conditions. Meteorological factors affecting 
evapotranspiration (EVT) include temperature, humidity and windspeed. 
Of these, temperature is the most important. Other factors include the 
amount of water available, vegetation cover and colour of the surface 
(albedo or reflectivity of the surface).
l EVT represents the most important aspect of water loss, accounting for 
the loss of nearly 100% of the annual precipitation in arid areas and 75% in 
humid areas.
l Potential evapotranspiration (PEVT) is the water loss that would occur if 
there was an unlimited supply of water in the soil for use by the vegetation. 
For example, the actual evapotranspiration rate in Egypt is less than 250 mm, 
because there is less than 250 mm of rain annually. However, given the high 
temperatures experienced in Egypt, if the rainfall was as high as 2000 mm, 
there would be sufficient heat to evaporate that water. Hence the potential 
evapotranspiration rate there is 2000 mm.
l The infiltration capacity is the maximum rate at which rain can be 
absorbed by a soil in a given condition. Infiltration is inversely related to 
runoff and is influenced by a variety of factors such as duration of rainfall, 
antecedent soil moisture (pre-existing levels of soil moisture), soil porosity, 
vegetation cover, raindrop size and slope angle.

l Soil moisture refers to the subsurface water in the soil. Field capacity 
refers to the amount of water held in the soil after excess water drains 
away, i.e. saturation or near saturation. Wilting points refer to the range 
of moisture content in which permanent wilting of different plants occurs. 
They define the approximate limits to plant growth. Throughflow refers 
to water flowing through the soil in natural pipes and percolines (lines of 
concentrated water flow between soil horizons).
l Groundwater refers to subsurface water. Groundwater accounts for 96.5% 
of all freshwater on the Earth. The permanently saturated zone within solid 
rocks and sediments is known as the phreatic zone. The upper layer of this is 
known as the water table. Baseflow refers to the part of a river’s discharge 
that is provided by groundwater seeping into the bed of a river. It is a 
relatively constant flow, although it increases slightly following a wet period.
l Recharge refers to the refilling of water in pores where the water has dried 
up or been extracted by human activity. Hence, in some places, where 
recharge is not taking place, groundwater is considered a non-renewable 
resource.
l Aquifers are rocks that contain significant quantities of water. A spring is a 
natural flow of water from the Earth’s surface. It occurs when the water table 
(the upper surface of saturation within permeable rocks) occurs at the 
surface. 
Evaporation refers to the 
transformation of liquid water from 
the Earth’s surface into a gas (water 
vapour).
Transpiration is water loss from 
vegetation to the atmosphere.
Evapotranspiration is the combined 
loss of water to the atmosphere 
through transpiration and evaporation.
Infiltration is the process by which 
water soaks into, or is absorbed by,  
the soil.
Runoff is water that flows over the 
land’s surface.
Typical mistake
Drainage basin hydrology is very 
variable from year to year. This can be 
due to natural changes or, increasingly, 
human-related activities.
Expert tip
You may be asked to draw a diagram of 
a drainage basin hydrological cycle. A 
systems diagram – with inputs, stores, 
flows and outputs – such as that in 
Figure 1.1, is much better than one 
that tries to show trees, clouds, rainfall, 
glaciers, rivers, lakes and oceans, for 
example.
Now test yourself

characteristics:
(a) interception
(b) evaporation
(c) infiltration

interception storage in Figure 1.1.
4 Outline what may happen to water 
that is stored on the surface on the 
ground.

Carbohydrates
Even though there is, and has been, a huge variety o f different organisms on Earth, they all share som e biochem istry
— for example, they all contain a few  carbon-based com pounds that interact in similar ways.
Most Carbohydrates are Polymers
1) 
Most carbohydrates (as w ell as proteins and nucleic acids) are polymers.
2) 
Polymers are large, complex molecules composed of long chains of 
' = 4
monomers joined together.
3) 
Monomers are small, basic m olecular units.
4) 
Examples of monomers include monosaccharides, amino acids and nucleotides.

monosaccharide,

polymer e.g. carbohydrate, protein
Carbohydrates are Made from Monosaccharides
1) 
All carbohydrates contain the elements C, H and O .
2) 
The monomers that they're made from are monosaccharides, e.g. glucose, fructose and galactose.
1) 
Glucose is a hexose sugar —  a m onosaccharide with six carbon atoms 
in each m olecule.
2) 
There are two types of glucose, alpha (a) and beta (|3)
— they're isomers (m olecules with the same m olecular formula as each 
other, but with the atoms connected in a different way).
3) 
You need to know the structures of both types of glucose for your exam
—  it's pretty easy because there's only one difference between the two:

Condensation Reactions Join Monosaccharides Together
1) 
A condensation reaction is when two m olecules join together with the formation of a new chemical bond,
and a water m olecule is released when the bond is formed.
2) 
M onosaccharides are joined together by condensation reactions.
3) 
A glycosidic bond forms between the two m onosaccharides as a m olecule of water is released.
4) 
A disaccharide is formed when two m onosaccharides join together.

m olecules are

to form maltose.

Carbohydrates
Hydrolysis Reactions Break Polymers Apart
1) 
Polymers can be broken down into monomers by hydrolysis reactions.
2) 
A hydrolysis reaction breaks the chemical bond between monomers using a water 
molecule. It's basically the opposite of a condensation reaction.
3) 
For exam ple, carbohydrates can be broken down into their constituent 
monosaccharides by hydrolysis reactions.

Hydrolysis —  the bond is broken by the
addition of a water molecule

Even hydrolysis couldn't 
break this bond.
Use the Benedict’s Test for Sugars
Sugar is a general term for monosaccharides and disaccharides. All sugars can be classified as reducing or 
non-reducing. The Benedict's test tests for sugars —  it differs depending on the type of sugar you are testing for.
1)
2 )
3)
Reducing sugars include all m onosaccharides (e.g. glucose) 
and some disaccharides (e.g. maltose and lactose).
You add Benedict's reagent (which is blue) to a sample 
and heat it in a water bath that's been brought to the boil.
If the test's positive it w ill form a coloured precipitate 
(solid particles suspended in the solution).
The colour of the precipitate changes from:
blue-£> green>=>-yellowH>orange=4> brick red

4)
The higher the concentration of reducing sugar, the further the 
colour change goes —  you can use this to com pare the amount 
of reducing sugar in different solutions. A more accurate way 
of doing this is to filter the solution and weigh the precipitate.

1) If the result of the reducing sugars test is negative, there could still be a 
non-reducing sugar present. To test for non-reducing sugars, like sucrose, 
first you have to break them down into monosaccharides.
2) You do this by getting a new sample of the test solution, adding dilute 
hydrochloric acid and carefully heating it in a water bath that's been 
brought to the boil. You then neutralise it with sodium hydrogencarbonate. 
Then just carry out the Benedict's test as you would for a reducing sugar.
3) If the test's positive it w ill form a coloured precipitate (as for the reducing 
sugars test). If the test's negative the solution w ill stay blue, which means it 
doesn't contain any sugar (either reducing or non-reducing).

143,"International History 1871–1945
Cambridge International AS Level History is a new series of three books 
that offer complete and thorough coverage of Cambridge International  
AS Level History (syllabus code 9389). Each book is aimed at one of the 
AS History syllabuses issued by Cambridge International Examinations for 
first examination in 2014. These books may also prove useful for students 
following other A Level courses covering similar topics. Written in clear and 
accessible language, Cambridge International AS Level History – International 
History 1871–1945 enables students to gain the knowledge, understanding 
and skills to succeed in their AS Level course (and ultimately in further 
study and examination).
Syllabus and examination
Students wishing to take just the AS Level take two separate papers at the 
end of a one-year course. If they wish to take the full A Level there are 
two possible routes. The first is to take the two AS papers at the end of the 
first year and a further two A Level papers at the end of the following year.  
The second is to take the two AS papers as well as the two A Level papers 
at the end of a two-year course. For the full A Level, all four papers must be 
taken. The two AS papers are outlined below.
Paper 1 lasts for one hour and is based on The Search for International Peace 
and Security 1919–45. The paper will contain at least three different sources, 
and candidates will have to answer two questions on them. Students are not 
expected to have extensive historical knowledge to deal with these questions, 
but they are expected to be able to understand, evaluate and utilise the 
sources in their answers, and to have sound background knowledge of the 
period. In the first question (a) candidates are required to consider the sources 
and answer a question on one aspect of them. In the second question (b) 
candidates must use the sources and their own knowledge and understanding 
to address how far the sources support a given statement. Chapter 5 provides 
the appropriate level of historical knowledge to deal with Paper 1.
Paper 2 lasts for an hour and a half. This paper contains four questions, 
and candidates must answer two of them. Each question has two parts: 
part (a) requires a causal explanation; and part (b) requires consideration of 
significance and weighing of the relative importance of factors. A question 
on each of the four topics outlined in the Cambridge syllabus (for example, 
International Relations 1871–1918) will appear in every examination paper.

152,"TOPIC 11 KINETICS
A  FURTHER KINETICS
Your health depends on a complex interplay of a large number of chemical reactions taking place in the cells of 
your body. In a healthy body, these reactions will take place at the correct rate, in the right place and at the 
right time. These reactions are controlled by enzymes. The branch of chemistry concerned with the rates of 
chemical reactions is called chemical kinetics. The term ‘kinetics’ implies motion and comes from the ancient 
Greek word for movement, kinesis. We can use the information obtained from the study of chemical kinetics to: 
 • understand the body’s metabolism (the chemical processes in the body)
 • model the effects of pollutants in the Earth’s atmosphere
 • develop new catalysts, which is of great importance to the chemical industry.
In Topic 9 (Book 1: IAS), we used a qualitative approach to the understanding of reaction rates. In this topic 
we will develop this further by adopting a quantitative approach. This will enable us to begin to understand 
what is happening during chemical reactions:
 • We know how atoms can bond together to form molecules, but why do the atoms change partners during 
chemical reactions? 
 • What exactly happens when a hydrogen molecule meets an iodine molecule and they subsequently react to 
produce hydrogen iodide?
It has been reported by scientists that the herb ginseng may be just as effective as Prozac at treating 
depression. Herbs and plant extracts have been used for centuries to cure diseases and to relieve pain. In 
many cases they are effective because they control the rates of chemical reactions within the body. In this 
topic we will study the rates of chemical reactions and the mechanisms by which they take place.
MATHS SKILLS FOR THIS TOPIC
 • Recognise and make use of appropriate units in calculation
 • Recognise and use expressions in decimal and ordinary form
 • Use calculators to find and use power functions
 • Use an appropriate number of significant figures
 • Change the subject of an equation
 • Substitute numerical values into algebraic expressions using appropriate units for physical quantities
 • Solve algebraic expressions
 • Translate information between graphical, numerical and algebraic forms
 • Plot two variables from experimental or other data
 • Determine the slope and intercept of a linear graph
 • Calculate the rate of change for a graph showing a linear relationship
 • Draw and use the slope of a tangent to a curve as a measure of the rate of change

Topic 9 (Book 1: IAS)
 • The concept of activation energy
 • The Maxwell–Boltzmann model of distribution of 
molecular energies
 • The role of catalysts in increasing the rate of 
chemical reactions
 • Reaction profiles for both uncatalysed and catalysed 
reactions
What will I study later?
 •
How pharmaceutical companies invest heavily in 
research and development to design new medicines 
to treat a wide range of medical problems and 
illnesses
 • How biocatalysts based on natural enzymes allow 
some reactions to occur at lower temperatures and 
pressures than other catalysts
 • How scientists are developing superconductors 
(materials with no electrical resistance that offer 
enormous energy savings in electricity transmission) 
based on organic compounds rather than metals
What will I study in this topic?

 • Selection of an appropriate technique to follow the 
rate of a reaction
 • Initial rate and continuous rate techniques for 
following reactions

AND ORDERS OF REACTION
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
◼ Understand the terms: 
(i) rate equation, rate = k[A]m[B]n, where m and n are 0, 1 or 2 
(ii)  order with respect to a substance in a rate equation 
(iii) overall order of a reaction 
(iv) rate constant 
(v) rate-determining step.
RATE EQUATION
WHAT IS A RATE EQUATION?
The usual relationship between the rate of reaction and the concentration of a reactant is that the 
rate of reaction is directly proportional to the concentration. In other words, as the concentration is 
doubled, the rate of reaction doubles.
Unfortunately, this is not always the case. Sometimes the rate will double, but sometimes it will 
increase by a factor of four. In some cases, the rate of reaction does not increase at all, or it increases 
in an unexpected way.
Let us consider the simple relationship where the rate is directly proportional to the concentration of 
a reactant, say A. We can represent this by the expression:
rate ∝ [A]
or:
rate = k[A]
where k is the proportionality constant.
This is called the first order rate equation. The constant k is called the rate constant.
 • Every reaction has its own particular rate equation and its own rate constant.
 • Rate constants will only change their value with a change in temperature.
Other common rate equations with respect to an individual reactant are:
second order rate equation: 
rate = k[A]2
zero order rate equation: 
rate = k[A]0 or rate = k
Zero order reactions do not occur very often, and it might be difficult at this stage for you to imagine 
why they should occur at all. However, you will find out shortly why they can occur.
If two or more reactants are involved, then it is possible to have a third order rate equation:
third order rate equation: 
rate = k[A]2[B]
THE UNITS OF RATE CONSTANTS
Table A shows the units for rate constants, using mol dm−3 as the unit of concentration and seconds 
as the unit of time. You find the units by rearranging the rate equation.

SPECIFICATION
REFERENCE
CORE PRACTICAL XX: 
X
Practical work is central to the study of physics. The International Advanced Subsidiary / Advanced Level (IAS / IAL) 
specification includes 16 core practical activities that link theoretical knowledge and understanding to practical 
scenarios. By completing the core practical activities, you will learn to:
 
● follow and interpret experimental instructions, covering a range of laboratory exercises throughout the course, 
with minimal help from your teacher
 
● manipulate apparatus, carry out all common laboratory procedures and use data logging (where appropriate)
 
● work sensibly and safely in the laboratory, paying due regard to health and safety requirements
 
● gain accurate and consistent results in quantitative exercises, and make the most of the expected observations  
in qualitative exercises
By the end of this course, you should be able to use a variety of apparatus and techniques to:
 
● design and carry out both the core practical activities and your own investigations
 
● collect data that can be analysed
 
● use data to draw valid conclusions.
Your knowledge and understanding of practical skills and activities will be assessed in all examination papers.
 
● Papers 1 and 2 (IAS), and 4 and 5 (IAL) will include questions based on practical activities, including novel scenarios.
 
● Paper 3 (IAS) and Paper 6 (IAL) will test your ability to plan practical work, including risk management and selection 
of apparatus.
Assessment for the Practical Skills Papers 3 and 6 will focus on three main areas:
 
● Planning: You will be expected to plan an experiment set by Pearson (but you will not need to carry it out).
 
● Implementation and measurements: You will be given details of an experiment carried out by an inexperienced 
student, and asked to comment on the investigation.
 
● Processing results / Analysing: You will need to analyse a set of experimental results.
The areas for assessment are outlined in the tables on pages 4 and 5. You may wish to tick off each element as 
you gain confidence. You can also refer to the Student Practical Guide, and the Appendix 10 in the specification: 
Uncertainties and practical work. 
You will find answers and maths skills required for the practicals at the back of the book.

ABOUT THIS BOOK
Exam Practice 
Exam-style questions at the end of 
each chapter are tailored to the Pearson 
Edexcel specification to allow for practice 
and development of exam writing 
technique. They also allow for practice 
responding to the “command words” used 
in the exams (see the command words 
glossary at the back of this book).
The Preparing for your exams section 
at the end of the book includes sample 
answers for different question types, 
with comments about the strengths and 
weaknesses of the answers.
You should be able to put every 
stage of your learning in context, 
chapter by chapter.  
• Links to other areas of Physics 
include previous knowledge 
that is built on in the chapter, 
and areas of knowledge and 
application that you will cover 
later in your course. 
• Maths knowledge required is 
detailed in a handy checklist. If 
you need to practise the maths 
you need, you can use the 
Maths Skills reference at the 
back of the book as a starting 
point.
Thinking Bigger 
At the end of each topic, there 
is an opportunity to read and 
work with real-life research and 
writing about science. 
The activities help you to read 
authentic material that’s relevant 
to your course, analyse how 
scientists write, think critically 
and consider how different 
aspects of your learning piece 
together.
These Thinking Bigger activities 
focus on key transferable skills, 
which are an important basis for 
key academic qualities.

5A FURTHER MOMENTUM
CHAPTER
Acceleration can be considered as a change in momentum per unit mass. It can often be more exciting than 
basic calculations such as calculating the changing speed of a car. 
Curling is a game which originated in Scotland. It is now an established sport which is popular in Canada and 
Japan. The sport uses the ideas of conservation of momentum and elastic collisions. Players deliberately collide 
the stones to deflect their opponents’ stones, and to ensure their own stone finishes in a winning position. Also, 
the friction with the ice causes a change in momentum to slow the stone to a stop.
In this chapter, you will learn about the way forces can change the momentum of an object over time. The 
chapter will also cover how kinetic energy changes in different types of collisions, whilst momentum is 
conserved. All of this will be extended to events happening in two dimensions, so vector addition and the 
resolving of vectors will be revisited in order to make the necessary calculations.
MATHS SKILLS FOR THIS CHAPTER
 • Use of trigonometric functions (e.g. finding components of momentum vectors)
 • Use of Pythagoras’ theorem (e.g. finding velocity as a vector sum)
 • Changing the subject of an equation (e.g. rearranging the impulse equation) 
 • Substituting numerical values into algebraic equations (e.g. finding the velocity after a collision)
 • Visualising and representing 2D forms (e.g. drawing a 2D momentum diagram for a collision between meteors)

ABOUT THIS BOOK
This book is written for students following the Edexcel International GCSE (9–1) Biology specification and 
the Edexcel International GCSE (9–1) Science Double Award specification. You will need to study all of 
the content in this book for your Biology examinations. However, you will only need to study some of it if 
you are taking the Double Award specification. The book clearly indicates which content is in the Biology 
examinations and not in the Double Award specification. To complete the Double Award course you will also 
need to study the Physics and Chemistry parts of the course.
In each unit of this book, there are concise explanations and worked examples, plus numerous exercises 
that will help you build up confidence. The book also describes the methods for carrying out all of the 
required practicals.
The language throughout this textbook is graded for speakers of English as an additional language (EAL), 
with advanced Biology-specific terminology highlighted and defined in the glossary at the back of the book. 
A list of command words, also at the back of the book, will help you to learn the language you will need in 
your examination. 
You will also find that questions in this book have Progression icons and Skills tags. The Progression 
icons refer to Pearson's Progression scale. This scale – from 1 to 12 – tells you what level you have 
reached in your learning and will help you to see what you need to do to progress to the next level. 
Furthermore, Edexcel have developed a Skills grid showing the skills you will practise throughout your 
time on the course. The skills in the grid have been matched to questions in this book to help you see 
which skills you are developing. Both skills and Progression icons are not repeated where they are same 
in consecutive questions. You can find Pearson's Progression scale at www.pearsonglobalschools.com/
igscienceprogression along with guidelines on how to use it.

ORGANISMS AND LIFE 
PROCESSES
All living organisms are composed of microscopic units known as cells. These building blocks of 
life have a number of features in common, which allow them to grow, reproduce, and generate 
more organisms. In Chapter 1 we start by looking at the structure and function of cells, and the 
essential life processes that go on within them. Despite the fact that cells are similar in structure, 
there are many millions of different species of organisms. Chapter 2 looks at the diversity of living 
things and how we can classify them into groups on the basis of the features that they show.

7  FRAGILE  
ENVIRONMENTS AND 
CLIMATE CHANGE
This chapter is about processes and pressures that are making 
some environments increasingly ‘fragile’. Desertification of 
the semi-arid areas of the world is partly the outcome of 
population growth exceeding environmental carrying capacities. 
Deforestation of the tropical rainforest is the result of a large-
scale and unsustainable exploitation of its resources. Global 
warming and climate change are increasing the fragility of 
some environments. What, if anything, can be done by way 
of new technologies and different management strategies to 
reduce the fragility? What are the responsibilities of individuals, 
organisations and governments?
By the end of this chapter, you 
should know:
◼    The distributions and 
characteristics of fragile 
environments
◼    The causes of desertification  
and deforestation
◼    The causes of climate change
◼    The impacts of desertification
◼    The impacts of deforestation
◼    The negative effects of climate 
change
◼    How technology can help 
to reduce the threat of 
desertification
◼    The different approaches to the 
management of the tropical 
rainforest in a named region
◼    Different responses to global 
warming and climate change 
from individuals, organisations 
and governments

7 FRAGILE ENVIRONMENTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE
CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING
7.1 FRAGILE ENVIRONMENTS
The well-being of the Earth’s physical environments is of vital importance 
to us all. Our living standards and our health depend on the quality of those 
environments. However, natural environments are very fragile. There is a 
delicate balance between non-living parts (climate, rocks, soils) and living 
parts (plants, animals). Natural hazards, such as fires, high winds and volcanic 
eruptions, have always disturbed environments and made them more fragile 
(Figure 7.1). However, in most cases, they have recovered. For thousands of 
years, people have been making use of environmental resources to provide 
food, fuel and building materials. They have done so without causing too much 
environmental damage. Early people lived in harmony with the environment.
However, the growth of the world’s population today threatens to disturb 
the fragile balance of environments. People have disturbed 90 per cent of 
the Earth to some degree or another. It is hard to find areas of truly natural 
wilderness untouched by human activity.
The fragility of environments is closely related to the pressure that is put on 
them. The ecological footprint is a measure of the mark that humans make on 
the natural world. It considers how much land and sea are required to provide 
us with the water, energy and food we need to support our lifestyles. If the 
Earth’s resources were shared equally, it is believed that a ‘fair share’ for 
everyone would be a little less than 2 hectares of the globe. The UK has an 
ecological footprint of about 5.5 global hectares per person. This means  
that if everyone in the world consumed resources at the rate of people in  
the UK, we would need two more planets to sustain the world’s present 
population. Figure 7.2 shows how the ecological footprint varies around the 
world. It gives us an impression of where we might expect environments to  
be made fragile by people.

DID YOU KNOW?
Many environments are ‘fragile’ 
because of the delicate nature of most 
ecosystems. Look at Part 5.2 (page 
000) to help you to understand why.
In what ways do people threaten 
ecosystems?

Commercial logging/timber extraction 
(globally 26%)
only valuable trees are chopped down (selective 
logging) but as they fall, they damage other 
trees. Even more damage is caused by  
‘clear-felling’, where other trees are also 
chopped down and chipped for pulp.
Agriculture (globally 32%)
areas of tropical rain forest have been cleared 
for plantations growing a single crop such as 
rubber or cofee. Plants and grassland are 
grown, which huge herds of cattle graze on for 
a few years before another area is cleared for 
seeding with grass.
Road building 
roads have been built through rain forests to 
enable minerals, timber, cattle and crops to  
be moved easily. Roads also bring in new 
settlers who clear areas for farming.
Mining 
large areas of forest are cleared for the 
open-cast mining of minerals such as 
iron, gold and copper.
HEP (hydroelectric power) 
rivers are dammed and huge 
areas of forest are ﬂooded 
as a result.
Land for peasants 
land allows peasants to grow their own 
food and the wood that is cut down 
provides them with fuel. It stops 
overcrowding in other parts of the country.
Why are rainforests being cut down?

rainforests are being cut down
DEFORESTATION
Areas of tropical rainforest are cleared for a variety of reasons (Figure 7.12). 
Trees are felled for timber and sometimes for their medicinal drugs. Large 
areas have been deforested to make land for farming, housing and industry. 
Mining and hydroelectric power (HEP) schemes have also led to land 
clearance. Sometimes, the logging and land clearance is illegal or without any 
sort of control. Some developing country governments have encouraged the 
clearance of forests because:
◼   the revenue earned from selling timber, minerals and the sources of 
medicinal drugs helps to pay off debts and to fund economic development
◼   more land is needed to house and feed the fast-growing populations in 
countries such as Brazil and Malaysia.
DID YOU KNOW?
The causes of deforestation in Brazil 
were examined in Part 5.3 (page 000). 
It is important that you now re-read 
that section.

20 MAGNETISM AND ELECTROMAGNETISM
There are two types of magnets that we use in our everyday lives. These are permanent magnets and electromagnets. 
A permanent magnet has a magnetic field around it all the time. The strength and direction of this field is not easy to 
change. An electromagnet when turned on also has a magnetic field around it but its strength and direction can be 
changed very easily. In this chapter you will learn about the factors affecting the magnetic field around an electromagnet 
and how electromagnets are used in several important devices.
▲ Figure 20.1 Electromagnets can be used to lift iron or steel objects.
The huge electromagnet in Figure 20.1 is being used in a scrapyard to pick up large objects that contain iron or steel. 
When the objects have been moved to their new position the electromagnet is turned off and the objects fall. 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
◼
Know that magnets repel and attract other magnets 
and attract magnetic substances
◼
Describe the properties of magnetically hard and soft 
materials
◼
Practical: investigate the magnetic field pattern for a 
permanent bar magnet and between two bar magnets
◼
Understand the term magnetic field line
◼
Know that magnetism is induced in some materials 
when they are placed in a magnetic field
◼
Describe how to use two permanent magnets to 
produce a uniform magnetic field pattern
◼
Know that an electric current in a conductor produces 
a magnetic field around it
PHYSICS ONLY
◼
Describe the construction of electromagnets
◼
Draw magnetic field patterns for a straight wire, 
a flat circular coil and a solenoid when each is 
carrying a current
MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS
Magnets are able to attract objects made from magnetic materials such as iron, 
steel, nickel and cobalt. Magnets cannot attract objects made from materials such 
as plastic, wood, paper or rubber. These are non-magnetic materials.
UNITS
In this section you will need to use 
ampere (A) as the unit of current, volt 
(V) as the unit of voltage and watt (W) 
as the unit of power.
Physics Only sections 
show the content 
that is on the Physics 
specification only and 
not the Double Award 
specification. All other 
content in this book 
applies to Double Award 
students.
Learning Objectives 
show what you will learn 
in each Chapter.
Units boxes tell you 
which units – for 
example, metres, grams 
and seconds – you will 
need to know and use 
for the study of a topic.
ABOUT THIS BOOK
This book is written for students following the Edexcel International GCSE (9–1) Physics specification and 
the Edexcel International GCSE (9–1) Science Double Award specification. You will need to study all of 
the content in this book for your Physics examination. However, you will only need to study some of it if 
you are taking the Double Award specification. The book clearly indicates which content is in the Physics 
examination and not in the Double Award specification. To complete the Double Award course you will also 
need to study the Biology and Chemistry parts of the course.
In each unit of this book, there are concise explanations and worked examples, plus numerous exercises 
that will help you build up confidence. The book also describes the methods for carrying out all of the 
required practicals.
The language throughout this textbook is graded for speakers of English as an additional language (EAL), 
with advanced Physics specific terminology highlighted and defined in the glossary at the back of the book. 
A list of command words, also at the back of the book, will help you to learn the language you will need in 
your examination. 
You will also find that questions in this book have Progression icons and Skills tags. The Progression icons 
refer to Pearson's Progression scale. This scale – from 1 to 12 – tells you what level you have reached 
in your learning and will help you to see what you need to do to progress to the next level. Furthermore, 
Edexcel have developed a Skills grid showing the skills you will practise throughout your time on the 
course. The skills in the grid have been matched to questions in this book to help you see which skills  
you are developing. You can find Pearson's Progression scale and Edexcel's Skills grid at  
www.pearsonschoolsandfecolleges.co.uk along with guidelines on how to use them.

SOLIDS, LIQUIDS AND GASES
SOLIDS, LIQUIDS AND GASES
We use the following equation to work out how much energy is needed to 
change the temperature of an object by a given amount:
change in thermal energy, ΔQ (joules) = mass, m (kilograms) × specific 
heat capacity, c × change in temperature, Δθ (°C)
ΔQ = m × c × Δθ
If you fill a kettle with 300 g of water at an initial temperature of 15 °C, how 
much energy is needed to make the water heat up to boiling? The s.h.c. of 
water is 4200 J/kg °C. 
Write down what you know: 
m = 0.3 kg (you must work in consistent units)
c = 4200 J/kg °C 
and, as the boiling point of water is 100 °C, Δθ = 85 °C
Write down the equation you are using (no marks for this as it is a given 
equation):
ΔQ = m × c × Δθ 
Substitute the correct values into the equation (this will normally attract a 
method mark).
ΔQ = 0.3 kg × 4200 J/kg °C × 85 °C
Now complete the calculation and include the correct unit in your 
answer. 
ΔQ = 107 100 J
EXAMPLE 1
ACTIVITY 1
▼ PRACTICAL: INVESTIGATE THE SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY 
OF A SUBSTANCE
Rearranging the equation above to make c the subject we get:
c =   ΔQ 
_______
m × Δθ  
So we must:
◼ measure the mass, m, in kg of the substance under test using

KEY POINT
Δ, the Greek letter delta, means a 
change in the quantity that follows it. 
θ, the Greek letter theta, is used to 
represent temperature so Δθ (delta 
theta) means a change in temperature.
If we cool something down then Δθ is 
negative and so, therefore, is ΔQ. This 
simply means that, to cool something 
down, we need to remove thermal 
energy from it. 
EXTENSION WORK
This figure assumes that all the thermal 
energy provided goes to raise the 
temperature of the water. In practice 
some energy will be used to heat up 
the kettle and some will be lost to the 
surroundings through thermal radiation, 
thermal conduction and convection 
and some water will evaporate before 
the boiling point is reached.
The immersion heater will get hot 
enough to burn the skin, as will the 
metal block in time. If used in water the 
immersion heater must not have its top 
immersed.

modification of work by NASA/Concepts of Biology OpenStax) 
Viewed from space, Earth offers very few clues about the diversity of life forms that can be 
found there. The first forms of life on Earth are thought to have been microorganisms that 
existed for billions of years before plants and animals appeared. Mammals, birds, and flowers are 
all relatively recent additions to the planet, originating 130 to 200 million years ago. Humans 
have only inhabited this planet for the last 2.5 million years, and only in the last 200,000 years 
have humans started looking like we do today. 
1.1 Themes and Concepts of Biology 
 
Biology is the science that studies life. What exactly is life? This may sound like a silly question 
with an obvious answer; however, it is not always easy to define life. For example, a branch of 
biology called virology studies viruses. Viruses exhibit some of the characteristics of life but 
lack others. It turns out that although viruses can attack living organisms, cause diseases, and 
even reproduce with the help of host cells, they do not meet all the criteria that biologists use to 
define life. 
From its earliest beginnings, biology has wrestled with four questions: What are the shared 
properties that make something “alive”? How do those various living things function? Planet

earth has a diversity of life forms; how do we organize and classify these different organisms? 
Finally, how did this diversity arise, and how is it continuing? As new organisms are discovered 
every day, biologists continue to seek answers to these and other questions. 
Properties of Life 
All living organisms share the following key characteristics: order, response to stimuli, 
reproduction, adaptation, growth and development, homeostasis, and energy processing. These 
seven characteristics serve to define life. It is essential that students know these different 
properties of life and be able to explain each. 
Order 
Organisms are highly organized and consist of one or more cells. Even very simple, single-celled 
organisms are remarkably complex. Inside each cell, atoms come together through chemical 
bonding and form molecules. Molecules come together to form cell components or structures 
called organelles. Like the toad shown in Figure 1.2, 
multicellular organisms can consist of millions of 
cells. Different groups of cells then specialize in 
performing specific functions.  Without order, 
specialization would not be possible. 
Figure 1.2 A toad represents a highly organized 
individual. (credit: ""Ivengo(RUS)""/Wikimedia 
Commons) 
 
Response to Stimuli 
Organisms respond to diverse stimuli. For example, plants can bend toward a source of light or 
respond to touch (Figure 1.3). Even tiny bacteria can move toward or away from chemicals, a 
process called chemotaxis. A movement toward a stimulus is considered a positive response, 
while movement away from a stimulus is regarded as a negative response. 
Humans also respond to stimuli. For example, when we become warm on a hot sunny day, the 
body has tiny glands called sudoriferous, or sweat, 
glands that make and release sweat onto the skin's 
surface. The heat from the body can be transferred to 
the sweat, which acts as a cooling mechanism and 
helps to maintain constant body temperature. 
Figure 1.3 The leaves of this sensitive plant (Mimosa 
pudica) will instantly droop and fold when touched. 
After a few minutes, the plant returns to its normal 
state. (credit: Alex Lomas/Concepts of Biology

allopatric speciation: a speciation that occurs via a geographic separation  
allosomes: chromosome pair twenty-three and determines a person’s sex  
allosteric activation: the mechanism for activating enzyme action in which a regulatory 
molecule binds to a second site (not the active site) and initiates a conformation change in the 
active site, allowing binding with the substrate 
allosteric inhibition: the mechanism for inhibiting enzyme action in which a regulatory 
molecule binds to a second site (not the active site) and initiates a conformation change in the

The AQA GCSE French, Spanish and German specifications are divided into three main subject areas, 
called Themes. 
Our Foundation and Higher Student Books have been approved by AQA. They are divided up in the same 
way, with colour-coding to help you know where you are. Each Theme is divided into four Topics, making 
a total of twelve Topics to study during the course.
Each one of these skills has its own separate exam, 
in the form of an end-of-course paper.

 Read the four blog entries. Complete each sentence by 
writing the name of the person.
1 
 has a girlfriend the same age as he is.
2 
 does not get on with his brother.
3 
 has occasional arguments with her parents.
4 
 is a little shy.
5 
 is sweet and very clever.
6 
 likes going out with her best friend.
Ignoring words which are  
not needed
Even though it is good to 
understand every word in a text, 
it is not absolutely essential. 
Read the task or questions you 
have to deal with and look for the 
answers in the text. If you can 
complete the task, you have done 
well. If not, try to locate where 
the answer should be and use the 
context and your knowledge of 
English to help you. For example, 
agréable means ‘agreeable’ or 
‘pleasant’ and égoïste means 
‘egotistical’ or ‘selfish’.
 Stratégie
Tu t’entends bien avec ta famille 
et tes amis?
J’ai une petite amie qui s’appelle Emma. Elle a 
quinze ans comme moi. Elle est un peu timide 
mais elle est la fille la plus sympa et la plus 
amusante de la classe. Nous avons beaucoup 
de choses en commun. Nous nous entendons 
super bien. Moi, je l’adore. Arthur
Mon petit frère a sept ans. Il est moins gentil 
et agréable que ma sœur. Il est égoïste et il 
est jaloux de tout le monde. En plus, il est 
paresseux et parfois méchant. Je ne m’entends 
pas bien avec lui et souvent, nous nous 
fâchons. Je le trouve vraiment difficile. Louis
Lilou est ma meilleure amie. Elle est 
mignonne et la plus intelligente de la classe. 
On s’entend bien toutes les deux. On a les 
mêmes goûts et j’aime beaucoup sortir avec 
elle le weekend. Jade
Je m’entends aussi bien avec mes parents 
qu’avec mes amis. Mes parents et moi nous 
disputons rarement et ils ne se fâchent pas 
avec moi. Ma mère est plus généreuse et plus 
gentille que mon père qui est trop sévère. Il ne 
me laisse pas sortir le soir. Camille
