0,"@@@TOPIC IA — BIOLOGICAL MOLECULES: CARBOHYDRATES AND COMMON BIOCHEMISTRY
Even though there is, and has been, a huge variety of different organisms on Earth, they all share some biochemistry— for example, they all contain a few carbon-based compounds that interact in similar ways.

@@@MOST CARBOHYDRATES ARE POLYMERS
1) Most carbohydrates (as well as proteins and nucleic acids) are polymers.
2) Polymers are large, complex molecules composed of long chains of monomers joined together.
3) Monomers are small, basic molecular units.
4) Examples of monomers include monosaccharides, amino acids and nucleotides.
monomer e.g. monosaccharide, amino acid polymer e.g. carbohydrate, protein

@@@CARBOHYDRATES ARE MADE FROM MONOSACCHARIDES
1) All carbohydrates contain the elements C, H and O.
2) The monomers that they're made from are monosaccharides, e.g. glucose, fructose and galactose.
1) Glucose is a hexose sugar — a monosaccharide with six carbon atoms in each molecule.
2) There are two types of glucose, alpha (α) and beta (β)— they're isomers (molecules with the same molecular formula as each other, but with the atoms connected in a different way).
3) You need to know the structures of both types of glucose for your exam— it's pretty easy because there's only one difference between the two:
α-glucose molecule β-glucose molecule
The two types of glucose have these groups reversed

@@@CONDENSATION REACTIONS JOIN MONOSACCHARIDES TOGETHER
1) A condensation reaction is when two molecules join together with the formation of a new chemical bond, and a water molecule is released when the bond is formed.
2) Monosaccharides are joined together by condensation reactions.
3) A glycosidic bond forms between the two monosaccharides as a molecule of water is released.
4) A disaccharide is formed when two monosaccharides join together.
Example
Two α-glucose molecules are joined together by a glycosidic bond to form maltose.
5) Sucrose is a disaccharide formed from a condensation reaction between a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule.
6) Lactose is another disaccharide formed from a glucose molecule and a galactose molecule.
If you're asked to show a condensation reaction, don't forget to put the water molecule in as a product."

Even though there is, and has been, a huge variety of different organisms on Earth, they all share some biochemistry— for example, they all contain a few carbon-based compounds that interact in similar ways.

@@@Carbohydrate Structure and Monomer Definition
Most carbohydrates (as well as proteins and nucleic acids) are polymers. Polymers are large, complex molecules composed of long chains of monomers joined together. Monomers are small, basic molecular units. Examples of monomers include monosaccharides, amino acids, and nucleotides. Carbohydrates are made from monosaccharides, which contain the elements C, H, and O. The monomers that carbohydrates are made from are monosaccharides, for example, glucose, fructose, and galactose. Glucose is a hexose sugar — a monosaccharide with six carbon atoms in each molecule. There are two types of glucose, alpha (α) and beta (β) — they're isomers, molecules with the same molecular formula as each other but with the atoms connected in a different way. You need to know the structures of both types of glucose for your exam— it's pretty easy because there's only one difference between the two: α-glucose and β-glucose have the atom groups at the position of carbon number one reversed.

@@@The Formation of Disaccharides Through Condensation Reactions
A condensation reaction is when two molecules join together with the formation of a new chemical bond, and a water molecule is released when the bond is formed. Monosaccharides are joined together by condensation reactions. A glycosidic bond forms between the two monosaccharides as a molecule of water is released. A disaccharide is formed when two monosaccharides join together. For example, two α-glucose molecules are joined together by a glycosidic bond to form maltose. Sucrose is a disaccharide formed from a condensation reaction between a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule. Lactose is another disaccharide formed from a glucose molecule and a galactose molecule. If you're asked to show a condensation reaction, don't forget to include the water molecule as a product.

@@@Hydrolysis Reactions and the Breakdown of Polymers
Polymers can be broken down into monomers by hydrolysis reactions. A hydrolysis reaction breaks the chemical bond between monomers using a water molecule. It's the opposite of a condensation reaction. For example, carbohydrates can be broken down into their constituent monosaccharides by hydrolysis reactions. 

@@@Testing for Sugars Using the Benedict’s Test
Sugar is a general term for monosaccharides and disaccharides. All sugars can be classified as reducing or non-reducing. The Benedict's test is used for detecting the presence of sugars and differs depending on the type of sugar you are testing for. Reducing sugars include all monosaccharides (e.g., glucose) and some disaccharides (e.g., maltose and lactose). To perform the test, you add Benedict's reagent, which is blue, to a sample and heat it in a water bath that's been brought to the boil. If the test is positive, it will form a coloured precipitate. The colour of the precipitate changes from blue to green, to yellow, to orange, and then brick red. The higher the concentration of reducing sugar, the further the colour change goes; this allows you to compare the amount of reducing sugar in different solutions. A more accurate way of doing this is to filter the solution and weigh the precipitate. Always use an excess of Benedict's solution to ensure all the sugar reacts. If the result of the reducing sugars test is negative, there could still be a non-reducing sugar present. To test for non-reducing sugars, like sucrose, you have to break them down into monosaccharides by treating a new sample with dilute hydrochloric acid and carefully heating it in a water bath to the boil. Then you neutralize it with sodium hydrogencarbonate and perform the Benedict's test as you would for a reducing sugar. If the test is positive, a coloured precipitate will form. If the test is negative, the solution remains blue, indicating it does not contain any sugar (either reducing or non-reducing)."
2,"@@@Overview of Eukaryotic Cells and Organelles

Eukaryotic cells contain a variety of organelles, each with specific functions crucial to the life of the cell. The majority of these organelles are membrane-bound, which is a source of common confusion. It's essential to remember that these organelles are not independent cells but parts of a larger cell. This segment emphasizes the need to understand both the structure and function of these organelles.

@@@Cell-surface (Plasma) Membrane

The cell-surface membrane plays a pivotal role in regulating the passage of substances in and out of the cell. It acts as a selective barrier for animal cells and is found just inside the cell wall of other cells. Made predominantly from lipids and proteins, this structure is equipped with receptor molecules, making it responsive to chemicals such as hormones.

@@@Nucleus

The nucleus, surrounded by a double membrane known as the nuclear envelope, administers the cell's activities by controlling DNA transcription. The nuclear envelope is perforated with pores that allow substances like RNA to move between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Inside the nucleus are chromosomes consisting of protein-bound linear DNA, along with one or more nucleoli, which are responsible for making ribosomes.

@@@Mitochondrion

Mitochondria are often oval-shaped organelles with a double membrane, where the inner membrane forms cristae. Within the internal matrix, enzymes involved in respiration are located. Mitochondria are the sites of aerobic respiration and ATP production, which is particularly important in cells that demand a high amount of energy.

@@@Chloroplast

In plant and algal cells, the chloroplast is a small, flattened structure enclosed by a double membrane. Inside are thylakoid membranes, which in parts form structures called grana—these grana are interlinked by lamellae. Chloroplasts are the location for photosynthesis, with the processes occurring in both the grana and the stroma, a dense fluid within the chloroplast.

@@@Golgi Apparatus and Related Structures

The Golgi apparatus consists of a group of fluid-filled, membrane-bound sacs, also known as cisternae, with vesicles frequently seen at their edges. This organelle processes and packages new lipids and proteins and produces lysosomes. Golgi vesicles are small sacs used to store and transport lipids and proteins out of the cell. Lysosomes, which are a form of Golgi vesicle, contain lysozymes that digest invading cells or worn-out cell components.

@@@Ribosomes and Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)

Ribosomes, which may be free-floating in the cytoplasm or attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), are the sites of protein synthesis. They are composed of RNA and proteins but do not have a membrane. The RER is covered with ribosomes and specializes in folding and processing proteins. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), on the other hand, lacks ribosomes and is involved in the synthesis and processing of lipids.

@@@Cell Wall and Cell Vacuole

Surrounding plant cells, algae, and fungal cells is the cell wall—a rigid structure that provides support and maintains the shape of the cell. The plant and algal cell wall is primarily composed of cellulose, while the fungal cell wall is made of chitin. Plant cells also contain a cell vacuole, a large organelle responsible for maintaining cell pressure, which helps prevent wilting and is also involved in isolating unwanted chemicals within the cell. The vacuole's membrane is known as the tonoplast."
3,"@@@Introduction to Business Objectives and Strategies
This chapter delves into AS Level syllabus section 1.4, outlining the significance of business objectives. It articulates that while businesses may state the general objectives in their Memorandum of Association, strategic details are often scant. The chapter aims to shed light on why business objectives are imperative, the variety of goals that can exist, and how they can serve in guiding an organization’s workforce. Objectives provide clarity and a distinct direction for nearly all human endeavors. For businesses, an objective can streamline management, guide decision-making, and warrant that all company actions are aligned with the established targets. 

@@@Understanding the Importance of SMART Objectives
Upon completing this chapter, the reader will comprehend the importance of setting objectives and the necessity for them to be SMART—Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Readers will also gain insights into the connections between mission statements, corporate objectives, and business strategy, the dynamics between objectives and strategies, and the significance of conveying objectives to stakeholders like employees. Moreover, the chapter discusses why objectives may evolve over time and critically examines the influence of corporate social responsibility and ethics on business aims and activities.

@@@Case Study: Health and Beauty for You
June Wong reflects on the success of Health and Beauty for You, which she started with her brother Will. Despite economic challenges and competition, their primary goal of business survival was met over the initial three years. Subsequently, they plan to set new objectives, with June proposing expansion through acquiring another salon to bolster growth, while Will advocates for maximizing profits from the current salon. Through discussion, they arrive at a dual-phase objective: initially, to open a new salon and double sales within three years; subsequently, to focus on long-term profit maximization by enhancing their image and raising prices—with a five-year profit target of $90,000 per year.

@@@Points to Ponder and Case Continuation
The reader is prompted to reflect on the definition of 'objective', the importance of Health and Beauty for You having clear objectives, and the reasons behind June and Will’s prospective shift in business goals over time. Following this, the text details that businesses, from small sole-trader enterprises to large corporations, benefit from clear and well-defined objectives. While sole traders might not formalize their goals, they typically have a clear vision. The importance of aligned objectives for partnerships and the necessity for limited companies to declare their overarching business objectives are highlighted. Businesses need to frequently review their strategies to ensure continuous alignment with objectives, acknowledging that objectives and strategies may change with time; for example, a shift in objective likely necessitates a revised strategy.

@@@Exploring the Attributes of Effective Business Objectives
The text then details that the most effective business objectives are characterized by the SMART criteria, providing specific examples for each of the 'SMART' components. It emphasizes setting specific goals pertinent to a business’s nature, establishing measurable targets, ensuring objectives are realistically achievable, aligning them with the company’s resources, and setting clear time frames.

@@@Understanding the Hierarchy of Business Objectives and Strategies
An analysis follows on the distinction between corporate aims, mission statements, objectives, and strategies, exemplified through a hierarchy of objectives figure. The case of Daimler Mercedes-Benz is presented, showcasing a corporate goal of achieving profitable growth and leading the automobile industry. Corporate aims are discussed as broad and overarching, providing directional guidance across the various aspects and levels of a business. The reader is engaged through an activity to explain the benefits of company aims and objectives to Daimler, complementing the detailed exploration of business objectives provided in the chapter."
4,"@@@The Significance of Objectives in Decision-Making
Effective decision-making in business management is deeply tied to having clear objectives. Managers are tasked with crafting future strategies, which can only be accomplished with a well-defined direction for the business. This crucial relationship between decisions and business objectives is encapsulated in the decision-making framework model depicted in Figure 4.4. The framework for making decisions involves a multi-step process, which includes setting objectives, assessing the problem or situation, gathering relevant data, evaluating decision options, making the strategic decision, implementing the plan, and reviewing its success in the context of the original goals. Without these objectives outlined from the beginning, making any influential decisions for the future of the business would not only be challenging but also unproductive.

@@@The Evolution of Corporate Objectives Over Time
Corporate objectives do not remain static and often evolve, driven by various circumstances. A startup, having achieved initial survival objectives, may shift focus to scaling or profit maximization. Market dynamics such as the emergence of a formidable competitor or economic downturns can compel a firm to adjust its objectives, shifting from aggressive expansion back to mere survival or revising sales and profit goals downwards. Short-term growth ambitions, such as increasing sales or market share, may transform into long-term profit-maximization aims once a higher sales level is attained.

@@@Determinants of a Business's Corporate Objectives
A myriad of factors can sway the specific objectives set by a business. Corporate culture stands out as a key influencer – it embodies the shared attitudes and behaviors that guide the decision-making of managers and employees within an organization. Depending on whether the corporate culture is aggressive and competitive or socially conscious and people-oriented, the business's objectives will significantly vary. Moreover, the size and legal structure of a business play vital roles; smaller companies often pursue a satisfactory profit level, while larger enterprises, especially those separated from owner management, may prioritize growth for increased managerial prestige and benefits. Public-sector organizations usually don’t target profit maximization due to the nature of their services which are frequently non-profit-driven like education and health. Figure 4.4 showcases a decision-making framework, with its stages from objective setting to review against objectives, implying the diverse factors that can shape business objectives."
5,"@@@Introduction to Objectives and Decision-Making in Business
Effective decision-making requires clear objectives. Business managers cannot decide on future plans of action – strategies – if they are uncertain of which direction they want to take the business in. This essential link between decisions and objectives is illustrated in the decision-making framework model shown in Figure 4.4. The stages in this decision-making framework are: 1. Set objectives. 2. Assess the problem or situation. 3. Gather data about the problem and possible solutions. 4. Consider all decision options. 5. Make the strategic decision. 6. Plan and implement the decision. 7. Review its success against the original objectives. Clearly, without setting relevant objectives at the start of this process, effective decision-making for the future of the business becomes impossible.

@@@The Evolution of Corporate Objectives
There are many examples of businesses changing their corporate objectives over time. These are some of the reasons for this: 1. A newly formed business may have satisfied the ‘survival’ objective by operating for several years, and now the owners wish to pursue objectives of growth or increased profit. 2. The competitive and economic environment may change, so the entry into the market of a powerful rival or the start of an economic recession may lead a firm to switch from growth to survival as its main aim – or even just to revise its objectives for sales and profits downwards. 3. A short-term objective of growth in sales or market share might be adapted to a longer-term objective of maximizing profits from the higher level of sales.

@@@Factors Influencing Corporate Objectives
Several factors influence the nature of the objectives established for any business. The corporate culture is a chief among these and can be defined as the code of behavior and attitudes that influence the decision-making style of the managers and other employees of the business. The size and legal form of the business also play a role, with small business owners possibly aiming for satisfactory profit or 'satisficing', while larger businesses may strive for rapid growth to increase the status and power of managers. This is often a result of the ‘divorce between ownership and control,’ which nearly always exists in large companies with professional directors who do not own it. Additionally, public-sector and private-sector businesses have different focuses, with state-owned organizations not prioritizing profit and possibly setting objectives like 'quality of service' measures. Contrastingly, businesses earning revenue in the public sector may aim to maintain services in non-profitable locations.

@@@Impact of Ethical Considerations on Objectives and Decision-Making
Ethics play a significant role in shaping business objectives and decision-making. Businesses face ethical dilemmas such as whether to use aggressive marketing to children, accept bribes, support ethically controversial industries, employ environmentally-friendly practices at the expense of profits, or address issues related to pay inequality and labor conditions. The ethical code or code of conduct of a company details the mandatory behavior and guidelines that all employees must follow. The growing acceptance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) has led to more businesses considering the ethical implications of their actions in making decisions that extend beyond just profit impact.

@@@Dissemination and Management of Objectives Within the Business
Communicating business objectives to employees is essential. If employees are unaware of the company goals, they cannot contribute efficiently to achieving them. By involving employees in the setting of objectives and clearly communicating business goals, the business is likely to benefit from enhanced employee performance through a greater understanding of both their individual and the company's collective goals. A clear objectives framework aligns employee responsibilities and facilitates monitoring and support by management. Knowledge of objectives helps employees see the bigger picture and understand their role, which is critical for the company to operate cohesively and achieve its mission. This process of cascading goals is referred to as management by objectives (MBO), wherein corporate aims are divided into specific targets at every level of the organization: aim, corporate objectives, divisional objectives, departmental objectives, and individual targets, ensuring alignment and coordination between all levels for successful achievement."
6,"@@@Introduction to Prokaryotes and the Scale of Evolution

1 Cell biology explores various types of cells, including prokaryotes. The text explains that all bacterial cells are prokaryotic, indicating that bacteria fall under this category. Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms without a nucleus to contain their genetic material, and they are often smaller than eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes potentially evolved earlier than eukaryotic cells, as suggested by evolutionary evidence. With individual bacterial cells typically ranging between 1 µm and 10 µm in length, understanding the size comparison is vital; 1000 micrometres (µm) equal one millimetre (mm), translating to hundreds of bacteria that can fit within this small space. Despite their size, prokaryotes are significant in the history of life. Some scientists believe prokaryotes appeared about 3.5 billion years ago, relatively shortly after the Earth's crust formed. A visualization scale demonstrates the proportion of time various organisms, including prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, fish, land plants, and humans, have been present in the grand timeline. Key terms like ""Prokaryotic cells"" and ""Prokaryote"" are also defined for clarity.

@@@Understanding Bacterial Cell Composition and Size Comparison

9 A typical bacterial cell, a prokaryote, can be viewed as represented in Figure 1.4, which magnifies its structure and showcases its components. The functions of bacterial cell components such as the cytoplasm, cell wall, DNA, plasmid DNA, flagellum, cell-surface membrane, and ribosomes are highlighted in Table 1.1. Each component has a crucial role from providing cell support, enabling genetic variation, aiding in cell movement, controlling substance exchange, to facilitating respiration and protein synthesis. This section elucidates that bacterial prokaryotic cells lack mitochondria for respiration, a feature present in eukaryotic cells. Another visual representation, Figure 1.5, offers a perspective on the size of bacterial cells compared to a pinhead, underscoring the microscopic scale of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Additional tips aim to reinforce learning about cell structures while key terms like ""Chromosome,"" ""Mitochondrion,"" and ""Respiration"" are explained. Lastly, questions for self-assessment encourage readers to reflect on the unique characteristics of prokaryotic cells, the types of organisms with a single loop of DNA, differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, the role of ribosomes, and the reasoning behind the hypothesis that prokaryotic cells evolved first."
7,"@@@Introduction to Cell Biology: Understanding Animal and Plant Cells

Plant and animal cells are eukaryotic, meaning they may consist of single or multiple cells and contain a nucleus, generally being larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells. A simplified animal cell structure is depicted in Figure 1.6, designed to highlight key components for easier identification. Both types of cells are explored, including a visualization of a generalised animal cell at a microscopic level, shown both three- and two-dimensionally.

@@@Key Components of Animal Cells and Their Functions

Animal cells share several components with bacterial cells, as seen in the cytoplasm, which contains mainly water, ribosomes, and is the site for numerous chemical reactions, like protein synthesis. The cell-surface membrane of animal cells, which lacks a cell wall, is the outermost part of these cells and regulates the inflow and outflow of substances, such as gases and nutrients, by diffusion. Mitochondria, eukaryotic cell-specific organelles, serve as the primary sites of cellular respiration, releasing energy for vital life processes. Their high-energy demand is indicated by the abundance of mitochondria in cells that perform intense activities. In comparison, ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis, with the term 'Diffusion' being defined as the movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to one of lower concentration. The paragraph also emphasizes the uniqueness of animal cells due to their possession of nuclei and different components within the cytoplasm compared to bacterial cells.

@@@Characteristics of Generalized Plant Cells

Like animal cells, plant cells are also eukaryotic with a nucleus and comparatively larger than bacterial cells. Figure 1.7 illustrates a generalized plant cell under microscopic magnification, including both three-dimensional and two-dimensional representations.

@@@Unique Components in Plant Cells

The structure and function of plant cells are described, highlighting the similarities they share with animal cells like possessing a nucleus with DNA, ribosomes, and mitochondria. However, plant cells also contain unique components, such as chloroplasts filled with chlorophyll, necessary for photosynthesis, through which light energy is used to create glucose and oxygen. Plant cells also exhibit cell walls made of cellulose, providing structural support essential for the plants to remain upright and capture sunlight. Photosynthesis is defined as the endothermic reaction storing energy in glucose. Additionally, plant cells often contain a large, central vacuole that helps maintain the cell's turgidity. The term 'Turgid' refers to the state of being swollen in cells.

@@@Examining Plant Cells Through Practical Observation

A detailed method for scrutinizing the cells of onions and pond weed under a microscope is presented, offering step-by-step procedural instructions. It concludes with a set of questions aimed at differentiating between the observed cells of the two specimens and inquiring about the organelles typically absent in animal cells. In addition to the practical tips and questions, a series of test questions are posed to reinforce learning and understanding about the structures unique to plant cells, the occurrence of mitochondria, and the roles of the cytoplasm and mitochondria. The section concludes with an explanation of why sperm cells harbor a large number of mitochondria."
8,"@@@Introduction to Cell Specialisation  
The previous section examined generalised animal and plant cells. However, eukaryotic organisms like humans are composed of specialised cells uniquely tailored to perform specific functions. Red blood cells are an example; their biconcave shape and the absence of a nucleus optimise their oxygen absorption. This section will detail key specialised cells in animals and plants, highlighting their particular adaptations.

@@@Sperm Cell Specialization  
During male ejaculation, semen containing tens of millions of sperm cells is released. These sperm cells must swim through the cervix into the fallopian tubes, where they may fertilize an egg cell. To enable this journey, sperm cells are equipped with a tail for propulsion and numerous mitochondria to release energy from glucose during respiration. This energy is essential for their persistent movement. The nucleus carries the paternal genetic material, half of what will become the offspring's DNA. At the sperm's forefront is an acrosome containing digestive enzymes that can penetrate an ovum's outer layer, facilitating fertilization (Figure 1.10).

@@@Nerve Cell Function and Structure  
The nervous system, comprising the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), oversees both voluntary and involuntary body actions. The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord, while the PNS incorporates nerve cells that connect to the CNS and spread throughout the body. Electrical impulses travel along nerve cells, conducting vital signals. Some nerve cells have extensive axons insulated by myelin sheaths to expedite signal transmission, reflecting the importance of speed in nerve signal relay. The nerve cell body also possesses dendrites to receive signals from adjacent cells (Figure 1.11).

@@@Muscle Cell Types and Adaptations  
Our bodies have three muscle types: smooth, cardiac, and skeletal. Smooth muscle, found in the circulatory system and iris, contracts automatically, as does cardiac muscle in the heart. In contrast, skeletal muscle, usually attached to bones, is under voluntary control. Muscle cells possess abundant mitochondria to harness glucose's energy during respiration, enabling sustained contraction (Figure 1.13).

@@@Root Hair Cell Structure  
Root hair cells extend into the soil to maximize the root's surface area in contact with the soil, allowing plants to absorb more water and minerals. The extensive network of these hair-like structures facilitates vital water uptake (Figure 1.14).

@@@Xylem and Phloem Cell Functions  
Xylem cells, forming long tubes fortified with lignin fibers, transport water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant. Meanwhile, phloem cells move glucose from photosynthesis throughout the plant for immediate use or storage. Xylem tubes consist of dead cells that merge to create channels for water transmission, while phloem cells, being living, feature sieve plates to speed up sugar transport (Figures 1.15 and 1.16).

@@@Cell Differentiation Process  
After formation, generalized cells become specialized through cell differentiation. This occurs as an organism develops, with cells acquiring specific internal structures to perform distinct functions. For example, muscle cells contain numerous mitochondria to meet their energy demands during respiration. Notably, most plant cells retain the capacity to differentiate for their entire lifespan, a property essential for practices like taking plant cuttings (Chapter 14 to be covered later).

@@@Microscopy's Historical Development  
Although the exact origin of the microscope is unclear, it likely arose in the 1590s in The Netherlands among eyeglass makers. Significant advancements include Robert Hooke's usage of 'cell' in 1665 from his observations in Micrographia, and van Leeuwenhoek's later discovery of sperm cells and bacteria. These developments revolutionized scientific understanding by revealing single-celled organisms previously unknown (Figure 1.18).

@@@Test Yourself and Application of Knowledge  
To assess comprehension, several questions prompt the reader to state the functions of nerve cells, enumerate their components, and describe red blood cells' and root hair cells' adaptations. Another task challenges the reader to explain why animals and plants possess specialized cells. A tip is provided for optimizing microscope use, highlighting the importance of this tool in cell biology."
9,"@@@Introduction to Cell Specialization
The previous section looked at generalized animal and plant cells. Eukaryotic organisms, like us, are not usually made of generalized cells. We have developed specialized cells that have adaptations to allow them to complete specific functions. Red blood cells, for example, have a biconcave shape (which dips in the middle on both sides) and no nucleus to maximize their surface area to absorb more oxygen. Key specialized cells for animals and plants, together with their adaptations, are listed below.

@@@Sperm Cell Specialization
In humans, during a male orgasm about a teaspoon of semen is ejaculated. Within this are tens of millions of sperm cells, which must swim through the cervix and uterus to the fallopian tubes. Here one cell may fertilize an egg cell (ovum). Sperm cells have a tail to propel them towards the ovum (Figure 1.10). They have a relatively large number of mitochondria to release the energy from glucose during respiration. This is needed to keep them swimming. The nucleus of a human sperm contains the genetic material (DNA) of the father. This will make up half of the DNA of the baby. At the front of a sperm is an acrosome. This contains digestive enzymes, which break down the outer layer of the ovum, allowing the sperm to enter and fertilize it.

@@@Nerve Cell Specialization
Our nervous system controls and coordinates all our actions. These can be either voluntary actions (like picking up the television remote control) or involuntary actions (like our heart beating faster when we exercise). There are two main parts to our nervous system. The first is our central nervous system (CNS), which is made up of our brain and spinal cord. The other is our peripheral nervous system (PNS), which is all the other nerve cells that connect to the CNS but then spread out across the body. To control our actions, signals must be sent and received. These signals are electrical impulses that travel along nerve cells. To keep these signals moving quickly, some of our nerve cells are the longest cells in our body. Their long extensions are called axons and these have a myelin sheath surrounding much of their length (Figure 1.11). This acts like the plastic coating on an electrical wire and insulates the electrical impulse. The cell body of the nerve also has smaller extensions called dendrites, which allow it to pick up signals from neighboring cells.

@@@Muscle Cell Specialization
There are three types of muscle in our bodies, all of which can contract and relax. Smooth muscle contracts and relaxes automatically and is found in places such as the linings of the vessels that make up our circulatory system and the iris of our eyes. Cardiac muscle also contracts and relaxes automatically and is found in our heart. The third type is skeletal muscle, which is usually found attached to our bones. We control the contractions of this type of muscle, so its movements are not automatic. All three types of muscle are made from muscle cells (Figure 1.13). These are long thin cells full of mitochondria. In the mitochondria, the energy from glucose is released during respiration. This energy allows the muscle to keep on contracting.

@@@Root Hair Cell Specialization
Root hair cells have a small thin extension, which pokes out into the soil (Figure 1.14). Many plants have such high numbers of long root hairs that they can look like a spider's web. The purpose of these hairs is to increase the surface area of the root that is in contact with the soil. This allows the plant to absorb more water and minerals from the soil. A single rye plant has billions of root hairs, which have a total length of hundreds of miles. Without these, it is likely that the adult plant would not be able to absorb enough water to survive."
10,"@@@CELL BIOLOGY AND CELL DIFFERENTIATION
Cell biology explores the diverse functionalities and structures of cells. A crucial aspect of this field is cell differentiation, a process through which generalized cells become specialized to perform specific functions during an organism's development. This specialization allows cells to acquire unique structures that enable them to execute their designated roles efficiently. For instance, muscle cells develop numerous mitochondria to meet their high energy demands during respiration. In contrast to animal cells, which lose the ability to differentiate after a certain stage, plant cells can continue to differentiate throughout their lives, a trait essential for practices like taking plant cuttings.

@@@MICROSCOPY: A HISTORICAL OVERVIEW
The origins of microscopy are not crystal clear, but the first microscope is thought to have been created in the 1590s by Dutch eyeglass makers. A significant leap came in 1665 when Robert Hooke’s publication, ""Micrographia,"" introduced the term 'cell' after observing plant cells reminiscent of a honeycomb's cells. Later, in the mid-1670s, scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered sperm cells and bacteria, vastly expanding the understanding of single-celled organisms.

@@@PRACTICAL MICROSCOPY TIPS AND COMPONENTS OF LIGHT MICROSCOPES
Modern microscopes may look different from the early iterations used by Hooke and van Leeuwenhoek, but the commonality lies in their use of magnifying lenses. A light microscope has several key parts highlighted in Table 1.2. The eyepiece lens and objective lenses of varying magnification, stage, specimen placement, lighting mirrors, and focus adjustments all play fundamental roles in the microscopy process. The total magnification of an observed sample is determined by multiplying the magnifications of the eyepiece and objective lenses.

@@@ADVANCEMENTS IN MICROSCOPY: ELECTRON MICROSCOPES
The development of electron microscopes, initiated by Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll's transmission electron microscope (TEM) in 1931, marked a significant progress in microscopic technology. Later, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) by Manfred von Ardenne allowed for detailed three-dimensional imaging. Electron microscopes operate using beams of electrons resulting in much higher magnification and resolution compared to light microscopes. The TEM provides flat, cross-sectional images, while the SEM delivers more three-dimensional representations. Despite their monochromatic output, electron microscope images are sometimes colorized for visual impact. The concept of resolution, the smallest distinguishable distance between two points, is substantially enhanced in electron microscopes, achieving separation of as little as 0.1 nm compared to the 200 nm resolution limit of light microscopes."
11,"@@@INTRODUCTION TO EUKARYOTIC CELLS: AN OVERVIEW OF ANIMAL AND PLANT CELLS
Plant and animal cells are eukaryotic. They can be unicellular or belong to multicellular organisms. Eukaryotic cells almost always have a nucleus and are generally larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells. The structure of a generalised animal cell is shown in Figure 1.6. A generalised cell is one that has been simplified to make the key components easier to identify.
▲ Figure 1.6 A generalised animal cell as seen with a microscope (magnified ×4800) and as three- and two-dimensional diagrams.

@@@COMPONENTS OF ANIMAL CELLS: UNDERSTANDING THEIR FUNCTION AND STRUCTURE
In the previous section, we looked at bacterial cells. Animal cells have many components in common with these. The cytoplasm of animal cells is also mainly water and it holds other components such as ribosomes. In the cytoplasm, most of the chemical reactions in the cell happen (such as the making of proteins in ribosomes). The cell-surface membrane of animal cells also surrounds the cell. There are no cell walls in animal cells and so the membrane is on the outside of these cells. The membrane controls what substances go in and out of the cell. Many cells need glucose and oxygen for respiration, and these substances move by diffusion into the cell from the blood, where it is found at a higher concentration. Carbon dioxide moves back into the blood capillaries through the membrane. Mitochondria are small organelles found in the cytoplasm and are only present in eukaryotic cells. They are the site of most of a cell’s respiration. Here the energy stored in glucose is released for the cell to complete the seven life processes. Without this energy, all cells die. More-active cells such as those in muscles or sperm cells usually have more mitochondria because these cells need more energy. Mitochondria have many folds inside them, which make their surface area very large to increase the rate at which energy is released. Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. These organelles are present in the cytoplasm of animal cells.

@@@UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF ANIMAL CELLS: THE CENTRAL ROLE OF THE NUCLEUS
Animal cells are unlike bacterial cells in that they usually possess a nucleus. This component is present in almost all eukaryotic cells. It is found in the cytoplasm and is surrounded by its own membrane. The cell’s genetic material (DNA) is enclosed within it, arranged into shapes called chromosomes. (Red blood cells do not have a nucleus, so they have more room to absorb and carry the maximum amount of oxygen, which is their main function.) Humans are, of course, classified as animals. Many of our cells are like other animal cells.

@@@GENERAL STRUCTURE OF PLANT CELLS: COMPARISON WITH ANIMAL CELLS
Like those belonging to animals, plant cells are eukaryotic. This means that they may belong to single-celled or multicellular organisms, they do have a nucleus and they are generally larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells.

@@@DISTINCTIVE COMPONENTS OF PLANT CELLS: CHLOROPLASTS AND CELL WALLS
Plant cells have many components in common with animal cells, including a nucleus in which the organism’s genetic material (DNA) is found. Plant cells also possess ribosomes for protein synthesis and mitochondria for respiration in their cytoplasm. Plant cells possess some components not present in animal cells. Chloroplasts are small components, full of a green pigment called chlorophyll which is necessary for photosynthesis to occur. This reaction uses light energy from the Sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, and so provides an energy source for the plant. It is the green chlorophyll in plants that gives some of their parts their green color. Most roots are hidden from the Sun and so cannot photosynthesize. They do not have chloroplasts and so are often white, not green. There are huge numbers of chloroplasts in leaf cells. There are often well over half a million per square millimeter of leaf. Plant cells also possess a cell wall, unlike animal cells. This is made from cellulose and provides structure for the cell. Plants would not be able to stand upright to catch light energy from the Sun without cell walls. The cell surface membrane is found inside the cell wall.

KEy TERM

12,"@@@Overview of Eukaryotic Cells and Their Differentiation from Prokaryotic Cells
There are two types of cell — prokaryotic and eukaryotic. The next few pages are about eukaryotic cells and their organelles (all the tiny bits and bobs that you can only see in detail with a fancy microscope). Organisms can be Prokaryotes or Eukaryotes. 1) Prokaryotic organisms are prokaryotic cells (i.e., they're single-celled organisms) and eukaryotic organisms are made up of eukaryotic cells. 2) Both types of cells contain organelles, which are parts of cells— each one has a specific function. Eukaryotic cells are complex and include all animal and plant cells, as well as all cells in algae and fungi. Prokaryotic cells are smaller and simpler, for example, bacteria. See page 28 for more.

@@@Distinctive Features of Animal and Plant Cells
You Need to Know the Structure of Eukaryotic Cells: Eukaryotic cells are generally a bit more complicated than prokaryotic cells. You've probably been looking at animal and plant cell diagrams for years, so hopefully you'll be familiar with some of the bits and pieces. Animal cells have a plasma (cell surface) membrane, rough endoplasmic reticulum, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasm, and mitochondrion. Plant cells have all the same organelles as animal cells but with a few added extras: a cellulose cell wall with plasmodesmata ('channels' for exchanging substances with adjacent cells), a vacuole (compartment that contains cell sap), and of course good old chloroplasts. You might also see starch grains in plant cells, although they're not organelles. Plants use starch grains to store excess sugars.

@@@Characteristics of Algal and Fungal Cells
Algal and Fungal Cells: 1) Algal cells are a lot like plant cells — they have all the same organelles, including a cell wall and chloroplasts. 2) Fungal cells are also a lot like plant cells, but with two key differences: their cell walls are made of chitin, not cellulose, and they don't have chloroplasts because they don't photosynthesize. Algae carry out photosynthesis, like plants, but can be single-celled or multicellular. Fungi include mushrooms and yeast.

@@@Organelles and Their Functions in Eukaryotic Cells
Different Organelles have Different Functions: This giant table contains a big list of organelles — you need to know the structure and function of them all. Sorry. Most organelles are surrounded by membranes, which sometimes causes confusion — don't make the mistake of thinking that a diagram of an organelle is a diagram of a whole cell. They're not cells — they're parts of cells. ORGANELLE DIAGRAM DESCRIPTION FUNCTION: 

Cell-surface (Plasma) Membrane—Regulates the movement of substances into and out of the cell and has receptor molecules for responding to chemicals like hormones. 

Nucleus—Controls the cell's activities (by controlling the transcription of DNA) and is where the nucleolus makes ribosomes. 

Mitochondrion—The site of aerobic respiration, where ATP is produced. 

Chloroplast—The site where photosynthesis takes place in plant and algal cells. 

Golgi Apparatus—Processes and packages new lipids and proteins and makes lysosomes.

Golgi Vesicle—Stores lipids and proteins made by the Golgi apparatus and transports them out of the cell. 

Lysosome—Contains digestive enzymes for breaking down invading cells or worn-out cell components. 

Ribosome—The site where proteins are made. 

Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER)—Folds and processes proteins made at the ribosomes. 

Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER)—Synthesises and processes lipids. 

Cell Wall—Supports cells in plants, algae, and fungi and prevents them from changing shape. 

Cell Vacuole—Helps maintain pressure inside plant cells, keeping them rigid, and isolates unwanted chemicals.

13,"@@@INTRODUCTION TO BIOLOGICAL MOLECULES AND CARBOHYDRATES
The topic of IA focuses on Biological Molecules, emphasizing that all organisms, despite their differences, share some biochemical characteristics. These include various carbon-based compounds that behave in comparable manners. Part of this shared biochemistry involves carbohydrates, which, alongside proteins and nucleic acids, are generally polymers. Polymers are large, complex molecules made up of long chains of monomers, which are small, basic molecular units. Examples of monomers include monosaccharides (simple sugars like glucose, fructose, and galactose), amino acids, and nucleotides.

@@@STRUCTURE OF CARBOHYDRATES
Carbohydrates are composed of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O), and their fundamental building blocks are monosaccharides. Specifically, glucose is highlighted as a hexose sugar, meaning it contains six carbon atoms. Two structural variants of glucose, alpha-glucose and beta-glucose, are mentioned as isomers — compounds with the same formula but different structural arrangements. These two forms have a key structural difference that students need to recognize for their examinations.

@@@FORMATION OF DISACCHARIDES THROUGH CONDENSATION REACTIONS
Monosaccharides combine through condensation reactions, which result in the formation of new chemical bonds and the release of water molecules. Glycosidic bonds are the type of bonds that form between monosaccharides during this process. When two alpha-glucose molecules join, they create maltose, a disaccharide, through such a reaction. Examples of other disaccharides include sucrose, made from glucose and fructose, and lactose, made from glucose and galactose.

@@@BREAKDOWN OF POLYMERS VIA HYDROLYSIS REACTIONS
In contrast to the synthesis seen in condensation reactions, hydrolysis reactions involve the breakdown of polymers into monomers using water molecules. This process, essentially the reverse of condensation, is key to decomposing carbohydrates into their monosaccharide components.

@@@IDENTIFICATION OF SUGARS USING THE BENEDICT’S TEST
The Benedict's test is a method used to identify reducing sugars, which include monosaccharides and some disaccharides like maltose and lactose. The test involves adding a blue Benedict's reagent to the sample and then heating it. If reducing sugars are present, a color change in the solution will occur, ranging from green to brick red, depending on the concentration of the sugar. For non-reducing sugars, additional steps involving acid hydrolysis are required before performing the Benedict's test.

@@@POLYSACCHARIDES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS
After discussing monosaccharides and disaccharides, the focus shifts to polysaccharides, complex carbohydrates formed from more than two monosaccharides. Starch, a primary energy storage material in plants, is comprised of amylose and amylopectin — both polymers of alpha-glucose but with distinct structural properties. An iodine test can be used to identify the presence of starch. Animals store excess glucose as glycogen, a polysaccharide similar to amylopectin but with more extensive branching, allowing for a rapid release of glucose as needed for energy."

@@@Cell Specialization and Organization in Multicellular Organisms
The Organelles in Specialised Cells Vary. In multicellular eukaryotic organisms, cells become specialised to carry out specific functions. A cell's structure (i.e. its shape and the organelles it contains) helps it to carry out its function. Specialised cells are organised into tissues, organs, and organ systems. An example is epithelial cells in the small intestine which have lots of mitochondria — to provide energy for the transport of digested food molecules into the cell. Epithelial cells are grouped into epithelial tissue, and with muscular and glandular tissue, form the stomach as an organ, part of the digestive system, an organ system.

Organelles are crucial and repeatedly show up throughout the chapter, ensuring that understanding their role is essential for grasping further biological concepts."
15,"@@@Analysis of Cell Components
You can use microscopes to look at all the lovely organelles you've been learning about. 

@@@Magnification and Resolution in Microscopy
Magnification is Size, Resolution is Detail. We all know that microscopes produce a magnified image of a sample, but resolution is just as important.

@@@Types of Microscopes: Optical
There are Two Main Types of Microscope — Optical and Electron. Optical (light) microscopes use light to form an image. They have a maximum resolution of about 0.2 micrometres (µm). This means you can't use an optical microscope to view organelles smaller than 0.2 µm. That includes ribosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, and lysosomes. You may be able to make out mitochondria — but not in perfect detail. You can also see the nucleus. The maximum useful magnification of an optical microscope is about x 1500.

@@@Types of Microscopes: Electron
Electron microscopes use electrons to form an image. They have a higher resolution than optical microscopes so give a more detailed image (and can be used to look at more organelles). They have a maximum resolution of about 0.0002 micrometres (µm). (About 1000 times higher than optical microscopes.) The maximum useful magnification of an electron microscope is about x 1,500,000. A micrometre (µm) is three - orders of magnitude smaller than a millimetre (1 µm = 0.001 mm). To convert from µm to mm, divide by 1000. Technological advancements have led to the development of different types of electron microscopes.

@@@Electron Microscopes: Transmission and Scanning
Electron Microscopes are either Scanning or Transmission. Transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) use electromagnets to focus a beam of electrons, which is then transmitted through the specimen. Denser parts of the specimen absorb more electrons, which makes them look darker on the image you end up with. TEMs give high-resolution images, so you can see the internal structure of organelles like chloroplasts. However, they can only be used on thin specimens. Scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) scan a beam of electrons across the specimen. This knocks off electrons from the specimen, which are gathered in a cathode ray tube to form an image. The images show the surface of the specimen, and they can be 3-D. SEMs can be used on thick specimens but give lower resolution images than TEMs.

@@@Preparation of Specimens for Optical Microscopy
You View Specimens Under an Optical Microscope Using Slides. Here's how to prepare a 'temporary mount' of a specimen on a slide: Start by pipetting a small drop of water onto the slide (a strip of clear glass or plastic). Then use tweezers to place a thin section of your specimen on top of the water drop. Add a drop of a stain. Stains are used to highlight objects in a cell. For example, eosin is used to make the cytoplasm show up. Iodine in potassium iodide solution is used to stain starch grains in plant cells. Finally, add the cover slip (a square of clear plastic that protects the specimen). To do so, stand the slip upright on the slide, next to the water droplet. Then carefully tilt and lower it so it covers the specimen. Try not to get any air bubbles under there — they'll obstruct your view of the specimen.

@@@Topic Overview
Topic 2A — Cell Structure and Division"
16,"@@@Analysis of Cell Components: Cell Fractionation Separates Organelles

Suppose you wanted to look at some organelles under an electron microscope. First, you'd need to separate them from the rest of the cell — you can do this by cell fractionation. There are three steps to this technique: (1) Homogenisation — Breaking Up the Cells - Homogenisation can be done in several different ways, e.g., by vibrating the cells or by grinding the cells up in a blender. This breaks up the plasma membrane and releases the organelles into solution. The solution must be kept ice-cold, to reduce the activity of enzymes that break down organelles. The solution should also be isotonic — this means it should have the same concentration of chemicals as the cells being broken down, to prevent damage to the organelles through osmosis. A buffer solution should be added to maintain the pH. (2) Filtration — Getting Rid of the Big Bits - Next, the homogenised cell solution is filtered through a gauze to separate any large cell debris or tissue debris, like connective tissue, from the organelles. The organelles are much smaller than the debris, so they pass through the gauze. (3) Ultracentrifugation — Separating the Organelles - After filtration, you're left with a solution containing a mixture of organelles. To separate a particular organelle from all the others you use ultracentrifugation.

The process of ultracentrifugation involves the following steps: (1) The cell fragments are poured into a tube. The tube is put into a centrifuge and is spun at a low speed. The heaviest organelles, like nuclei, get flung to the bottom of the tube by the centrifuge. They form a thick sediment at the bottom — the pellet. The rest of the organelles stay suspended in the fluid above the sediment — the supernatant. (2) The supernatant is drained off, poured into another tube, and spun in the centrifuge at a higher speed. Again, the heaviest organelle, this time the mitochondria, forms a pellet at the bottom of the tube. The supernatant containing the rest of the organelles is drained off and spun in the centrifuge at an even higher speed. (3) This process is repeated at higher and higher speeds, until all the organelles are separated out. Each time, the pellet at the bottom of the tube is made up of lighter and lighter organelles. Organelles are separated in the following order of mass (from heaviest to lightest): nuclei, mitochondria, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and finally ribosomes. There is also a humorous note relating to the experience of centrifugation and a visual depiction of an endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, lysosomes, mitochondria, and nuclei separated in the order of their mass. For clarity in experiments, if interested in observing mitochondria specifically, it's suggested to homogenise, filter, and ultracentrifuge first, and then decide whether to use a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) or Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), taking into account their limitations.

@@@Cell Division — Investigating Mitosis

It's time to dust off your lab coat and get out your safety specs. Here are all the techniques you need to study mitosis. You'll need to know how to stain root cells on slides and how to use an optical microscope and graticules. Root Tips Can be Stained and Squashed to Observe Mitosis - To observe the stages of mitosis, you need to prepare and stain a root tip. Safety gear includes goggles, a lab coat, and gloves when using stains. The steps for this process are:

(1) Cut 1 cm from the tip of a growing root.
(2) If using ethano-orcein to stain, the tips also need to be fixed in ethanoic acid.
(3) Prepare a boiling tube with 1 M hydrochloric acid set in a water bath at 60°C, and incubate the root tip in it for about 5 minutes.
(4) Rinse the root tip well with cold water and leave it to dry.
(5) Place the tip on a microscope slide and cut 2 mm from the very tip. Discard the rest.
(6) Break the tip open and spread the cells thinly.
(7) Add a few drops of stain and leave it for a few minutes.
(8) If using Feulgen stain, an extra rinse is needed.
(9) Place a cover slip on top and squash the cells to thin the tissue enabling light passage.

Different stains are available, such as toluidine blue O, ethano-orcein, and Feulgen, each making chromosomes easier to see. Avoid smearing the cover slip to prevent damage. You can then observe cells in different stages of mitosis under an optical microscope.

You Can Observe Cells Using an Optical Microscope - Using an optical microscope involves the following steps:

(1) Clip the prepared slide onto the stage.
(2) Select the lowest-powered objective lens.
(3) Use the coarse adjustment knob to bring the stage close to the objective lens.
(4) Look down the eyepiece and adjust the stage position with the coarse knob to bring the image into rough focus.
(5) Use the fine adjustment knob for a clear image.
(6) For greater magnification, swap to a higher-powered lens and refocus.

It's important to note magnification and label drawings when recording mitotic cells. The Mitotic Index and its significance in determining tissue growth and abnormalities are discussed, with a formula provided for its calculation: mitotic index = (number of cells with visible chromosomes) / (total number of cells observed). A high mitotic index in plant root tips indicates active growth, whereas in other tissue samples, it may suggest tissue repair or cancerous growth."
17,"@@@Investigating Mitosis: Preparation and Observation Techniques
It's time to dust off your lab coat and get out your safety specs. Here are all the techniques you need to study mitosis. You'll need to know how to stain root cells on slides and how to use an optical microscope and graticules. Root Tips Can be Stained and Squashed to Observe Mitosis You need to know how to prepare and stain a root tip in order to observe the stages of mitosis. Make sure you're wearing safety goggles and a lab coat before you start. You should also wear gloves when using stains. 1) Cut 1 cm from the tip from a growing root (e.g. of an onion). It needs to be the tip because that's where growth occurs (and so that's where mitosis takes place). 2) If you're using ethano-orcein to stain the cells, the tips will also need to be fixed in ethanoic acid. 3) Prepare a boiling tube containing 1 M hydrochloric acid and put it in a water bath at 60 °C. Transfer the root tip into the boiling tube and incubate for about 5 minutes. 4) Use a pipette to rinse the root tip well with cold water. Leave the tip to dry on a paper towel. 5) Place the root tip on a microscope slide and cut 2 mm from the very tip of it. Get rid of the rest. 6) Use a mounted needle to break the tip open and spread the cells out thinly. 7) Add a few drops of stain and leave it for a few minutes. The stain will make the chromosomes easier to see under a microscope. There are loads of different stains, all with crazy names (toluidine blue O, ethano-orcein, Feulgen stain... 8) If you're using the Feulgen stain, you'll need an extra rinse. 9) Place a cover slip over the cells and push down firmly to squash the tissue. This will make the tissue thinner and allow light to pass through it. Don't smear the cover slip sideways (or you'll damage the chromosomes). Now you can look at all the stages of mitosis under an optical microscope (see below). You should see something that looks like the photograph on the right. Prophase Anaphase Metaphase Interphase HERVE CONGE. ISM/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY - You need to be able to recognise cells in the different stages of mitosis — see p. 32 for more info.

@@@Utilizing an Optical Microscope to Study Mitotic Cells
You Can Observe Cells Using an Optical Microscope You need to know how to use an optical microscope to observe your prepared root tip cells: 1) Start by clipping the slide you've prepared onto the stage. 2) Select the lowest-powered objective lens (i.e. the one that produces the lowest magnification). 3) Use the coarse adjustment knob to bring the stage up to just below the objective lens. 4) Look down the eyepiece (which contains the ocular lens). Use the coarse adjustment knob to move the stage downwards, away from the objective lens until the image is roughly in focus. 5) Adjust the focus with the fine adjustment knob, until you get a clear image of what's on the slide. 6) If you need to see the slide with greater magnification, swap to a higher-powered objective lens and refocus. If you're asked to draw cells undergoing mitosis under the microscope, make sure you write down the magnification the specimen was viewed under. You'll also need to label your drawing.

@@@Calculating the Mitotic Index
The Mitotic Index Is the Proportion of Cells Undergoing Mitosis You can calculate the mitotic index of your cells using this formula: mitotic index = number of cells with visible chromosomes / total number of cells observed This lets you work out how quickly the tissue is growing and if there's anything weird going on. A plant root tip is constantly growing, so you'd expect a high mitotic index (i.e. lots of cells in mitosis). In other tissue samples, a high mitotic index could mean that tissue repair is taking place or that there is cancerous growth in the tissue.

@@@Measuring Cell Size with Graticules and Micrometers
You Can Use A Graticule and Micrometer to Calculate the Size of Cells... 1) You need to be able to calculate the size of the cells you're looking at. That's where the eyepiece graticule and stage micrometer come in — they're a bit like rulers. 2) An eyepiece graticule is fitted onto the eyepiece. It's like a transparent ruler with numbers, but no units. 3) The stage micrometer is placed on the stage — it is a microscope slide with an accurate scale (it has units) and it's used to work out the value of the divisions on the eyepiece graticule at a particular magnification. 4) This means that when you take the stage micrometer away and replace it with the slide containing your tissue sample, you'll be able to measure the size of the cells. Here's an example: 4.5 eyepiece divisions = 1 stage division. Line up the eyepiece graticule and the stage micrometer. Each division on the stage micrometer is 0.1 mm long. At this magnification, 1 division on the stage micrometer is the same as 4.5 divisions on the eyepiece graticule. To work out the size of 1 division on the eyepiece graticule, you need to divide 0.1 by 4.5: 1 division on eyepiece graticule = 0.1 / 4.5 = 0.022 mm So if you look at a cell under the microscope at this magnification and it’s 4 eyepiece divisions long, you know it measures: 4 x 0.022 = 0.088 mm. The eyepiece graticule will need to be re-calibrated at different magnifications. If you're given an image of cells under the microscope in the exam, you can calculate their actual size using this formula: Example: If the image of a cell measures 5 mm and the magnification is x 100, then the actual size of the cell will be: 5 / 100 = 0.05 mm. actual size = size of image / magnification

@@@Understanding Microscopy Artefacts
Artefacts Can Get in the Way of Your Observations 1) Artefacts are things that you can see down the microscope that aren't part of the cell or specimen that you're looking at. 2) They can be anything from bits of dust, air bubbles and fingerprints, to inaccuracies caused by crushing and staining your sample. 3) Artefacts are usually made during the preparation of your slides and shouldn't really be there at all — you'll need to prepare your root tip cells carefully to avoid creating artefacts. Artefacts are especially common in electron micrographs because specimens need a lot of preparation before you can view them under an electron microscope. The first scientists to use these microscopes could only distinguish between artefacts and organelles by repeatedly preparing specimens in different ways. If an object could be seen with one preparation technique, but not another, it was more likely to be an artefact than an organelle.

@@@Practice Questions on Cell Division and Mitosis
Practice Questions Q1 Why do you need to squash the tissue when preparing a slide of plant root tip cells? Exam Question Q1 A sample of cells was prepared to observe mitosis. In total, 42 cells were observed. 32 of those had visible chromosomes. Calculate the mitotic index for this sample. Give your answer to 2 decimal places. [2 marks] ‘Staining your samples’ — a common problem at the start of exams... Wow — I bet you never realised there was so much to know about using a microscope. Still, staining is pretty straightforward and so's preparing a slide. Using a graticule is tricky, but once you get your head round it you'll be fine."
18,"@@@Introduction to Cell Membrane Structure
You might remember a bit about cell membranes from p. 25. Well now it's time to delve a little deeper into their structure and functionality. All cells are surrounded by cell membranes, and in eukaryotic cells, many of the organelles are also enclosed by membranes.

@@@Functions of the Cell Membrane
Cell-surface membranes serve as barriers between the cell and its external environment, controlling which substances can enter and leave the cell. They are selectively permeable, allowing some molecules to pass through by diffusion, osmosis, or active transport, while restricting others. Similarly, membranes around organelles segregate the cell into different compartments, maintaining a boundary between the organelle and the cytoplasm, and controlling substance exchange within the cell.

@@@Structure of Cell Membranes: The Fluid Mosaic Model
The basic structure of cell membranes, primarily composed of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates, is consistent across all cell types. The fluid mosaic model proposed in 1972 is a widely accepted description of the membrane's organization, where the phospholipid molecules form a double layer that is fluid due to constant movement amongst the molecules. Embedded within this bilayer are cholesterol molecules, various proteins—including channel and carrier proteins that facilitate transport, and receptor proteins for cell signaling—and glycoproteins which aid in cell recognition and interaction.

@@@Functional Roles of Membrane Components
Each component of the cell membrane serves a unique purpose. Phospholipids organize into a bilayer with hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails, forming a barrier to water-soluble substances. Cholesterol, another lipid component, contributes to membrane stability by fitting snugly between phospholipid molecules, making the membrane less fluid and more structured. This stability is especially critical in animal cells, which lack supporting cell walls.

@@@Investigating Membrane Permeability in the Laboratory
The permeability of cell membranes is influenced by environmental factors like temperature and solvent concentration. A laboratory method to examine this involves using beetroot pieces, where pigment leakage indicates membrane permeability. By varying the temperature or solvent exposure, one can monitor the color intensity in the solution to gauge the permeability changes.

@@@The Influence of Temperature on Membrane Permeability
Membrane permeability is temperature-dependent. Below 0 °C, phospholipids are closely packed, rendering the membrane rigid. However, this also leads to deformation of proteins within the membrane, increasing permeability. Between 0 and 45 °C, the membrane is semi-permeable, with increasing temperature causing phospholipids to move more, thereby increasing permeability. Above 45 °C, the bilayer begins to break down, pressure builds within the cell, and proteins deform, dramatically increasing membrane permeability.

@@@Examining the Fluid Mosaic Model
The fluid mosaic model is an interesting concept that describes the dynamic nature of cell membranes. This model is crucial because it explains the cell's capacity to alter shape and adapt without bursting due to rigidity. The membrane's fluidity is fundamental to the cell's mechanical stability and functionality."
19,"@@@Exchange Across Cell Membranes — Diffusion: Understanding the Passive Movement of Particles
Exchange Across Cell Membranes through Diffusion begins to unravel the seemingly complex process of how some substances cross cell membranes without expending energy—an excitement for those keen on cellular processes. A depth exploration of diffusion, the passive movement of particles, unfolds thusly:
1) Diffusion is the process where particles (molecules or ions) move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration naturally, aiming to reach an equilibrium.
2) Molecules move in both directions, but there is a net movement towards the area of lower concentration, which continues until an even distribution is achieved within the liquid or gas.
3) This movement path—from higher to lower concentration—is termed the concentration gradient. Movement along this gradient is known as traveling ""down"" the concentration gradient.
4) Diffusion is passive, requiring no energy to occur.
5) For particles to diffuse across cell membranes, they must freely traverse the membrane.

The ability of molecules to pass through the cell membrane depends on their characteristics. Polar molecules, with partial positive and negative charges, differ from non-polar molecules that do not carry the same charge distinctions. For example, molecules like oxygen and carbon dioxide can diffuse with ease through cell membranes because of their petite size, allowing passage between phospholipids, and their non-polar nature, enabling them to dissolve in the hydrophobic bilayer.

@@@Facilitated Diffusion: The Role of Carrier Proteins and Protein Channels in Membrane Transport
Sometimes, molecules require assistance to diffuse expeditiously across cell membranes. This section elucidates Facilitated Diffusion, the diffusion process for large or charged particles.
1) Large molecules, such as amino acids and glucose, would move sluggishly through the phospholipid bilayer due to their size.
2) Charged particles, including ions and polar molecules, would also diffuse at a slow pace given their water solubility and the bilayer's hydrophobic center.
3) Thus, to expedite the process, these larger or charged particles diffuse through carrier proteins or channel proteins present in the membrane, a process known as facilitated diffusion.
4) Facilitated diffusion, mirroring diffusion, moves particles down a concentration gradient without energy usage.

Carrier proteins work by attaching to a large molecule first, then altering their shape to release the molecule to the other side of the membrane, obeying the concentration gradient.

Channel proteins provide another facilitated diffusion pathway, creating pores in the membrane for charged particles to diffuse through, based on their concentration gradient, with each protein catering to different charged particles.

@@@The Rate of Diffusion: Factors Influencing Particle Movement Across Cell Membranes
This section examines the factors impacting the rate of diffusion, from concentration gradients to membrane adaptions for rapid transport.
1) The concentration gradient significantly affects the rate of diffusion; the higher it is, the quicker diffusion occurs, though the rate decreases as equilibrium gets closer.
2) The exchange surface's thinness is also critical—the thinner it is, the more rapid the diffusion, as the distance traveled by the particles is reduced.
3) A larger surface area, such as that of the cell-surface membrane, provides a faster diffusion rate.

Microvilli, for example, increase the surface area available for diffusion, as seen in epithelial cells within the small intestine. These microvilli can substantially increase a cell's surface area, thus boosting the diffusion rate.

To distinguish, simple diffusion relies on the concentration gradient, while facilitated diffusion not only relies on it but also on the availability and quantity of channel or carrier proteins present. The presence of more proteins equates to a faster facilitated diffusion rate. Special channel proteins like aquaporins illustrate the function by enabling water to diffuse through cell membranes efficiently.

Testing knowledge on diffusion can appear in exams where one might be asked to calculate diffusion rates from graphs, which could involve finding a line's gradient or drawing tangents.

@@@Practice and Exam Questions on Diffusion and Rate Factors
Finally, to solidify understanding, a set of practice questions challenges the learner's comprehension of passive diffusion and the role of microvilli. Additionally, an exam question calls for detailed knowledge involving facilitated diffusion of chloride ions, including the molecules involved, why simple diffusion is inefficient, and the implications over time. Through these inquiries, students get to delve deeper into the workings of molecules that endlessly move without growing weary, painting a picture of cellular functionality where small molecules like oxygen resort to simple diffusion, and large or charged molecules get a boost from channel or carrier proteins. All the while, this sets the stage for the upcoming topic of active transport."
20,"@@@Understanding Osmosis: The Diffusion of Water Molecules Across Cell Membranes
These two pages are entirely about the movement of water molecules. If you've mastered diffusion (see pages 38-39), you'll nail this lot in no time. Osmosis is Diffusion of Water Molecules. Osmosis is the diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane, from an area of higher water potential (i.e., higher concentration of water molecules) to an area of lower water potential (i.e., lower concentration of water molecules). Water potential is the potential (likelihood) of water molecules to diffuse out of or into a solution. Pure water has the highest water potential. All solutions have a lower water potential than pure water. If two solutions have the same water potential, they're said to be isotonic. LOWER water potential net movement of water molecules. OUT. IN Higher water potential water molecules diffuse both ways membrane. Water molecule. The Rate of Osmosis Depends on Several Factors. The factors affecting the rate of osmosis are similar to those affecting the rate of diffusion (see previous page). 

1) The water potential gradient — the higher the water potential gradient, the faster the rate of osmosis. As osmosis takes place, the difference in water potential on either side of the membrane decreases, so the rate of osmosis levels off over time.

2) The thickness of the exchange surface — the thinner the exchange surface, the faster the rate of osmosis. 

3) The surface area of the exchange surface — the larger the surface area, the faster the rate of osmosis.

@@@Osmosis: Practical Experiments and Water Potential Insights
You can do Experiments to Investigate Water Potential using Serial Dilutions. You can do a simple experiment, using potato cylinders, to find out the water potential of plant tissue (see next page). First though, you need to make up several solutions of different, known concentrations to test the cylinders in. You can do this using a serial dilution technique: 

This is how you'd make five serial dilutions of a sucrose solution, starting with an initial sucrose concentration of 2 M and diluting each solution by a factor of 2... Line up five test tubes in a rack. You don't have to dilute solutions by a factor of 2. For example, to dilute by a factor of 10, take 1 cm3 from your original sample and add it to 9 cm3 of water. Transfer 5 cm3. Add 10 cm3 of the initial 2 M sucrose solution to the first test tube and 5 cm3 of distilled water to the other four test tubes. Then, using a pipette, draw 5 cm3 of the solution from the first test tube, add it to the distilled water in the second test tube and mix the solution thoroughly. You now have 10 cm3 of solution that's half as concentrated as the solution in the first test tube (it's 1 M). Repeat this process three more times to create solutions of 0.5 M, 0.25 M, and 0.125 M. 

@@@Advanced Techniques in Osmosis: Using Scale Factors to Prepare Solutions
You Can Also Make Solutions of Different Concentrations By Finding the Scale Factor. You can make sucrose solutions of any concentration by finding the scale factor. For example, if you want to make 15 cm3 of 0.4 M sucrose solution...

1) Start with a solution of a known concentration, e.g. 1 M. 

2) Find the scale factor by dividing the concentration of this solution by the concentration of the solution you want to make. So in this case, the scale factor = 1 M / 0.4 M = 2.5. 

3) This means that the solution you want to make is 2.5 times weaker than the one you have. To make the solution 2.5 times weaker, use 2.5 times less of it, i.e., 15 cm3 / 2.5 = 6 cm3. Transfer this amount to a clean test tube. 

4) Top up the test tube with distilled water to get the volume you want to make. In this case, you want to make 15 cm3 of solution, so you need to add: 15 - 6 = 9 cm3 of distilled water.

@@@Determining Water Potential in Potatoes Through Osmotic Experiments
Use Your Solutions To Find the Water Potential of Potato Cells. 

1) Use a cork borer to cut potatoes into identically sized chips, about 1 cm in diameter. 

2) Divide the chips into groups of three and measure the mass of each group using a mass balance. 

3) Place one group into each of your sucrose solutions. 

4) Leave the chips in the solutions for at least 20 minutes (making sure that they all get the same amount of time). 

5) Remove the chips and pat dry gently with a paper towel. 

6) Weigh each group again and record your results. 

7) Calculate the % change in mass for each group. 

8) Use the results to make a calibration curve, showing % change in mass against sucrose concentration. The potato chips will gain water (and therefore mass) in solutions with a higher water potential than the chips, and lose water in solutions with a lower water potential. The point at which the curve crosses the x-axis (where the % change in mass is 0) is the point at which the water potential of the sucrose solution is the same as the water potential of the potato cells. Find the concentration at this point, then look up the water potential for that concentration of sucrose solution in, e.g., a textbook.

I always knew that glass of water had potential... Osmosis is just a fancy name for the diffusion of water molecules. But whether water moves in or out of a cell depends on the water potential of the surrounding solution. Water potential can be pretty confusing — if you can't make head nor tail of an exam question about it try replacing the word 'potential' with 'concentration' and it'll become clearer."
21,"@@@Introduction to Enzyme Activity and Factors Influencing It
Now you know what enzymes are and how they work, let's take a look at what makes them tick. Humans need things like money and the newest mobile phone, but enzymes are quite content with the right temperature and pH.

@@@Temperature's Influence on Enzyme Activity
Temperature has a Big Influence on Enzyme Activity. Like any chemical reaction, the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction increases when the temperature's increased. More heat means more kinetic energy, so molecules move faster. This makes the enzymes more likely to collide with the substrate molecules. The energy of these collisions also increases, which means each collision is more likely to result in a reaction. But, if the temperature gets too high, the reaction stops. 
1) The rise in temperature makes the enzyme's molecules vibrate more. 
2) If the temperature goes above a certain level, this vibration breaks some of the bonds that hold the enzyme in shape. 
3) The active site changes shape and the enzyme and substrate no longer fit together. 
4) At this point, the enzyme is denatured— it no longer functions as a catalyst. 
optimum temperature 
Temperature

@@@pH Influence on Enzyme Activity
pH Also Affects Enzyme Activity. Every enzyme has an optimum temperature. For most human enzymes, it's around 37°C but some enzymes, like those used in biological washing powders, can work well at 60 °C. All enzymes have an optimum pH value. Most human enzymes work best at pH 7 (neutral), but there are exceptions. Pepsin, for example, works best at acidic pH 2, which is useful because it's found in the stomach. Above and below the optimum pH, the H+ and OH- ions found in acids and alkalis can mess up the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds that hold the enzyme's tertiary structure in place. This makes the active site change shape, so the enzyme is denatured.

@@@Effect of Enzyme Concentration on Reaction Rate
Enzyme Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction. 
1) The more enzyme molecules there are in a solution, the more likely a substrate molecule is to collide with one and form an enzyme-substrate complex. So increasing the concentration of the enzyme increases the rate of reaction. 
2) But, if the amount of substrate is limited, there comes a point when there's more than enough enzyme molecules to deal with all the available substrate, so adding more enzyme has no further effect.

@@@Impact of Substrate Concentration on The Rate of Reaction
Substrate Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction Up to a Point. 
1) The higher the substrate concentration, the faster the reaction—more substrate molecules means a collision between substrate and enzyme is more likely and so more active sites will be used. This is only true up until a 'saturation' point though. After that, there are so many substrate molecules that the enzymes have about as much as they can cope with (all the active sites are full), and adding more makes no difference. 
2) Substrate concentration decreases with time during a reaction (unless more substrate is added to the reaction mixture), so if no other variables are changed, the rate of reaction will decrease over time too. This makes the initial rate of reaction (the reaction rate at the start) the highest rate of reaction.

@@@Enzyme Inhibition Mechanisms
Enzyme Activity can be Inhibited. Enzyme activity can be prevented by enzyme inhibitors. Inhibition can be competitive or non-competitive.

COMPETITIVE INHIBITION molecules that bind to the enzyme that they inhibit. 
1) Competitive inhibitor molecules have a similar shape to that of the substrate molecules. 
2) They compete with the substrate molecules to bind to the active site, but no reaction takes place. 
3) Instead they block the active site, so no substrate molecules can fit in it. 
4) How much the enzyme is inhibited depends on the relative concentrations of the inhibitor and the substrate. 
5) If there's a high concentration of the inhibitor, it'll take up nearly all the active sites and hardly any of the substrate wil get to the enzyme. 
6) But if there's a higher concentration of substrate, then the substrate's chances of getting to an active site before the inhibitor increase. So increasing the concentration of substrate will increase the rate of reaction (up to a point).

NON-COMPETITIVE INHIBITION 
1) Non-competitive inhibitor molecules bind to the enzyme away from its active site. 
2) This causes the active site to change shape so the substrate molecules can no longer bind to it. 
3) They don't 'compete' with the substrate molecules to bind to the active site because they are a different shape. 
4) Increasing the concentration of substrate won't make any difference to the reaction rate—enzyme activity will still be inhibited.

@@@Practical Application and Understanding Enzyme Inhibition

Activity — mine is usually inhibited by pizza and a movie... Human enzymes work well under normal body conditions—a neutral pH and body temp of 37 °C. Many poisons are enzyme inhibitors, e.g. cyanide. Even though there are thousands of enzymes in our bodies, inhibiting just one of them can cause severe problems. Some drugs are enzyme inhibitors though, e.g. penicillin, so they're not all bad."
22,"@@@The Immune System Overview

An infectious disease is one that is caused by pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Infectious diseases can be really nasty, but luckily there's an army of cells in the body that helps to protect us — the immune system. 

@@@Foreign Antigens Trigger an Immune Response

Antigens are molecules (usually proteins) that can generate an immune response when detected by the body. They are usually found on the surface of cells and are used by the immune system to identify pathogens (organisms that cause disease), abnormal body cells (e.g., cancerous or pathogen-infected cells, which have abnormal antigens on their surface), toxins, and cells from other individuals of the same species (e.g., organ transplants).

@@@Phagocytes Engulf Pathogens as the First Stage of the Immune Response

There are four main stages in the immune response: The first stage of the immune response involves phagocytes, which are a type of white blood cell that carries out phagocytosis (engulfment of pathogens). They're found in the blood and in tissues and are the first cells to respond to an immune system trigger inside the body. The process includes the phagocyte recognizing foreign antigens on a pathogen, engulfing it, containing it in a phagocytic vacuole, and then a lysosome fusing with this vacuole to break down the pathogen using lysozymes. Afterward, the phagocyte presents the pathogen's antigens on its surface to activate other immune system cells.

@@@Phagocytes Activate T-cells as the Second Stage of the Immune Response

The next stage involves the activation of T-cells by phagocytes. A T-cell (also called a T-lymphocyte) with receptor proteins on its surface binds to complementary antigens presented by phagocytes. This activation of the T-cell leads to different responses by different types of T-cells, for example, helper T-cells (TH cells) release chemical signals that activate phagocytes and cytotoxic T-cells (Tc cells) which kill abnormal and foreign cells, as well as B-cells, which secrete antibodies.

@@@T-cells Activate B-cells, Leading to Clonal Selection

The third stage is the activation of B-cells by T-cells, which divide into plasma cells. B-cells (B-lymphocytes) are covered with antibodies that bind antigens to form an antigen-antibody complex. The antibody on the surface of a B-cell binds to a complementary shaped antigen, and with substances released from helper T-cells, the B-cell is activated in clonal selection and divided into plasma cells.

@@@Plasma Cells Produce Specific Antibodies as the Final Stage of the Immune Response

The fourth stage involves plasma cells, which are identical to the B-cell and secrete antibodies specific to the antigen. These antibodies can bind to pathogens resulting in agglutination where pathogens clump together, enabling phagocytes to phagocytose many pathogens at once. The destruction of pathogens carrying the antigen is thus facilitated in the body. Antibody specificity is based on the variable regions with unique tertiary structures complementary to specific antigens, and the constant regions are identical in all antibodies.

@@@The Immune Response Subdivisions and Memory Formation

The immune response is split into two subdivisions: the cellular response involving T-cells and other cells, and the humoral response involving B-cells, clonal selection, and monoclonal antibody production. Both types of response remove pathogens and interact with each other, as T-cells help to activate B-cells, and antibodies make it easier for phagocytes to engulf pathogens. Memory cells are produced following exposure to an antigen which allows the body to quickly respond to a second infection, producing a quicker and stronger response, which is known as the secondary immune response. Memory cells remain in the body for a long time, with memory T-cells remembering the antigen and memory B-cells recording the antibodies needed."
23,"@@@Understanding Immunity and the Role of Vaccines

Immunity and vaccines play crucial roles in protecting individuals and populations from diseases. The primary response grants immunity against a disease but only after an infection has occurred. Vaccination provides a method to stimulate memory cell production without actually contracting the disease. Vaccines contain antigens that induce the body to produce memory cells against a pathogen without causing disease symptoms, resulting in immunity without sickness. Individuals who are vaccinated are protected, and herd immunity is established, decreasing the likelihood of disease spread, even to those who are not vaccinated. Vaccines may contain free antigens or ones attached to dead or weakened pathogens and can be administered through injection or oral intake. Booster vaccines may be required to ensure ongoing production of memory cells.

@@@The Challenge of Antigenic Variation in Pathogen Evasion

Not all pathogens are easily thwarted by the immune system. Antigenic variation occurs when pathogens alter their surface antigens, enabling them to evade the immune response even upon subsequent infections. This genetic change in pathogens such as HIV and influenza virus complicates vaccine development, as memory cells from a previous infection will not recognize newly altered antigens. The flu vaccine exemplifies this, as it must be updated annually to combat new strains of the virus that arise due to antigenic variation, with health authorities working to select and distribute the most effective vaccine each year. This dynamic challenge requires adaptive strategies to provide protection against evolving pathogens.

@@@Active and Passive Immunity: Types and Characteristics

Immunity can be categorized into active and passive forms. Active immunity, where the immune system produces its own antibodies in response to an antigen, can be natural, following an infection, or artificial, resulting from vaccination. Passive immunity involves the transfer of antibodies from another organism, and can also be natural, such as maternal antibodies, or artificial, through antibody injections like those used in response to tetanus. The differences between these types of immunity are significant. Active immunity leads to memory cell production and long-term protection, while passive immunity provides immediate but temporary protection without memory cell formation.

@@@Practical Understanding and Examination of Immunity Concepts

The study of immunity encompasses both practical understanding and theoretical knowledge, often assessed in exams. Students may encounter questions about the mechanics of vaccines, the concept of antigenic variability, and the distinctions between active and passive immunity. Exam questions might explore the effectiveness of vaccination programs, the recurring nature of diseases like influenza, and the timing and duration of immune protection afforded by different types of immunity. These questions help solidify understanding of immunological principles and their applications in medical science."
24,"@@@ Antibodies in Medicine: Their Crucial Role in Health and Disease
Antibodies aren't only great for fighting off infection, they're also excellent tools for use in medical diagnosis and drug development. Let's all give three cheers for antibodies. Without them, we'd all probably be dead by now.

@@@ Monoclonal Antibodies: Precision Tools for Targeted Therapy
Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies produced from a single group of genetically identical B-cells (plasma cells). This means that they're all identical in structure. As you know, antibodies are very specific because their binding sites have a unique tertiary structure (see p.44) that only one particular antigen will fit into (one with a complementary shape). You can make monoclonal antibodies that bind to anything you want, e.g., a cell antigen or other substance, and they will only bind to (target) this molecule.

EXAMPLE: Targeting Drugs to Cancer Cells
1) Different cells in the body have different surface antigens.
2) Cancer cells have antigens called tumor markers that are not found on normal body cells.
3) Monoclonal antibodies can be made that will bind to the tumor markers.
4) You can also attach anti-cancer drugs to the antibodies.
5) When the antibodies come into contact with the cancer cells they will bind to the tumor markers.
6) This means the drug will only accumulate in the body where there are cancer cells.
7) So, the side effects of an antibody-based drug are lower than other drugs because they accumulate near specific cells.

EXAMPLE: Medical Diagnosis Through Pregnancy Testing
Pregnancy tests detect the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) that's found in the urine of pregnant women:
1) The application area contains antibodies for hCG bound to a colored bead (blue).
2) When urine is applied to the application area any hCG will bind to the antibody on the beads, forming an antigen-antibody complex.
3) The urine moves up the stick to the test strip, carrying any beads with it.
4) The test strip contains antibodies to hCG that are stuck in place (immobilized).
5) If there is hCG present the test strip turns blue because the immobilized antibody binds to any hCG — concentrating the hCG-antibody complex with the blue beads attached.
If no hCG is present, the beads will pass through the test area without binding to anything, and so it won't go blue.

@@@ The ELISA Test: A Versatile Method for Medical Diagnosis Using Antibodies
The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) allows you to see if a patient has any antibodies to a certain antigen (see example below) or any antigen to a certain antibody. It can be used to test for pathogenic infections, for allergies (e.g. to nuts or lactose), and for just about anything you can make an antibody for. In an ELISA test, an antibody is used which has an enzyme attached to it. This enzyme can react with a substrate to produce a colored product. This causes the solution in the reaction vessel to change color. If there's a color change, it demonstrates that the antigen or antibody of interest is present in the sample being tested (e.g., blood plasma). In some types of ELISA, the quantity of this antigen/antibody can be worked out from the intensity of the color change. 

There are several different types of ELISA:
- Direct ELISA uses a single antibody that is complementary to the antigen you're testing for.
- Indirect ELISA uses two different antibodies. This method is outlined below:

EXAMPLE: Using an ELISA as an HIV Test
An indirect ELISA test can be used to see if a patient possesses antibodies to the HIV virus:
1) HIV antigen is bound to the bottom of a well in a well plate (a plastic tray with loads of little circular pits in it).
2) A sample of the patient's blood plasma, which might contain several different antibodies, is added to the well.
3) If there are any HIV-specific antibodies (i.e., antibodies against HIV), these will bind to the HIV antigen stuck to the bottom of the well.
4) The well is then washed out to remove any unbound antibodies.
5) A secondary antibody, that has a specific enzyme attached to it, is added to the well.
6) This secondary antibody can bind to the HIV-specific antibody (which is also called the primary antibody). 
7) The well is washed out again to remove any unbound secondary antibody. If there's no primary antibody in the sample, all of the secondary antibody will be washed away.
8) A solution is added to the well. This solution contains a substrate, which is able to react with the enzyme attached to the secondary antibody and produce a colored product.
9) If the solution changes color, it indicates that the patient has HIV-specific antibodies in their blood and is infected with HIV.

The washing steps are important to make sure unbound antibodies aren't left in the well, which could affect the results. For instance, unbound secondary antibodies could cause the test to appear positive when there are no HIV antibodies present. If the result was negative, there would be no color change because there would be no HIV-specific antibodies for the secondary antibody to bind to.

@@@ Practice Questions: Testing Your Understanding of Antibodies
Q1: What are monoclonal antibodies?
Exam Question: Describe how monoclonal antibodies can be used to target a drug to cancer cells. [4 marks]
Antibodies — the multi-tool of the immune system... Monoclonal antibodies are really useful — they can even be made against other antibodies. For example, people with asthma produce too many of a type of antibody that causes inflammation in the lungs. Monoclonal antibodies can be made to bind this type of antibody, so it can no longer cause inflammation, which can reduce the asthma symptoms."
25,"@@@Introduction to Lipids
Lipids are really nice. Without them, we'd have no cell membranes. You owe it to them to make sure you can remember all of the stuff about them on these pages. It'll help you and your membranes get a good grade.

@@@Triglycerides and Their Structure
Triglycerides are a kind of lipid, having one molecule of glycerol with three fatty acids attached to it. Fatty acid molecules have long tails made of hydrocarbons. The tails are 'hydrophobic' (they repel water molecules), making lipids insoluble in water. All fatty acids have the same basic structure, with a carbon atom linking the fatty acid to the glycerol, an 'R' group which is the variable hydrocarbon tail, and the carboxyl group ('COOH') bonded to the rest of the molecule.

@@@Formation of Triglycerides Through Condensation Reactions
Triglycerides are formed through a process where fatty acids join to a glycerol molecule. When a fatty acid attaches to glycerol, an ester bond is formed, and a molecule of water is released—a condensation reaction. This process is repeated two more times to form a complete triglyceride, where each of the three fatty acids is linked to the glycerol backbone.

@@@Variations in Fatty Acids: Saturated vs. Unsaturated
Fatty acids can be classified as saturated or unsaturated, depending on the presence of double bonds within their hydrocarbon tails. Saturated fatty acids do not contain any double bonds between their carbon atoms, while unsaturated fatty acids have at least one double bond, causing the chain to kink.

@@@Phospholipids and Their Role in Cell Membranes
Phospholipids, which are the primary lipids found in cell membranes, share similarities with triglycerides. However, they have one significant difference: one of the fatty acid molecules in a phospholipid is replaced by a phosphate group. The phosphate group is hydrophilic (attracts water), contrasting with the hydrophobic nature (repel water) of the fatty acid tails. This dual nature is crucial for the structure and function of the cell membrane.

26,"@@@HIV and Viruses: Basic Concepts and Impact on the Immune System

Viruses aren't cells like bacteria. They're not even living things—they can only reproduce inside the cells of another organism (called the host). All viruses cause disease, and you need to know all about one particularly nasty blighter...HIV is the Virus That Causes AIDS. 1) HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that affects the immune system. It eventually leads to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). 2) AIDS is a condition where the immune system deteriorates and eventually fails. This makes someone with AIDS more vulnerable to other infections, like pneumonia (see next page). 3) HIV infects (and eventually kills) helper T-cells, which act as the host cells (see p. 28) for the virus. Remember, helper T-cells send chemical signals that activate phagocytes, cytotoxic T-cells and B-cells (see p. 44) so they're hugely important cells in the immune response. Without enough helper T-cells, the immune system is unable to mount an effective response to infections because other immune system cells don't behave how they should. 4) People infected with HIV develop AIDS when the helper T-cell numbers in their body reach a critically low level.

@@@The Structure of HIV

HIV has a Spherical Structure. You might get asked about the structure of HIV in your exam. 1) A core that contains the genetic material (RNA) and some proteins (including the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is needed for virus replication). 2) An outer coating of protein called a capsid. 3) An extra outer layer called an envelope. This is made of membrane stolen from the cell membrane of a previous host cell. 4) Sticking out from the envelope are loads of copies of an attachment protein that help HIV attach to the host helper T-cell.

@@@HIV Replication Process

HIV Replicates Inside its Host’s Helper T-Cells. HIV (and all other viruses) can only reproduce inside the cells of the organism it has infected. HIV replicates inside the helper T-cells of the host. It doesn't have the equipment (such as enzymes and ribosomes) to replicate on its own, so it uses those of the host cell. Here's how HIV replicates: 1) The attachment protein attaches to a receptor molecule on the cell membrane of the host helper T-cell. 2) The capsid is released into the cell, where it uncoats and releases the genetic material (RNA) into the cell's cytoplasm. 3) Inside the cell, reverse transcriptase is used to make a complementary strand of DNA from the viral RNA template (see p. 16-17 for more on DNA and RNA). 4) From this, double-stranded DNA is made and inserted into the human DNA. 5) Host cell enzymes are used to make viral proteins from the viral DNA found within the human DNA. 6) The viral proteins are assembled into new viruses, which bud from the cell and go on to infect other cells. During the initial infection period, HIV replicates rapidly and the infected person may experience severe flu-like symptoms. After this period, HIV replication drops to a lower level. This is the latency period. During the latency period (which can last for years), the infected person won't experience any symptoms.

@@@Clinical Progression and Illnesses Associated with AIDS

People with AIDS are Susceptible to a Range of Illnesses. People with HIV are classed as having AIDS when symptoms of their failing immune system start to appear or their helper T-cell count drops below a certain level. People with AIDS generally develop diseases that wouldn't cause serious problems in people with a healthy immune system. The length of time between infection with HIV and the development of AIDS varies between individuals but without treatment it's usually around 10 years. 1) The initial symptoms of AIDS include minor infections of mucous membranes (e.g. the inside of the nose, ears and genitals), and recurring respiratory infections. 2) As AIDS progresses the number of immune system cells decreases further. Patients become susceptible to more serious infections including chronic diarrhoea, severe bacterial infections and tuberculosis. 3) During the late stages of AIDS patients have a very low number of immune system cells and can develop a range of serious infections such as toxoplasmosis of the brain (a parasite infection) and candidiasis of the respiratory system (fungal infection). It's these serious infections that kill AIDS patients, not HIV itself. The length of time that people survive with AIDS varies a lot. Factors that affect progression of HIV to AIDS and survival time with AIDS include existing infections, the strain of HIV they're infected with, age and access to healthcare.

@@@Why Antibiotics Are Ineffective Against HIV and Treatment Strategies

Antibiotics Don’t Work Against Viruses. 1) Antibiotics kill bacteria by interfering with their metabolic reactions. They target the bacterial enzymes and ribosomes used in these reactions. 2) Bacterial enzymes and ribosomes are different from human enzymes and ribosomes. Antibiotics are designed to only target the bacterial ones so they don't damage human cells. Makes sense. 3) Viruses don't have their own enzymes and ribosomes—they use the ones in the host's cells. So because human viruses use human enzymes and ribosomes to replicate, antibiotics can't inhibit them because they don't target human processes. 4) Most antiviral drugs are designed to target the few virus-specific enzymes (enzymes that only the virus uses) that exist. For example, HIV uses reverse transcriptase to replicate (see previous page). Human cells don't use this enzyme so drugs can be designed to inhibit it without affecting the host cell. These drugs are called reverse-transcriptase inhibitors.

There’s No Cure for HIV. 1) There's currently no cure or vaccine for HIV but antiviral drugs can be used to slow down the progression of HIV infection and AIDS in an infected person. 2) The best way to control HIV infection in a population is by reducing its spread. HIV can be spread via unprotected sexual intercourse, through infected bodily fluids (e.g. like blood from sharing contaminated needles) and from a HIV-positive mother to her fetus.

27,"@@@Exchange and Transport Systems: Understanding the Importance of Size and Surface Area

Exchanging things with the environment is pretty easy if you're a single-celled organism, but if you're multicellular it all gets a bit more complicated... and it's all down to this 'surface area to volume ratio' malarkey. Every organism, whatever its size, needs to exchange things with its environment. Otherwise there'd be no such thing as poop scoops...

1) Cells need to take in oxygen (for aerobic respiration) and nutrients.
2) They also need to excrete waste products like carbon dioxide and urea.
3) Most organisms need to stay at roughly the same temperature, so heat needs to be exchanged too.

How easy the exchange of substances is depends on the organism's surface area to volume ratio.

@@@The Science Behind Surface Area to Volume Ratios in Different Animals

A mouse has a bigger surface area relative to its volume than a hippo. This can be hard to imagine, but you can prove it mathematically. Imagine these animals as cubes:

The hippo could be represented by a block measuring 2 cm x 4 cm x 4 cm. Its volume is 2 x 4 x 4 = 32 cm3. Its surface area is 2 x 4 x 4 = 32 cm2 (top and bottom surfaces of cube) + 4x2x4 = 32 cm2 (four sides of the cube). Total surface area = 64 cm2. So the hippo has a surface area: volume ratio of 64:32 or 2:1. Compare this to a cube mouse measuring 1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm. Its volume is 1 x 1 x 1 = 1 cm3. Its surfacc area is 6 x 1 x 1 = 6 cm2. So the mouse has a surface area: volume ratio of 6:1. The cube mouse's surface area is six times its volume, but the cube hippo's surface area is only twice its volume. Smaller animals have a bigger surface compared to their volume.

@@@Why Multicellular Organisms Rely on Exchange Organs and Mass Transport Systems

An organism needs to supply every one of its cells with substances like glucose and oxygen (for respiration). It also needs to remove waste products from every cell to avoid damaging itself.

1) In single-celled organisms, these substances can diffuse directly into (or out of) the cell across the cell-surface membrane. The diffusion rate is quick because of the small distances the substances have to travel.
2) In multicellular animals, diffusion across the outer membrane is too slow, for two reasons: Some cells are deep within the body — there's a big distance between them and the outside environment. Larger animals have a low surface area to volume ratio — it's difficult to exchange enough substances to supply a large volume of animal through a relatively small outer surface.

So rather than using straightforward diffusion to absorb and excrete substances, multicellular animals need specialised exchange organs (like lungs). They also need an efficient system to carry substances to and from their individual cells — this is mass transport. In mammals, 'mass transport' normally refers to the circulatory system, which uses blood to carry glucose and oxygen around the body. It also carries hormones, antibodies and waste like CO2. Mass transport in plants involves the transport of water and solutes in the xylem and phloem.

@@@How Body Size and Shape Influence Heat Exchange in Organisms

As well as creating waste products that need to be transported away, the metabolic activity inside cells creates heat. Staying at the right temperature is difficult, and it's pretty heavily influenced by your size and shape...

Size: The rate of heat loss from an organism depends on its surface area. If an organism has a large volume, e.g. a hippo, its surface area is relatively small. This makes it harder for it to lose heat from its body. If an organism is small, e.g. a mouse, its relative surface area is large, so heat is lost more easily. This means smaller organisms need a relatively high metabolic rate, in order to generate enough heat to stay warm.

Shape: 
1) Animals with a compact shape have a small surface area relative to their volume—minimising heat loss from their surface.
2) Animals with a less compact shape (those that are a bit gangly or have sticky outy bits) have a larger surface area relative to their volume—this increases heat loss from their surface.
3) Whether an animal is compact or not depends on the temperature of its environment. Here's an example:
- Arctic fox has small ears and a round head to reduce its SA:V ratio and heat loss.
- African bat-eared fox has large ears and a more pointed nose to increase its SA:V ratio and heat loss.
- European fox is intermediate between the two, matching the temperature of its environment.

@@@Adaptation Strategies of Organisms for Efficient Exchange

Not all organisms have a body size or shape to suit their climate—some have other adaptations instead...
1) Animals with a high SA:volume ratio tend to lose more water as it evaporates from their surface. Some small desert mammals have kidney structure adaptations so that they produce less urine to compensate.
2) To support their high metabolic rates, small mammals living in cold regions need to eat large amounts of high energy foods such as seeds and nuts.
3) Smaller mammals may have thick layers of fur or hibernate when the weather gets really cold.
4) Larger organisms living in hot regions, e.g. elephants and hippos, find it hard to keep cool as their heat loss is relatively slow. Elephants have developed large flat ears to increase their surface area, allowing them to lose more heat. Hippos spend much of the day in the water—a behavioural adaptation to help them lose heat."
28,"@@@Introduction to Gas Exchange in Humans
In humans, gas exchange takes place in the lungs. You need to know the structure of the lungs as well as how they're ventilated... take a deep breath... Lungs are Specialised Organs for Gas Exchange. Humans need to get oxygen into the blood (for respiration) and they need to get rid of carbon dioxide (made by respiring cells). This is where breathing (or ventilation as it's sometimes called) and the gas exchange system comes in.

@@@Human Gas Exchange System
Human Gas Exchange System includes intercostal muscles, bronchus, bronchiole, alveoli. The process starts when you breathe in, as air enters the trachea (windpipe). The trachea splits into two bronchi — one bronchus leading to each lung. Each bronchus then branches off into smaller tubes called bronchioles. The bronchioles end in small 'air sacs' called alveoli (this is where gases are exchanged — see next page). The ribcage, intercostal muscles, and diaphragm all work together to move air in and out. There are actually three layers of intercostal muscles. You need to know about two of them (the internal and external intercostal muscles) for your exam. We've only shown one layer here for simplicity.

@@@Ventilation: Breathing In and Out
Ventilation consists of inspiration (breathing in) and expiration (breathing out). It's controlled by the movements of the diaphragm, internal and external intercostal muscles, and ribcage. Inspiration involves the contraction of the external intercostal and diaphragm muscles, causing the ribcage to move upwards and outwards and the diaphragm to flatten, increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity. As the volume of the thoracic cavity increases, the lung pressure decreases (to below atmospheric pressure). Air will always flow from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure (i.e. down a pressure gradient) so air flows down the trachea and into the lungs. Inspiration is an active process — it requires energy. Expiration occurs when the muscles relax, causing the ribcage to move downwards and inwards and the diaphragm becomes curved again. This decreases the thoracic cavity's volume and increases air pressure, forcing air out of the lungs. Normal expiration is a passive process and doesn't require energy. During forced expiration, external intercostal muscles relax and internal intercostal muscles contract, pulling the ribcage further down and in. This antagonistic motion facilitates expiration.

@@@Gas Exchange in Alveoli
In Humans, gaseous exchange happens in the alveoli. Lungs contain millions of these microscopic air sacs where gas exchange occurs. The alveoli have a large surface area due to the huge number of them present in the lungs, which facilitates the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Each alveolus is made from a single layer of thin, flat cells called alveolar epithelium. Oxygenated blood is sent to the heart while deoxygenated blood arrives from the heart, facilitating the diffusion of O2 out of the alveoli into the blood and CO2 from the blood into the alveoli to be expelled. The Alveoli are anatomically designed to enable efficient gas exchange. Their structural features include a thin exchange surface and a large surface area, along with a steep concentration gradient of oxygen and carbon dioxide, which is continuously maintained by the flow of blood and ventilation.

@@@Practice and Exam Questions
There are questions for practice and examination.T he practice questions include: Describe the structure of the human gas exchange system, How is normal expiration different to forced expiration? Describe the movement of carbon dioxide and oxygen across the alveolar epithelium. While exam questions ask to describe two ways in which lungs are adapted for efficient gas exchange and describe the process of inspiration. Each question has a mark allocation indicating its significance or length of response expected. The context of these questions surrounds the adaptation of alveoli and their crucial role in gas exchange, reinforcing the material that needs to be mastered for a deeper understanding of human respiratory physiology.

@@@Lungs and Alveoli: Biological Interface with the Environment
A mammal's lungs act as an interface with the environment — they take in air and give out waste gases. Ventilation is the process that moves these gases into and out of the lungs, but the actual exchange of gases with the bloodstream is the responsibility of the alveoli. These well-adapted biological structures are essential for a mammal's respiratory system to function efficiently. The reference to pasta is likely a mnemonic device or a didactic metaphor to facilitate the memorization of the alveoli's function and form."
29,"@@@Overview and Preparation for Dissecting Gas Exchange Systems
After learning all about how different organisms are adapted for efficient gas exchange, you might be wondering what those structures really look like. Well, here are some lovely dissections that you might do. How exciting. As part of your AS or A level in Biology, you're expected to carry out at least one dissection. It could be a dissection of a gaseous exchange system or a mass transport system (or an organ within one of those systems) in either an animal or a plant. You could also be asked about dissections in your exams. There's an example of a plant dissection that you could do on page 79. These two pages cover some animal dissections that you could do as well or instead. Whether it's a plant or animal dissection, you're expected to know how to carry it out safely and ethically. You might also need to record your observations using labelled diagrams.

@@@Dissecting the Gaseous Exchange Systems of Animals
First up, lung dissection is messy, so make sure you're wearing a lab coat. Your dissecting tools (e.g. scalpels, dissecting scissors) should all be clean, sharp, and free from rust — blunt tools don't cut well and can be dangerous. Lay the lungs your teacher has given you on a cutting board. They'll probably be sheep or pig lungs from a butcher's shop. You should be able to see the trachea and two bronchi going into the lungs. To see the lungs inflate, attach a piece of rubber tubing to the trachea and pump air into the lungs using a foot or bicycle pump. The lungs will deflate by themselves because of the elastin in the walls of the alveoli (see p. 61). Never blow down the tube to inflate the lungs — you could end up sucking up stale air from inside the lungs into your mouth. Pop the lungs in a clear plastic bag before you start to stop bacteria inside the lungs from being released into the room. Once you've seen the lungs inflate, you can examine the different tissue types in the lungs. The trachea is supported by C-shaped rings of cartilage. If you do cut the cartilage, be careful — you need to wear goggles to protect your eyes. Cartilage is tough, so if you want to open up the trachea, it's best to cut it lengthways, down the gap in the C-shaped rings. Use dissecting scissors or a scalpel to make the cut. If using a scalpel, cut downwards (not towards you), and don't apply too much pressure to the blade. Continue cutting down one of the bronchi. You should be able to see the bronchioles branching off. Cut off a piece of the lung. The tissue will feel spongy because of the air trapped in all the alveoli. Lungs from a butcher are safe for humans to handle, but they could still contain bacteria that cause food poisoning. That's why it's important to wash your hands after the dissection and disinfect work surfaces.

@@@Dissecting Fish Gills in Bony Fish
Again, make sure you're wearing an apron or lab coat. Place your chosen fish (something like a perch or salmon works well) in a dissection tray or on a cutting board. Gills are located on either side of the fish's head. They're protected on each side by a bony flap called an operculum and supported by gill arches. To remove the gills, push back the operculum and use scissors to carefully remove the gills. Cut each gill arch through the bone at the top and bottom. They should look a bit like this: If you look closely, you should be able to see the gill filaments. For more information about the structure and function of fish gills, see page 56. A single gill arch operculum (the gills are under here)
gill filaments

@@@Dissecting the Gaseous Exchange System in Insects
Big insects like grasshoppers or cockroaches are usually best for dissecting because they're easier to handle. For dissection, you'll need to use an insect that's been humanely killed fairly recently. First fix the insect to a dissecting board. You can put dissecting pins through its legs to hold it in place. To examine the tracheae, you'll need to carefully cut and remove a piece of exoskeleton (the insect's hard outer shell) from along the length of the insect's abdomen. Use a syringe to fill the abdomen with saline solution. You should be able to see a network of very thin, silvery-grey tubes — these are the tracheae. They look silver because they're filled with air. You can examine the tracheae under an optical microscope using a temporary mount slide (see p. 30). Again, the tracheae will appear silver or grey. You should also be able to see rings of chitin in the walls of the tracheae — these are there for support (like the rings of cartilage in a human trachea). Some live insects, e.g. grasshoppers, can cause allergic reactions in some people. They need to be handled very carefully.

@@@Ethical Considerations in Dissection
Dissecting animals (including fish and insects) can give you a better understanding of their anatomy. However, there are some ethical issues involved. Here are some points to think about: Some people argue that it is morally wrong to kill animals just for dissections, as it is unnecessary killing. However, many dissections that are carried out in schools involve animals that have already been killed for their meat, e.g. the sheep's lung dissection on the previous page. (Some people disagree with killing animals altogether though.) There are concerns that the animals used for dissections are not always raised in a humane way — they may be subject to overcrowding, extremes of temperature, or lack of food — and they may not be killed humanely either. If animals (e.g. insects) are raised in school for dissection, it's important to make sure they are looked after properly and killed humanely to minimize any suffering or distress.

@@@Applying Knowledge and Preparing for Exams

Dissection tools should be like your mind — clean and sharp... Well, that's another topic over and done with anyway. Dissections are all about cutting open organisms so you can see everything you've been learning about and hopefully understand it better. You should be able to apply your knowledge of gas exchange systems (see pages 56-59) to any dissections you get asked about in the exams."
30,"@@@Overview of Digestion and Absorption
The whole point of digestion is to break down the food you eat into small molecules that your cells can absorb. As you might imagine, this involves loads of different chemical reactions and our old friends, enzymes. 

@@@The Process of Breaking Down Food Molecules During Digestion
1) The large biological molecules (e.g. starch, proteins) in food are too big to cross cell membranes. This means they can't be absorbed from the gut into the blood. 
2) During digestion, these large molecules are broken down into smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, amino acids), which can move across cell membranes. This means they can be easily absorbed from the gut into the blood, to be transported around the body for use by the body cells. 
3) You might remember from Topic 1 A, that most large biological molecules are polymers, which can be broken down into smaller molecules (monomers) using hydrolysis reactions. Hydrolysis reactions break bonds by adding water. 
4) During hydrolysis, carbohydrates are broken down into disaccharides and then monosaccharides. Fats are broken down into fatty acids and monoglycerides. Proteins are broken down into amino acids.

@@@The Role of Digestive Enzymes in Breaking Down Food
1) A variety of different digestive enzymes are produced by specialised cells in the digestive systems of mammals. These enzymes are then released into the gut to mix with food. 
2) Since enzymes only work with specific substrates (see page 11), different enzymes are needed to catalyse the breakdown of different food molecules.

@@@Carbohydrate Breakdown by Amylase and Disaccharidases
1) Amylase is a digestive enzyme that catalyses the conversion of starch (a polysaccharide) into the smaller sugar maltose (a disaccharide). This involves the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds in starch. 
2) Amylase is produced by the salivary glands (which release amylase into the mouth) and also by the pancreas (which releases amylase into the small intestine). 
3) Membrane-bound disaccharidases are enzymes that are attached to the cell membranes of epithelial cells lining the ileum (the final part of the small intestine). They help to break down disaccharides (e.g. maltose, sucrose, and lactose) into monosaccharides (e.g. glucose, fructose, and galactose). Again, this involves the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds. 
4) Monosaccharides can be transported across the cell membranes of the ileum epithelial cells via specific transporter proteins (see next page). The diagram shows the conversion of disaccharides into monosaccharides by disaccharidase enzymes.

@@@Lipid Digestion by Lipase and the Action of Bile Salts
1) Lipase enzymes catalyse the breakdown of lipids into monoglycerides and fatty acids. This involves the hydrolysis of the ester bonds in lipids. 
2) Lipases are made in the pancreas. They work in the small intestine. 
3) Bile salts are produced by the liver and emulsify lipids — this means they cause the lipids to form small droplets. 
4) Bile salts are really important in the process of lipid digestion. Several small lipid droplets have a bigger surface area than a single large droplet (for the same volume of lipid). So the formation of small droplets greatly increases the surface area of lipid that's available for lipases to work on. 
5) Once the lipid has been broken down, the monoglycerides and fatty acids stick with the bile salts to form tiny structures called micelles.

@@@Protein Breakdown by Endopeptidases and Exopeptidases
Proteins are broken down by a combination of different proteases (or peptidases). These are enzymes that catalyse the conversion of proteins into amino acids by hydrolysing the peptide bonds between amino acids. Endopeptidases hydrolyse peptide bonds within a protein, while exopeptidases act at the ends of protein molecules to remove single amino acids. Dipeptidases, a type of exopeptidase, work specifically on dipeptides, separating the two amino acids. Examples of endopeptidases include trypsin, chymotrypsin, and pepsin, which are synthesised in the pancreas and released into the small intestine, except for pepsin which is active in the stomach.

@@@Absorption of Digestion Products Across Cell Membranes
The products of digestion are absorbed across the ileum epithelium into the bloodstream. Monosaccharides like glucose and galactose are absorbed by active transport along with sodium ions, while fructose is absorbed through facilitated diffusion. Lipid digestion products such as monoglycerides and fatty acids are absorbed with the aid of micelles, which move them towards the epithelium. Amino acids are absorbed using sodium-dependent transporter proteins in the epithelial cell membranes.

@@@Practice and Exam Questions on Digestion
Q1: What is the function of amylase in digestion?
Q2: Describe the role of bile salts in lipid digestion.
For an exam, questions might involve topics such as lactose intolerance, where one is required to suggest which disaccharidase enzyme is deficient and describe how the digestion products of lactose are absorbed across the epithelial cells of the ileum. 

@@@Summary and Encouragement
The concept of digestion and absorption can seem daunting due to the detailed processes and numerous enzymes involved. However, breaking down the information like the digestive system breaks down food can make it easier to understand. Recognizing that enzyme names are often linked to their function can be helpful for remembering key details."
31,"@@@INTRODUCTION TO HAEMOGLOBIN AND ITS FUNCTION IN OXYGEN TRANSPORT

Haemoglobin is a protein that carries oxygen around the body. Different species have different versions of it depending on where each species lives. Oxygen is Carried Round the Body by Haemoglobin. Red blood cells contain haemoglobin (Hb). Haemoglobin is a large protein with a quaternary structure - it's made up of more than one polypeptide chain (four of them in fact). Each chain has a haem group, which contains an iron ion and gives haemoglobin its red colour. Haemoglobin has a high affinity for oxygen — each molecule can carry four oxygen molecules. In the lungs, oxygen joins to haemoglobin in red blood cells to form oxyhaemoglobin. This is a reversible reaction — when oxygen leaves oxyhaemoglobin (dissociates from it) near the body cells, it turns back to haemoglobin. There are many chemically similar types of haemoglobin found in many different organisms, all of which carry out the same function. As well as being found in all vertebrates, haemoglobin is found in earthworms, starfish, some insects, some plants, and even in some bacteria.

@@@HAEMOGLOBIN SATURATION DEPENDS ON PARTIAL PRESSURE OF OXYGEN

Haemoglobin Saturation Depends on the Partial Pressure of Oxygen. The partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) is a measure of oxygen concentration. The greater the concentration of dissolved oxygen in cells, the higher the partial pressure. Similarly, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) is a measure of the concentration of CO2 in a cell. Haemoglobin's affinity for oxygen varies depending on the partial pressure of oxygen: Oxygen loads onto haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin where there's a high pO2, and Oxyhaemoglobin unloads its oxygen where there's a lower pO2. Oxygen enters blood capillaries at the alveoli in the lungs. Alveoli have a high pO2 so oxygen loads onto haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin. When cells respire, they use up oxygen — this lowers the pO2. Red blood cells deliver oxyhaemoglobin to respiring tissues, where it unloads its oxygen. The haemoglobin then returns to the lungs to pick up more oxygen.

@@@DISSOCIATION CURVES AND OXYGEN TRANSPORT

Dissociation Curves Show How Affinity for Oxygen Varies. A dissociation curve shows how saturated the haemoglobin is with oxygen at any given partial pressure. 100% saturation means every haemoglobin molecule is carrying the maximum of 4 molecules of oxygen, and 0% saturation means none of the haemoglobin molecules are carrying any oxygen. The graph is 'S-shaped' because when haemoglobin (Hb) combines with the first O2 molecule, its shape alters in a way that makes it easier for other molecules to join too. But as the Hb starts to become saturated, it gets harder for more oxygen molecules to join. As a result, the curve has a steep bit in the middle where it's really easy for oxygen molecules to join, and shallow bits at each end where it's harder. When the curve is steep, a small change in pO2 causes a big change in the amount of oxygen carried by the Hb.

@@@OXYGEN UNLOADING INFLUENCED BY CARBON DIOXIDE CONCENTRATION AND THE BOHR EFFECT

Carbon Dioxide Concentration Affects Oxygen Unloading. To complicate matters, haemoglobin gives up its oxygen more readily at higher partial pressures of carbon dioxide (pCO2). It's a cunning way of getting more oxygen to cells during activity. When cells respire they produce carbon dioxide, which raises the pCO2. This increases the rate of oxygen unloading (i.e., the rate at which oxyhaemoglobin dissociates to form haemoglobin and oxygen) — so the dissociation curve 'shifts' right. The saturation of blood with oxygen is lower for a given pO2, meaning that more oxygen is being released. This is called the Bohr effect.

@@@ADAPTATION AND VARIATION OF HAEMOGLOBIN IN DIFFERENT ORGANISMS

Haemoglobin is Different in Different Organisms. Different organisms have different types of haemoglobin with different oxygen transporting capacities. Having a particular type of haemoglobin is an adaptation that helps the organism survive in a particular environment. Organisms that live in environments with a low concentration of oxygen have haemoglobin with a higher affinity for oxygen than human haemoglobin — the dissociation curve is to the left of ours. Organisms that are very active and have a high oxygen demand have haemoglobin with a lower affinity for oxygen than human haemoglobin — the curve is to the right of the human one.

@@@PRACTICE AND EXAM QUESTIONS ON HAEMOGLOBIN AND DISSOCIATION CURVES

Practice Questions. Q1 How many oxygen molecules can each haemoglobin molecule carry? Q2 Where in the body would you find a low partial pressure of oxygen?

@@@MAKING SENSE OF PARTIAL PRESSURE AND THE BOHR EFFECT IN HAEMOGLOBIN FUNCTION

There’s more than partial pressure on you to learn this stuff... Well, I don't know about you but after these pages I need a sit down. Most people get their knickers in a twist over partial pressure — it's not the easiest thing to understand. Whenever you see it written down just pretend it says concentration instead (cross it out and write concentration if you like) and everything should become clearer. Honest. The Bohr Effect."
32,"@@@Introduction to Enzyme-Controlled Reactions and Measurement Techniques
Science isn't all about words and theory; it's also about getting your pipette dirty and making bad smells (in the name of discovery of course). These pages show you how to measure the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction.

@@@Measuring the Rate of Enzyme-Controlled Reactions with Oxygen Production
You can measure the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction. Here are two ways of measuring the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction: 1) You can measure how fast the product of the reaction is made. Catalase catalyses the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. It's easy to measure the volume of oxygen produced and to work out how fast it's given off. The diagram below shows the apparatus you'll need. The oxygen released displaces the water from the measuring cylinder. (A stand and clamp would also be pretty useful to hold the cylinder upside down, as would a stopwatch and a water bath.)

@@@Step-by-Step Guide for Measuring Reaction Rate Using Catalase
Here's how to carry out the experiment:
1) Set up boiling tubes containing the same volume and concentration of hydrogen peroxide.
2) To keep the pH constant, add equal volumes of a suitable buffer solution to each tube. (A buffer solution is able to resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or alkali are added.)
3) Set up the rest of the apparatus as shown in the diagram.
4) Put each boiling tube in a water bath set to a different temperature (e.g. 10 °C, 20 °C, 30 °C, and 40 °C) along with another tube containing catalase (wait 5 minutes before moving onto the next step so the enzyme gets up to temperature).
5) Use a pipette to add the same volume and concentration of catalase to each boiling tube. Then quickly attach the bung and delivery tube.
6) Record how much oxygen is produced in the first minute (60 s) of the reaction. Use a stopwatch to measure the time.
7) Repeat the experiment at each temperature three times, and use the results to find an average volume of oxygen produced.
8) Calculate the average rate of reaction at each temperature by dividing the volume of oxygen produced by the time taken (i.e. 60 s). The units will be cm3/s.
A negative control reaction, i.e., a boiling tube not containing catalase, should also be carried out at each temperature.

@@@Measuring Reaction Rate by Substrate Breakdown with Amylase
2) You can measure how fast the substrate is broken down. The enzyme amylase catalyses the breakdown of starch to maltose. The diagram shows how the experiment can be set up. You'll need the apparatus shown in the diagram as well as a stopwatch. A drop of iodine in potassium iodide is put into each well on a spotting tile. A known concentration of amylase and starch are then mixed together in a test tube. A dropping pipette is used to put a drop of this mixture into one of the wells containing the iodine solution on the spotting tile at regular intervals and the resulting color is observed. The iodine solution goes dark blue-black when starch is present but remains its normal browny-orange color when there's no starch around. You can see how fast amylase is working by recording how long it takes for the iodine solution to no longer turn blue-black when starch/amylase mixture is added. Repeat the experiment using different concentrations of amylase. Make sure that you also repeat the experiment three times at each amylase concentration.

@@@Investigating the Effects of Different Variables on Enzyme-Controlled Reactions
The experiments above show you how you can investigate the effects of temperature and enzyme concentration on the rate of enzyme-controlled reactions. You can also alter these experiments to investigate the effect of a different variable, such as pH (by adding a buffer solution with a different pH to each test tube) or substrate concentration (you could use serial dilutions to make substrate solutions with different concentrations). The key to experiments like this is to remember to only change one variable — everything else should stay the same.

@@@Topic Summary: Biological Molecules
Topic 1A — Biological Molecules"
33,"@@@Overview of the Circulatory System
The circulatory system, as the name suggests, is responsible for circulating substances throughout the body, particularly blood, which is essential for life. The system is indispensable in most multicellular organisms, including mammals, insects, and fish. Due to a low surface area to volume ratio, complex organisms require a specialized system to transport vital raw materials from special exchange organs to individual cells; this needs a cirulatory system comprised of the heart and various types of blood vessels. The circulatory system operates on two main circuits: one for directing blood from the heart to the lungs and back, and another for transporting it around the rest of the body. Not to be overlooked, the heart also has its own blood supply provided by the coronary arteries.

@@@Structure and Function of Diverse Blood Vessels
The text describes the different types of vessels within the circulatory system, such as arteries, arterioles, and veins, each having unique features and roles. Arteries are robust and muscular, capable of maintaining high pressure necessary for delivering blood from the heart to the body. They further branch into arterioles, which regulate blood flow to various regions based on the body's demands. In contrast, veins are structured to transport blood back to the heart under low pressure, generally carrying deoxygenated blood except for the pulmonary veins, and they have valves to prevent backflow. Central to the exchange of substances are the capillaries, the smallest blood vessels, which facilitate the transfer of nutrients and gases between cells and blood.

@@@Capillary Functions and the Formation of Tissue Fluid
The capillaries network into capillary beds within tissues to maximize the diffusion of necessary substances, such as glucose and oxygen, to cells. The proximity of capillaries to cells and their one-cell-thick walls optimize this diffusion. Tissue fluid is formed from blood plasma and surrounds tissue cells, providing them with nutrients and oxygen while receiving metabolic waste. The movement of substances in and out of capillaries and tissue fluid is governed by hydrostatic and osmotic pressure. Any surplus tissue fluid is collected by the lymphatic system and returned to the circulatory system.

@@@Pathological Implications and Study Materials
The text also intimates that an imbalance in hydrostatic pressure can cause the accumulation of excess tissue fluid within tissues, a condition related to high blood pressure. This segment prepares students with practice and exam questions related to the circulatory system, asking them to name blood vessels, describe various types, explain fluid movements, and connect structural features of blood vessels to their functions. Lastly, a light-hearted personal anecdote remarks on transport efficiency and emphasizes the biological fascination with the interplay between structure and function, especially in veins, arteries, and capillaries.ss"

@@@The Cardiac Cycle and its Phases
The Cardiac Cycle Pumps Blood Round the BodyThe cardiac cycle is an ongoing sequence of contraction and relaxation of the atria and ventricles that keeps blood continuously circulating round the body. The volume of the atria and ventricles changes as they contract and relax. Pressure changes also occur, due to the changes in chamber volume (e.g. decreasing the volume of a chamber by contraction will increase the pressure in a chamber). The cardiac cycle can be simplified into three stages:© ( Ventricles relax, atria contract )The ventricles are relaxed.The atria contract, decreasing the volume of the chambers and increasing the pressure inside the chambers.

The diagram is a good reminder that veins carry blood into the heart (vena cava and pulmonary vein) and arteries carry blood away from it (pulmonary artery and aorta). The major components identified in the diagram include the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, right atrium, semi-lunar valve, right atrioventricular valve, pulmonary vein, left atrium, left atrioventricular valve, cords (valve tendons), right ventricle, and left ventricle.

The valves only open one way — whether they're open or closed depends on the relative pressure of the heart chambers. If there's higher pressure behind a valve, it's forced open, but if pressure is higher in front of the valve it's forced shut. This means blood only flows in one direction through the heart. The pressure dynamics are depicted as higher/lower with arrows indicating the direction of flow and the state of valves (closed/open).

@@@Analyzing Cardiac Cycle Data
The Heart: You Might be Asked to Interpret Data on the Cardiac Cycle: You may well be asked to analyze or interpret data about the changes in pressure and volume during the cardiac cycle. Here are two examples of the kind of things you might get: 

Example 1: describes a situation where you may have to describe the changes in pressure and volume shown by a diagram, like the one on the right.

Example 2: If you get a graph, you could be asked questions such as when blood starts flowing into the aorta, why ventricular volume is decreasing at a certain point, and whether the semi-lunar valves are open or closed.

The left ventricle has a thicker wall than the right ventricle and so contracts more forcefully. This means the pressure is higher in the left ventricle (and in the aorta compared to the pulmonary artery).

Practice Questions and an Exam Question are provided with the topics to test understanding, including questions about the sides of the heart carrying oxygenated blood, the purpose of the semi-lunar valves, and identifying blood vessels. Exam questions challenge students to use the data in a table showing blood pressure in two heart chambers at different times during part of the cardiac cycle, with specific questions related to AV valves, ventricular relaxation, and calculating percentage increase in left ventricle blood pressure.

The text concludes with a whimsical analogy comparing the cardiac cycle to a ""bewilderingly complicated pump-action bicycle,"" suggesting the importance of understanding the interplay of pressure and volume changes for exams.

36,"@@@Introduction to Cardiovascular Disease
Diseases associated with your heart and blood vessels are called cardiovascular diseases (cardio = heart, vascular = blood vessels — geddit?). There are certain factors that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

@@@Pathogenesis of Cardiovascular Disease: Atheroma Formation
Most Cardiovascular Disease Starts with Atheroma Formation. The wall of an artery is made up of several layers (see p. 70). The endothelium (inner lining) is usually smooth and unbroken. If damage occurs to the endothelium (e.g., by high blood pressure) white blood cells (mostly macrophages) and lipids (fat) from the blood, clump together under the lining to form fatty streaks. Over time, more white blood cells, lipids and connective tissue build up and harden to form a fibrous plaque called an atheroma. This plaque partially blocks the lumen of the artery and restricts blood flow, which causes blood pressure to increase. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a type of cardiovascular disease. It occurs when the coronary arteries have lots of atheromas in them, which restricts blood flow to the heart muscle. It can lead to myocardial infarction (see below).

@@@Complications of Atheroma: Aneurysm and Thrombosis
Atheromas Increase the Risk of Aneurysm and Thrombosis. Two types of disease that affect the arteries are:

Aneurysm — a balloon-like swelling of the artery. Atheroma plaques damage and weaken arteries. They also narrow arteries, increasing blood pressure. When blood travels through a weakened artery at high pressure, it may push the inner layers of the artery through the outer elastic layer to form a balloon-like swelling — an aneurysm. This aneurysm may burst, causing a haemorrhage (bleeding).

Thrombosis — formation of a blood clot. An atheroma plaque can rupture (burst through) the endothelium (inner lining) of an artery. This damages the artery wall and leaves a rough surface. Platelets and fibrin (a protein) accumulate at the site of damage and form a blood clot (a thrombus). This blood clot can cause a complete blockage of the artery, or it can become dislodged and block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body. Debris from the rupture can cause another blood clot to form further down the artery.

@@@Myocardial Infarction Due to Cardiovascular Disease
Interrupted Blood Flow to the Heart can Cause a Myocardial Infarction. The heart muscle is supplied with blood by the coronary arteries. This blood contains the oxygen needed by heart muscle cells to carry out respiration. If a coronary artery becomes completely blocked (e.g., by a blood clot) an area of the heart muscle will be totally cut off from its blood supply, receiving no oxygen. This causes a myocardial infarction — more commonly known as a heart attack. A heart attack can cause damage and death of the heart muscle. Symptoms include pain in the chest and upper body, shortness of breath and sweating. If large areas of the heart are affected complete heart failure can occur, which is often fatal.

@@@Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease
Some Factors Increase the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease. Some of the most common risk factors for cardiovascular disease are:

High blood cholesterol and poor diet. If the blood cholesterol level is high (above 240 mg per 100 cm3) then the risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. This is because cholesterol is one of the main constituents of the fatty deposits that form atheromas (see previous page). Atheromas can lead to increased blood pressure and blood clots. This could block the flow of blood to coronary arteries, which could cause a myocardial infarction (see previous page for details). A diet high in saturated fat is associated with high blood cholesterol levels. A diet high in salt also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease because it increases the risk of high blood pressure (see below).

Cigarette smoking. Both nicotine and carbon monoxide, found in cigarette smoke, increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Nicotine increases the risk of high blood pressure (see below). Carbon monoxide combines with haemoglobin and reduces the amount of oxygen transported in the blood, and so reduces the amount of oxygen available to tissues. If heart muscle doesn't receive enough oxygen it can lead to a heart attack (see previous page). Smoking also decreases the amount of antioxidants in the blood — these are important for protecting cells from damage. Fewer antioxidants means cell damage in the coronary artery walls is more likely, and this can lead to atheroma formation.

High blood pressure. High blood pressure increases the risk of damage to the artery walls. Damaged walls have an increased risk of atheroma formation, causing a further increase in blood pressure. Atheromas can also cause blood clots to form (see previous page). A blood clot could block the flow of blood to the heart muscle, possibly resulting in myocardial infarction. So anything that increases blood pressure also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, e.g. being overweight, not exercising and excessive alcohol consumption. Other factors include age (risk increases with age) and sex (men are more at risk than women).

Most of these factors are within our control — a person can choose to smoke, eat fatty foods, etc. However, some risk factors can't be controlled, such as having a genetic predisposition to coronary heart disease or having high blood pressure as a result of another condition, e.g. some forms of diabetes. Even so, the risk of developing cardiovascular disease can be reduced by removing as many risk factors as you possibly can."
37,"@@@Introduction to Lipids: Importance and Basic Composition
Lipids are really nice. Without them, we'd have no cell membranes. You owe it to them to make sure you can remember all of the stuff about them on these pages. It'll help you and your membranes get a good grade. Triglycerides are a Kind of Lipid Triglycerides have one molecule of glycerol with three fatty acids attached to it.

@@@Structure of a Triglyceride and its Hydrophobic Nature
Structure of a Triglyceride Fatty acid molecules have long tails made of hydrocarbons. The tails are 'hydrophobic' (they repel water molecules). These tails make lipids insoluble in water. All fatty acids have the same basic structure, but the hydrocarbon tail varies. Fatty Acid0Fatty Acid0Fatty Acid hydrocarbon 'tail' of fatty acids Basic Structure of a Fatty Acid carbon atom links fatty acid to glycerol C—RHO variable 'R*' group hydrocarbon tail

@@@Formation of Triglycerides through Condensation Reactions
Triglycerides are Formed by Condensation Reactions glycerol H2O is released H fatty acid0VH—C—OH+XIH-C—OH H2O condensation reaction Two more fatty acids are attached in the same way here and here triglyceride... ester bond V, H—C—O—'C—R9H—C—O—C—R9H—C—O—C—R1H The diagram shows a fatty acid joining to a glycerol molecule. When the ester bond is formed, a molecule of water is released— it's a condensation reaction. This process happens twice more to form a triglyceride.

@@@Properties of Fatty Acids: Saturated versus Unsaturated
Fatty Acids can be Saturated or Unsaturated There are two kinds of fatty acids — saturated and unsaturated. The difference is in their hydrocarbon tails (R group). Saturated fatty acids don't have any double bonds between their carbon atoms. Unsaturated fatty acids have at least one double bond between carbon atoms, which cause the chain to kink. Saturated hydrocarbon tail Unsaturated hydrocarbon tail

@@@Phospholipids and their Role in Cell Membranes
Phospholipids are Similar to Triglycerides 1) The lipids found in cell membranes aren't triglycerides— they're phospholipids. 2) Phospholipids are pretty similar to triglycerides except one of the fatty acid molecules is replaced by a phosphate group. 3) The phosphate group is hydrophilic (attracts water). The fatty acid tails are hydrophobic (repel water). This is important in the cell membrane (see next page to find out why). Structure of a Phospholipid

@@@Functional Importance of Lipids and their Structures
The Structures of Lipids Relate to Their Functions You need to know how the structures of triglycerides and phospholipids are related to their functions: Triglycerides are mainly used as energy storage molecules. They're good for this because: 1) The long hydrocarbon tails of the fatty acids contain lots of chemical energy— a load of energy is released when they're broken down. Because of these tails, lipids contain about twice as much energy per gram as carbohydrates. 2) They're insoluble, so they don't affect the water potential (see p. 40) of the cell and cause water to enter the cells by osmosis (which would make them swell). The triglycerides clump together as insoluble droplets in cells because the fatty acid tails are hydrophobic (water-repelling) — the tails face inwards, shielding themselves from water with their glycerol heads. Phospholipids make up the bilayer of cell membranes (see p. 36). Cell membranes control what enters and leaves a cell. 1) Their heads are hydrophilic and their tails are hydrophobic, so they form a double layer with their heads facing out towards the water on either side. 2) The centre of the bilayer is hydrophobic, so water-soluble substances can't easily pass through it — the membrane acts as a barrier to those substances.

@@@Testing for Lipids: The Emulsion Test
Use the Emulsion Test for Lipids If you wanted to find out if there was any fat in a particular food you could do the emulsion test: 1) Shake the test substance with ethanol for about a minute so that it dissolves, then pour the solution into water. 2) Any lipid will show up as a milky emulsion. 3) The more lipid there is, the more noticeable the milky color will be. Test substance and ethanol Shake Add to water Milky color indicates lipid

38,"@@@Understanding Cardiovascular Disease: Introduction and Atheroma Formation
Diseases associated with your heart and blood vessels are called cardiovascular diseases (cardio = heart, vascular = blood vessels — geddit?). There are certain factors that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Most cardiovascular disease starts with atheroma formation. The wall of an artery is made up of several layers (see p. 70). The endothelium (inner lining) is usually smooth and unbroken. If damage occurs to the endothelium (e.g. by high blood pressure) white blood cells (mostly macrophages) and lipids (fat) from the blood, clump together under the lining to form fatty streaks. Over time, more white blood cells, lipids and connective tissue build up and harden to form a fibrous plaque called an atheroma. This plaque partially blocks the lumen of the artery and restricts blood flow, which causes blood pressure to increase. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a type of cardiovascular disease. It occurs when the coronary arteries have lots of atheromas in them, which restricts blood flow to the heart muscle. It can lead to myocardial infarction (see below).

@@@Further Complications: Aneurysm and Thrombosis from Atheromas
Atheromas increase the risk of aneurysm and thrombosis. An aneurysm is a balloon-like swelling of the artery, which can occur if atheroma plaques damage and weaken arteries, and also narrow them, increasing blood pressure. The increased pressure can push the inner layers of the artery through the outer elastic layer to form a balloon-like swelling — an aneurysm. If an aneurysm bursts, it can cause serious hemorrhage (bleeding). A thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot. An atheroma plaque can rupture the endothelium of an artery, damaging the wall and creating a rough surface where platelets and fibrin accumulate to form a clot. This thrombus can block the artery completely or dislodge and cause a blockage elsewhere in the body. Debris from the rupture can also lead to further blood clots.

@@@Myocardial Infarction: Blood Flow Interruption and its Effects
Interrupted blood flow to the heart can lead to a myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack. The coronary arteries supply the heart muscle with oxygenated blood for respiration. A complete blockage in a coronary artery can cut off the blood supply to part of the heart muscle, leading to the death of that tissue—a myocardial infarction. Symptoms can include chest pain, shortness of breath, and sweating. In severe cases, where large areas of the heart are affected, complete heart failure can occur, which is often fatal.

@@@Risk Factors and Lifestyle Choices Influencing Cardiovascular Disease
Some factors that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease include high blood cholesterol and poor diet, which contribute to atheroma formation and therefore increase the risk of high blood pressure and blood clots. A diet high in saturated fat and salt also increases these risks. Cigarette smoking introduces nicotine and carbon monoxide, which impair cardiovascular health by increasing blood pressure and reducing oxygen transportation. High blood pressure alone can lead to artery wall damage and atheroma formation. Age, sex, genetic predisposition, and conditions like diabetes are additional risk factors, though lifestyle choices and managing controllable risk factors can mitigate some of the risks.

@@@Interpreting Data on Risk Factors and Cardiovascular Disease
Evaluating studies on cardiovascular risk factors is crucial. For example, analyzing the data from a study involving 27,939 American women showed that the relative risk of a cardiovascular event increases with higher LDL cholesterol levels. However, drawing valid conclusions requires looking at the study design, sample size, and variables considered. Conflicting evidence from different studies might exist, and resolving these conflicts often necessitates further research. Data from large populations and good study designs provide stronger evidence, while things like self-reported questionnaires can introduce unreliability.

@@@Learning and Application: Studies on Cardiovascular Risk and Revision Tips
Understanding how to interpret and evaluate studies is an essential skill. For instance, knowing how to assess the strength of evidence from a study involving 168,000 people from 63 countries, which found a correlation between waist measurement and cardiovascular disease, is critical. When revising, it's important to grasp the connections between atheromas, thrombosis, and heart attacks, recognizing that lifestyle factors such as diet and smoking can exacerbate the risks associated with cardiovascular diseases."
39,"@@@Introduction to Transport in Plants and the Role of Xylem
Transport in Plants — Xylem: Transport in plants isn't really roads and railways, but I guess it's a bit like a flowing river that's carrying stuff around in a network of tubes. When you consider the movement of water, it's all about the xylem. It's pretty exciting stuff.

@@@Tissue Types Involved in Plant Transport
Two Types of Tissue are Involved in Transport in Plants: 1) Xylem tissue transports water and mineral ions in solution. These substances move up the plant from the roots to the leaves. 2) Phloem tissue transports organic substances like sugars (also in solution) both up and down the plant — there's more about the phloem on pages 80-81. 3) Xylem and phloem are mass transport systems (see page 54) — they move substances over large distances.

@@@Structure and Function of Xylem Vessels
Xylem vessels are the part of the xylem tissue that actually transports the water and ions. Xylem vessels are very long, tube-like structures formed from dead cells (vessel elements) joined end to end. There are no end walls on these cells, making an uninterrupted tube that allows water to pass up through the middle easily.

@@@Mechanism of Water Movement in Plants
Water Moves Up a Plant Against the Force of Gravity: Cohesion and tension help water move up plants, from roots to leaves, against the force of gravity. 1) Water evaporates from the leaves at the 'top' of the xylem (this is transpiration — see below). 2) This creates tension (suction), which pulls more water into the leaf. 3) Water molecules are cohesive (they stick together — see page 21) so when some are pulled into the leaf others follow. 4) Water enters the stem through the roots.

@@@Transpiration and Its Role in Plants
Transpiration is Loss of Water from a Plant’s Surface: Transpiration is the evaporation of water from a plant's surface, especially the leaves. 1) Water evaporates from the moist cell walls and accumulates in the spaces between cells in the leaf. 2) When the stomata open (see page 57), it moves out of the leaf down the concentration gradient (there's more water inside the leaf than in the air outside).

@@@Factors Influencing Transpiration
Four Main Factors Affect Transpiration Rate: 1) Light — the lighter it is the faster the transpiration rate (i.e., there's a positive correlation between light intensity and transpiration rate). 2) Temperature — the higher the temperature the faster the transpiration rate. 3) Humidity — the lower the humidity, the faster the transpiration rate (i.e., there's a negative correlation between humidity and transpiration rate). 4) Wind — the windier it is, the faster the transpiration rate.

@@@Measuring Transpiration with a Potometer
Transport in Plants — Xylem: A Potometer can be Used to Estimate Transpiration Rate: A potometer is a special piece of apparatus used to estimate transpiration rates. It actually measures water uptake by a plant but it's assumed that water uptake by the plant is directly related to water loss by the leaves.

@@@Procedures for Using a Potometer
Procedure for Using a Potometer: Here's what you'd do: 1) Cut a shoot underwater to prevent air from entering the xylem. 2) Assemble the potometer in water and insert the shoot underwater. 3) Remove the apparatus from the water but keep the end of the capillary tube submerged. 4) Dry the leaves, shut the tap, and record the starting position of the air bubble. 5) Start a stopwatch and record the distance moved by the bubble per unit time.

@@@Studying Plant Tissues: Dissection and Microscopy
You Might Have to Dissect Plants: To examine plant tissues such as xylem or phloem under a microscope, one must follow a meticulous process that involves cutting a cross-section of the stem and then preparing the section of the tissue using stains and mounting it onto a slide.

@@@Review and Examination Techniques
Practice Examination Questions: End of the chapter includes practice and exam-style questions to test the understanding of the function of xylem tissue, factors affecting transpiration rate, and methods used to measure the transpiration rate like the potometer.

@@@Xylem's Significance and a Touch of Humor
Conclusion and Levity: The section concludes by emphasizing the importance of xylem for water transport in plants, culminating in a note that xylem should not be confused with Wylam, a small village in Northumberland, adding a light-hearted touch to the educational content."
40,"@@@Introduction to Transport in Plants — Phloem Function and Adaptations
Transport in plants plays a crucial role in their survival and growth. Phloem tissue, distinct from xylem, is specialized in the movement of dissolved organic substances such as sugars and amino acids. The structure of phloem tissue facilitates this transport, where critical cell types include sieve tube elements and companion cells. Sieve tube elements, living cells forming the transport tubes, lack a nucleus and contain minimal organelles to maximize solute movement. Companion cells play a supportive role for sieve tube elements by managing metabolic processes necessary for active transport. 

@@@Mechanism of Solutes Movement — Translocation
Translocation, the energy-dependent process in which solutes are transferred from a source (where solutes are created) to a sink (where they're utilized), is fundamental to plant health and development. Sources typically are the photosynthetically active leaves, and sinks include areas of growth and storage organs. Enzymatic activity ensures a concentration gradient is maintained between these points to facilitate constant solute movement. Sucrose, a common solute, is often converted into other substances like starch at sink locations to perpetuate this gradient.

@@@The Mass Flow Hypothesis — The Theoretical Framework for Phloem Transport
Our understanding of how phloem transports solutes is encapsulated in the mass flow hypothesis, which proposes a mechanism based on pressure gradients facilitated by water potential differences. Solutes are actively loaded into the phloem at the source, lowering the water potential therein. This osmotically drives water into the sieve tubes from the xylem and companion cells, creating pressure. At the sink, solutes are removed, water potential increases, and pressure reduces, resulting in water leaving the tubes. The differential pressures propel solutes through the phloem, with numerous experiments indicating varying solute movement strategies, including through cell walls.

@@@Evaluating Evidence For and Against the Mass Flow Hypothesis
Diverse experiments have been conducted to understand and validate the mass flow model. Among these, observing the effects of bark removal; utilizing radioactive tracers; studying phloem pressure with aphids, and the impact of metabolic inhibitors promote comprehension of this complex process. While evidence supports the model of mass transport, anomalies challenge its comprehensiveness. Issues like the difficulty of solute movement through sieve plates and solute distribution not strictly following water potential suggest that our models could evolve with new data and insights.

@@@Experimental Demonstration of the Translocation of Solutes
Experimental techniques, particularly using radioactive tracers, have been developed to demonstrate and analyze the movement of solutes within plants. By providing a radioactively labeled substance to a part of the plant, its subsequent incorporation into sugars and amino acids, and their redistribution can be observed using autoradiography. Images produced from this process illustrate the dynamic nature of translocation over time, from the leaves—the production sites—toward various sinks, such as roots and fruits.

@@@Practical Applications and Understanding of the Mass Flow Hypothesis
Students of plant biology must not only understand the theory behind phloem transport but also the application of this knowledge. Practice questions aim to reinforce the principles of the mass flow hypothesis, such as establishing pressure gradients, and the actual movement paths of photosynthesis products. These theories aptly describe our current understanding, yet they remain scientific models, subject to change with new evidence and research advancements. In the broader context of transport within living organisms, the mass flow concept serves as a fundamental framework that may extend and modify itself as scientific investigation continues."
41,"@@@Introduction to DNA, Genes, and Chromosomes
82 Topic 4 begins with a lighthearted reference to DNA’s impact on personal traits, then moves on to explain how DNA is responsible for coding our genetic information and the differences in DNA storage between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. This section introduces the subject matter related to DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, promising to provide detailed information on the packaging of DNA, what genes are, and their role in coding for proteins and other molecules.

@@@DNA Storage in Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Cells
DNA is universally structured among organisms, but there is a notable difference in the way it is stored between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. In eukaryotic cells, including both animal and plant cells, DNA is linear and interacts with proteins. DNA molecules exist as chromosomes found in the cell nucleus. They are made thread-like by being wound around histone proteins and further coiled to form compact chromosomes. The mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells possess their own DNA, circular in shape and not bound to histones, similar to the DNA in prokaryotic cells. On the other hand, prokaryotic cells, primarily bacteria, contain shorter and circular DNA chromosomes that supercoil to fit within the cell structure.

@@@The Function and Composition of Genes
Genes are sequences of DNA bases coding for either polypeptides or functional RNA. They determine the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide, thereby dictating the protein's primary structure. This sequence is determined by the order of triplet bases in DNA. Furthermore, genes can code for functional RNA molecules, such as tRNA and rRNA, which are essential for protein synthesis. This section also introduces concepts like the genome, which is the complete set of a cell's genes, and the proteome, which is the full range of proteins a cell can produce.

@@@Genetic Coding and Variation in Eukaryotes
83 The discussion extends to nuances in eukaryotic DNA, emphasizing that most DNA does not encode polypeptides but may code for functional RNA. Details about introns and exons within the genes are provided, explaining that introns, the non-coding sections, are removed during protein synthesis, while exons which do code for amino acids are spliced together. Eukaryotic DNA also contains non-coding repeats, regions outside of genes that have repetitive sequences. Additionally, this subsection covers genome variation through alleles, which are different forms of a gene coding for variants of a polypeptide, influencing characteristics such as blood type. Essential genetic concepts are iterated, inclusive of the organization of chromosomes in homologous pairs within a cell nucleus, the position of alleles at a specific locus, and the implication of these allelic differences.

@@@Practice and Exam Questions
In a didactic conclusion, readers are presented with practice questions aiming to reinforce concepts such as DNA triplets, introns, non-coding repeats, and loci. Exam questions task readers with describing eukaryotic DNA storage and calculating the number of amino acids in a polypeptide section based on exon and intron lengths within a DNA sequence. These assessments are designed to ensure understanding and retention of the material presented within the topic, with a focus on the importance of introns and exons in genetic coding."
42,"@@@Overview of RNA and Protein Synthesis
Protein synthesis involves two stages — transcription and translation. They both involve RNA. RNA is a single polynucleotide strand and it contains uracil (U) as a base instead of thymine (see p. 16). Uracil always pairs with adenine during protein synthesis. There are different types of RNA, each serving a distinct role in the process of protein synthesis.

@@@Types of RNA
There are several types of RNA to be aware of:
- Messenger RNA (mRNA) is created during transcription. It carries the genetic code from DNA to the ribosomes, where it is utilized in protein assembly during translation. mRNA consists of groups of three adjacent bases, known as codons.
- Transfer RNA (tRNA) is involved in translation. It transports the amino acids to the ribosomes, where they are linked to form proteins. tRNA has a specific structure, which includes a cloverleaf shape due to intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Every tRNA molecule has an anticodon at one end and an amino acid binding site at the other.

@@@Transcription: The First Stage of Protein Synthesis
Transcription is the process where an mRNA copy of a gene is made. This occurs within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, or in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells since they lack a nucleus. The process starts with RNA polymerase binding to DNA and initiating the mRNA synthesis by transcribing one strand of the DNA. The strands of DNA separate and nucleotide pairing occurs, where uracil replaces the thymine from DNA. The mRNA is formed and processed before it leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore to the cytoplasm, where it is ready for translation.

@@@RNA and Protein Synthesis Differences Between Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes
The transcription process results in different intermediate products in eukaryotes compared to prokaryotes. In eukaryotes, initially, both introns and exons are copied into pre-mRNA, which is then spliced to remove the introns, resulting in mature mRNA. In prokaryotes, the mRNA is synthesized directly from DNA without a splicing process as prokaryotic DNA does not contain introns.

@@@Translation: The Second Stage of Protein Synthesis
During translation, which occurs at the ribosomes, amino acids are linked together to form a protein, following the sequence coded by the mRNA. The mRNA attaches to a ribosome, tRNA brings in amino acids, and through a sequence of base pairing and peptide bond formation, a polypeptide chain grows until a stop signal on the mRNA is reached, marking the end of the protein synthesis.

@@@Assessment and Summary Questions
The text includes a set of practice questions and an exam question to encourage understanding and retention of the material covered:
- The structure of tRNA and the site of transcription in eukaryotes are used as practice questions to reinforce learning.
- An exam question describes a scenario in which a drug that inhibits cell growth binds to DNA and interferes with RNA polymerase, asking for an explanation on how this would affect protein synthesis.

The final paragraph refers to the reader's need to understand the detailed process of protein synthesis, using a lighthearted tone to suggest various methods to memorize the information. It emphasizes the complexity and significance of protein synthesis and indirectly motivates the reader to appreciate the biological details involved."
43,"@@@Enzyme-Controlled Reactions: Measuring the Reaction Rate

Science isn't all about words and theory; it's also about getting your pipette dirty and making bad smells (in the name of discovery, of course). These pages show you how to measure the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction. You can measure the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction. Here are two ways of measuring the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction: 

1) You Can Measure How Fast the Product of the Reaction is Made
Catalase catalyses the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. It's easy to measure the volume of oxygen produced and to work out how fast it's given off. The diagram below shows the apparatus you'll need. The oxygen released displaces the water from the measuring cylinder. (A stand and clamp would also be pretty useful to hold the cylinder upside down, as would a stopwatch and a water bath.)

Here's how to carry out the experiment:
1) Set up boiling tubes containing the same volume and concentration of hydrogen peroxide.
2) To keep the pH constant, add equal volumes of a suitable buffer solution to each tube. (A buffer solution is able to resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or alkali are added.)
3) Set up the rest of the apparatus as shown in the diagram.
4) Put each boiling tube in a water bath set to a different temperature (e.g. 10 °C, 20 °C, 30 °C, and 40 °C) along with another tube containing catalase (wait 5 minutes before moving onto the next step so the enzyme gets up to temperature).
5) Use a pipette to add the same volume and concentration of catalase to each boiling tube. Then quickly attach the bung and delivery tube.
6) Record how much oxygen is produced in the first minute (60 s) of the reaction. Use a stopwatch to measure the time.
7) Repeat the experiment at each temperature three times, and use the results to find an average volume of oxygen produced.

Calculate the average rate of reaction at each temperature by dividing the volume of oxygen produced by the time taken (i.e., 60 s). The units will be cm³/s. A negative control reaction, i.e., a boiling tube not containing catalase, should also be carried out at each temperature.

2) You Can Measure How Fast the Substrate is Broken Down
The enzyme amylase catalyses the breakdown of starch to maltose. The diagram shows how the experiment can be set up. You'll need the apparatus shown in the diagram as well as a stopwatch. 

A drop of iodine in potassium iodide is put into each well on a spotting tile. A known concentration of amylase and starch are then mixed together in a test tube. A dropping pipette is used to put a drop of this mixture into one of the wells containing the iodine solution on the spotting tile at regular intervals and the resulting color is observed. The iodine solution goes dark blue-black when starch is present but remains its normal browny-orange color when there's no starch around. You can see how fast amylase is working by recording how long it takes for the iodine solution to no longer turn blue-black when starch/amylase mixture is added. Repeat the experiment using different concentrations of amylase. Make sure that you also repeat the experiment three times at each amylase concentration.

The experiments above show you how you can investigate the effects of temperature and enzyme concentration on the rate of enzyme-controlled reactions. You can also alter these experiments to investigate the effect of a different variable, such as pH (by adding a buffer solution with a different pH to each test tube) or substrate concentration (you could use serial dilutions to make substrate solutions with different concentrations). The key to experiments like this is to remember to only change one variable — everything else should stay the same.

@@@Interpreting Graphs of Enzyme-Controlled Reactions

You need to be able to interpret graphs of enzyme-controlled reactions. The results of enzyme-controlled reactions are usually shown in line graphs. You might be asked to interpret the graph of an enzyme-controlled reaction in the exam. The graph below shows the release of a product over time for reactions conducted at different temperatures. First, look at the start of the graph and compare the rates of reaction here. E.g., the rate of reaction is fastest at 65°C. Use what you know about factors affecting enzyme activity to explain why (see p. 12). You might have to work out the initial rate of reaction (see below).

Now, look at what else the graphs are showing you and make comparisons between the different temperatures. At 37°C the graph has plateaued (flattened out) because all the substrates have been used up. At 65°C the graph has plateaued earlier than at 37°C, because the high temperature caused the enzyme to denature, so the reaction stopped sooner. Not as much product was made because not all the substrates were converted to product before the enzyme was denatured, so there is still substrate left. At 25°C the rate of reaction is remaining constant and the volume of product is continuing to increase because not all of the substrates have been used up.

You Can Use a Tangent to Calculate the Initial Rate of Reaction
The initial rate of reaction is the rate of reaction right at the start of the reaction, close to time equals zero (t = 0) on the graph. To work out the initial rate of reaction, carry out the following steps:

1) Draw a tangent to the curve at t = 0, using a ruler. Do this by positioning the ruler so it's an equal distance from the curve at both sides of where it's touching it. Here you'll have to estimate where the curve would continue if it carried on below zero. Then draw a line along the ruler. (For more on drawing tangents see p. 212.)
2) Then calculate the gradient of the tangent — this is the initial rate of reaction. Gradient = change in the y-axis/change in x-axis. In this graph, it's: 40 cm³/8 s = 5 cm³/s.

If you're comparing the initial rate of reaction for two different reactions, you can work out the ratio of the rates to give you a quick and easy comparison. 

Practice Question
You are testing the effects of pH on the action of an enzyme. What other variables must you keep constant?

Exam Question
Q1: A student carries out an enzyme-controlled reaction at 37°C and 65°C.
Her results are shown in the graph above.
Draw a tangent to find the initial rate of reaction at 65°C. Show your working. [1 mark]

My rate of reaction depends on what time of day it is... In your exam, you could get asked about methods used to measure the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction or to calculate the rate from a graph. It's worth your time to memorize the examples and learn the math on these pages."
44,"@@@The Genetic Code and Nucleic Acids: Characteristics and Interpretation
The genetic code is exactly as it sounds—a code found in your genes that tells your body how to make proteins. It can be interpreted, just like any other code, which is exactly what you might have to do in your exam. The Genetic Code is non-overlapping, degenerate, and universal. 1) The genetic code is the sequence of base triplets (codons) in mRNA which code for specific amino acids. 2) In the genetic code, each base triplet is read in sequence, separate from the triplet before it and after it. Base triplets don't share their bases—the code is non-overlapping. Order of bases on mRNA: Base triplet (codon), Code read in sequence, mRNA base triplet, Amino acid, Order of amino acids in a protein, UCA = (serine). 3) The genetic code is also degenerate—there are more possible combinations of triplets than there are amino acids (20 amino acids but 64 possible triplets). This means that some amino acids are coded for by more than one base triplet, e.g. tyrosine can be coded for by UAU or UAC. 4) Some triplets are used to tell the cell when to start and stop production of the protein—these are called start and stop signals (or codons). They're found at the beginning and end of the mRNA. E.g., UAG is a stop signal. 5) The genetic code is also universal—the same specific base triplets code for the same amino acids in all living things. E.g., UAU codes for tyrosine in all organisms.

@@@How to Interpret Data about Nucleic Acids
You need to be able to interpret data about nucleic acids. The table on the right shows the mRNA codons (triplets) for some amino acids. You might have to interpret information like this in the exam. For example, using the table, you could be asked to give the DNA sequence for amino acids. The mRNA codons for the amino acids are given in the table. Because mRNA is a complementary copy of the DNA template, the DNA sequence for each amino acid is made up of bases that would pair with the mRNA sequence: mRNA codon, Amino Acid, DNA sequence (of the template strand), UCU (Serine) - AGA, CUA (Leucine) - GAT, etc. You could also be asked to work out the amino acids from a given DNA sequence and a table, write the amino acid sequence for a section of mRNA, or give the tRNA anticodons from mRNA codons. When interpreting data on nucleic acids, remember that DNA contains T and RNA contains U. To work out the sequence of amino acids from some mRNA, you need to break the genetic code into codons and then use the information in the table to work out what amino acid they code for. Sequence of mRNA: From mRNA: Codons: Amino acids (Example: Leucine, Valine, Arginine, Tyrosine, Serine).

@@@Investigating the Role of Nucleic Acids in Protein Synthesis
In the exam, you might have to interpret data from experiments done to investigate nucleic acids and their role in protein synthesis. Here's an example (you don't need to learn it): Investigating the effect of new drugs on nucleic acids: 1) To investigate how two new drugs affect nucleic acids and their role in protein synthesis, bacteria were grown in normal conditions for a few generations, then moved to media containing the drugs. 2) After a short period of time, the concentration of protein and complete strands of mRNA in the bacteria were analyzed. The results are shown in the bar graph. 3) Both mRNA and protein concentration were lower in the presence of drug 1 compared to the no-drug control. This suggests that drug 1 affects the production of full-length mRNA, so there's no mRNA for protein synthesis during translation. 4) mRNA production in the presence of drug 2 was unaffected, but less protein was produced. This suggests that drug 2 interferes with translation. mRNA was produced, but less protein was translated from it. 5) Further tests to establish the nature of the two drugs were carried out. Drug 1 was found to be a ribonuclease. Drug 2 was found to be a single-stranded, clover-shaped molecule capable of binding to the ribosome. 6) A molecule capable of binding to mRNA would have had a similar effect to drug 1 since it would have prevented mRNA from being read by the ribosomes and stopped it from being translated.

@@@Practice and Exam Questions on the Genetic Code
Practice Questions include mRNA codon and amino acid correlation, such as UGU (Cysteine), CGC (Arginine), etc. Example exam questions are provided to assess understanding of the genetic code, degeneracy, and universality, along with questions requiring translation of mRNA sequences and interpretation of results based on codon information. The key to the genetic code is to be able to interpret it, so knowledge of how DNA, mRNA, and tRNA work together to make a protein is essential for handling genetic code-related data. Remember DNA to RNA base pairing details such as C with C, and A with T (or U in the case of RNA)."
45,"@@@Meiosis and Genetic Variation: The Basics
Topic 4B — Diversity, Classification and Variation introduces the exciting concept of gametes—the sex cells referred to as sperm in males and eggs in females. These are crucial in sexual reproduction because they combine during fertilization to form a zygote, which then divides and develops into a new organism. Normal body cells contain a diploid number of chromosomes, which means there are two sets—one from each parent. However, gametes differ as they have a haploid number, just a single set of chromosomes. When a sperm fuses with an egg at fertilization, the resulting cell restores the normal diploid number, with equal contributions from both parents. This fusion not only blends parental DNA but also introduces genetic variation due to the random nature of fertilization, leading to offspring with different chromosomal combinations than their parents, thus increasing genetic diversity within a species.

@@@Meiosis: An Essential Process for Producing Gametes
Meiosis, a process occurring in the reproductive organs, reduces chromosome numbers by half to produce haploid cells from diploid ones. This halving is crucial to prevent doubling the chromosome count when gametes fuse. Meiosis involves DNA replication, forming chromatids, and two divisions—Meiosis I and Meiosis II. During Meiosis I, homologous chromosome pairs separate, and Meiosis II sees the splitting of sister chromatids, resulting in four genetically distinct haploid gametes. Knowing when and where meiosis occurs in various life cycles is important for understanding sexual reproduction in different organisms. The concept of homologous chromosome pairs is particularly poignant in humans, who have 23 such pairs, each containing one chromosome from each parent. Although these chromosomes carry the same genes, the alleles—different versions of those genes—may vary, providing further genetic diversity.

@@@Chromatid Exchange and Independent Segregation: Sources of Genetic Variation
During Meiosis I, a process called crossing over occurs where homologous chromosomes pair and exchange chromatid segments, leading to new allele combinations which create genetic diversity. Moreover, meiosis promotes variation through the random assortment of maternal and paternal chromosomes into gametes, known as independent segregation. This shuffling of genetic material results in daughter cells with unique combinations of chromosomes, further enriching genetic diversity. These two mechanisms are critical to the unique genetic outcomes for potential offspring.

@@@Contrasting Meiosis with Mitosis: Understanding Different Cell Division Outcomes
Contrasting meiosis with mitosis, which was discussed on page 32, highlights distinct differences in outcomes. In mitosis, a single cell division creates two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell, maintaining the same chromosome number. Meiosis, on the other hand, involves two division stages leading to four daughter cells that are genetically diverse and contain half the chromosomes of the parent cell. The absence of homologous chromosome pairing, crossing over, and independent segregation in mitosis accounts for the identical genetic makeup of daughter cells and differs significantly from the genetic variety produced by meiosis. Understanding these differences is fundamental when explaining the outcomes of these two forms of cell division."
46,"@@@Topic Overview: Diversity, Classification and Variation
Topic 4B dives into the intricacies of diversity, classification, and variation within organisms. This is primarily explored through the processes of meiosis and genetic variation, which are integral to sexual reproduction and the subsequent genetic uniqueness of individuals.

@@@Meiosis and Genetic Variation: Introduction
Ahh, now on to some really exciting stuff — the production of gametes (sex cells to you and me). This is how we end up different from our parents and our siblings — and yet, in some ways, strangely alike... DNA from one generation is passed to the next by gametes. Gametes are the sperm cells in males and egg cells in females. They join together at fertilization to form a zygote, which divides and develops into a new organism. Normal body cells have the diploid number (2n) of chromosomes — meaning each cell contains two of each chromosome, one from the mum and one from the dad. Gametes have a haploid (n) number of chromosomes — there's only one copy of each chromosome. At fertilization, a haploid sperm fuses with a haploid egg, making a cell with the normal diploid number of chromosomes. Half these chromosomes are from the father (the sperm) and half are from the mother (the egg). During sexual reproduction, any sperm can fertilize any egg. Fertilization is random and produces zygotes with different combinations of chromosomes to both parents. This mixing of genetic material in sexual reproduction increases genetic diversity within a species.

@@@The Process of Forming Gametes by Meiosis
Meiosis is a type of cell division that occurs in the reproductive organs. Diploid cells undergo meiosis to produce haploid gametes, ensuring that, upon fertilization, the resultant zygote maintains the species' specific chromosome number rather than doubling it. The steps of meiosis include DNA replication, chromosome condensation into homologous pairs, separation of these pairs during Meiosis I, and division of sister chromatids during Meiosis II, resulting in four genetically unique haploid cells. Understanding meiosis is crucial for recognizing its occurrence across various organisms' life cycles and predicting chromosomal compositions in offspring. This section also explains the concept of homologous chromosome pairs in humans, which consist of 46 chromosomes total, 23 from each parent.

@@@Increased Genetic Variation through Meiosis
Two critical events in meiosis-I lead to genetic variation: crossing over and independent segregation. During meiosis-I, homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange segments, resulting in chromatids with new allele combinations. Additionally, the random separation of these homologous chromosomes into daughter cells during meiosis-I ensures varied combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes, contributing to genetic diversity. Meiosis produces genetically distinct cells, unlike mitosis, which results in identical daughter cells. This distinction is vital for genetic diversity, evident in sexual reproduction, while mitosis is essential for growth and tissue repair.

@@@Chromosome Mutations and Disorders
Chromosome mutations can occur during cell division when meiosis malfunctions, causing daughter cells to have additional or missing chromosomes or chromosome parts. This can lead to inherited conditions, exemplified by non-disjunction, where chromosomes fail to separate correctly. For instance, non-disjunction of chromosome 21 can result in Down's Syndrome, characterized by an extra copy of chromosome 21 in the affected individual. Similarly, Turner syndrome in females is explained by non-disjunction of sex chromosomes leading to a single X chromosome instead of two.

@@@Practical Implementation and Exam Preparation
Practice and exam questions regarding topics like haploid and diploid concepts, meiosis mechanics, and outcomes of meiosis versus mitosis are provided to solidify the understanding of the subject. These questions aim to test the ability to define terms, explain processes, and apply knowledge to new scenarios such as non-human organisms. Such exercises prepare students for higher-level explorations of the topic and reinforce the core concepts explained throughout the text.

@@@Final Thoughts
Reproduction may not be as thrilling as it's portrayed to be, but understanding it is crucial for appreciating biological diversity. The processes of crossing over and independent segregation during meiosis are central to generating genetic variation and the subsequent richness of life. Diagrams and explanations throughout this section serve to demystify these complex processes and emphasize their importance in the continuity and evolution of life forms."
47,"@@@Introduction to Photosynthesis
Right, pen at the ready. Check. Brain switched on. Check. Cuppa piping hot. Check. Sweets on standby. Check. Okay, I think you're all sorted to start photosynthesis. Finally, take a deep breath and here we go...

@@@Chloroplast Structure and Function in Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis Takes Place in the Chloroplasts of Plant Cells
1) Chloroplasts are flattened organelles surrounded by a double membrane. They are found in plant cells.
2) Thylakoids (fluid-filled sacs) are stacked up in the chloroplast into structures called grana (singular = granum). The grana are linked together by bits of thylakoid membrane called lamellae (singular = lamella).
4) Chloroplasts contain photosynthetic pigments (e.g. chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotene). These are coloured substances that absorb the light energy needed for photosynthesis. The pigments are found in the thylakoid membranes — they're attached to proteins. The protein and pigment is called a photosystem.
5) There are two photosystems used by plants to capture light energy. Photosystem I (or PSI) absorbs light best at a wavelength of 700 nm and photosystem II (PSII) absorbs light best at 680 nm.
6) Contained within the inner membrane of the chloroplast and surrounding the thylakoids is a gel-like substance called the stroma. It contains enzymes, sugars and organic acids.
7) Carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis and not used straight away are stored as starch grains in the stroma.

@@@Two Stages of Photosynthesis: Light-Dependent Reactions and the Calvin Cycle
Photosynthesis can be Split into Two Stages
There are actually two stages that make up photosynthesis: crsmmammmm________cn- See p.' 108 for more*
1) As the name suggests, this reaction needs light energy.
2) It takes place in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts.
3) Here, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll (and other photosynthetic pigments) in the photosystems. The light energy excites the electrons in the chlorophyll, leading to their eventual release from the molecule. The chlorophyll has been photoionised.
4) Some of the energy from the released electrons is used to add a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP, and some is used to reduce NADP to form reduced NADP. ATP transfers energy and reduced NADP transfers hydrogen to the light-independent reaction.
5) During the process H2O is oxidised to O2.
The Light-Independent Reaction
1) This is also called the Calvin cycle and as the name suggests it doesn't use light energy directly. (But it does rely on the products of the light-dependent reaction.)
2) It takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast.
3) Here, the ATP and reduced NADP from the light-dependent reaction supply the energy and hydrogen to make simple sugars from CO2.

@@@The Light-Dependent Reaction: ATP Production by Photophosphorylation
In the Light-Dependent Reaction ATP is Made by Photophosphorylation
In the light-dependent reaction, the energy resulting from the photoionisation of chlorophyll is used for three things:
1) Making ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. This reaction is called photophosphorylation (see p. 105).
2) Making reduced NADP from NADP.
3) Splitting water into protons (H+ ions), electrons and oxygen. This is called photolysis (see p. 105).
The light-dependent reaction actually includes two types of photophosphorylation — non-cyclic and cyclic. Each of these processes has different products (see next page).

@@@Details on Photophosphorylation: Non-Cyclic and Cyclic
Non-cyclic Photophosphorylation Produces ATP, Reduced NADP and O2
To understand the process you need to know that the photosystems (in the thylakoid membranes) are linked by electron carriers. Electron carriers are proteins that transfer electrons. The photosystems and electron carriers form an electron transport chain — a chain of proteins through which excited electrons flow. All the processes in the diagrams are happening together — I've just split them up to make it easier to understand.
1) Light energy excites electrons in chlorophyll jLight energy is absorbed by PSII. The light energy excites electrons in chlorophyll. The electrons move to a higher energy level (i.e. they have more energy). These high-energy electrons are released from the chlorophyll and move down the electron transport chain to PSI.

The excited electrons lose energy as they move down the electron transport chain. This energy is used to transport protons into the thylakoid. So that the thylakoid has a higher concentration of protons than the stroma. This forms a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. Protons move down their concentration gradient, into the stroma, via the enzyme ATP synthase, which is embedded in the thylakoid membrane. The energy from this movement combines ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) to form ATP.

@@@Advancing Through the Calvin Cycle
Don't worry, you're over the worst of photosynthesis now. Instead of electrons flying around, there's a nice cycle of reactions to learn. What more could you want from life? Money, fast cars and nice clothes have nothing on this...
The Light-Independent Reaction is also called the Calvin Cycle
0.1' M 1 /1 I I | / y 1 /1 , 11 I | I~ The Calvin cycle is also - Z known as carbon dioxide Z- fixation because carbon from CO2 is 'fixed' into an organic molecule.
1) The Calvin cycle takes place in the stroma of the chloroplasts.
2) It makes a molecule called triose phosphate from CO2 and ribulose bisphosphate (a 5-carbon compound). Triose phosphate can be used to make glucose and other useful organic substances (see below).
3) There are a few steps in the cycle, and it needs ATP and H+ ions to keep it going.
4) The reactions are linked in a cycle, which means the starting compound, ribulose bisphosphate, is regenerated. Here's what happens at each stage in the cycle:
1) Carbon dioxide is combined with ribulose bisphosphate to form two molecules of glycerate 3-phosphate
- CO2 enters the leaf through the stomata and diffuses into the stroma of the chloroplast.
- Here, it's combined with ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), a 5-carbon compound. This reaction is catalysed by the enzyme rubisco.
- This gives an unstable 6-carbon compound, which quickly breaks down into two molecules of a 3-carbon compound called glycerate 3-phosphate (GP).

Five out of every six molecules of TP produced in the cycle aren't used to make hexose sugars, but to regenerate RuBP. Regenerating RuBP uses the rest of the ATP produced by the light-dependent reaction. The hydrolysis of ATP (from the light- dependent reaction) provides energy to turn the 3-carbon compound, GP, into a different 3-carbon compound called triose phosphate (TP). This reaction also requires H+ ions, which come from reduced NADP (also from the light-dependent reaction). Reduced NADP is recycled to NADP. Some triose phosphate is then converted into useful organic compounds (e.g. glucose) and some continues in the Calvin cycle to regenerate RuBP (see below).------------------------------'111111111111111  ~ Reduced NADP Z reduces GP to TP - — reduction Z reactions are explained on p. 105.''1 I i ' 11 n i i i i i i / i

@@@Conversion of Triose Phosphate Into Essential Organic Substances
TP and GP are Converted into Useful Organic Substances like Glucose
The Calvin cycle is the starting point for making all the organic substances a plant needs. Triose phosphate (TP) and glycerate 3-phosphate (GP) molecules are used to make carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids:
- Carbohydrates — hexose sugars (e.g. glucose) are made by joining two triose phosphate molecules together and larger carbohydrates (e.g. sucrose, starch, cellulose) are made by joining hexose sugars together in different ways.
- Lipids — these are made using glycerol, which is synthesised from triose phosphate, and fatty acids, which are synthesised from glycerate 3-phosphate.
- Amino acids — some amino acids are made from glycerate 3-phosphate. Topic 5A — Photosynthesis and Respiration

@@@The Efficiency of the Calvin Cycle and Production of Hexose Sugars
The Calvin Cycle Needs to Turn Six Times to Make One Hexose Sugar
Here's the reason why:
1) Three turns of the cycle produces six molecules of triose phosphate (TP), because two molecules of TP are made for every one CO2 molecule used.
2) Five out of six of these TP molecules are used to regenerate ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP).
3) This means that for three turns of the cycle only one TP is produced that's used to make a hexose sugar.
4) A hexose sugar has six carbons though, so two TP molecules are needed to form one hexose sugar.
5) This means the cycle must turn six times to produce two molecules of TP that can be used to make one hexose sugar.
6) Six turns of the cycle need 18 ATP and 12 reduced NADP from the light-dependent reaction.
This might seem a bit inefficient, but it keeps the cycle going and makes sure there's always enough RuBP ready to combine with CO2 taken in from the atmosphere.

48,"@@@Introduction to Respiration
Respiration is a fundamental process that you, along with many other living organisms, engage in to produce energy. This text will guide you through the intricate reactions involved in respiration. You'll be introduced to two primary types of respiration: aerobic, which requires oxygen, and anaerobic, which does not require oxygen. Both pathways begin with glycolysis, a process through which glucose is converted into pyruvate, setting the stage for either aerobic or anaerobic respiration.

@@@Overview of Glycolysis and Pyruvate Formation
The process of glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm and involves the breakdown of glucose (a 6-carbon molecule) into two molecules of pyruvate (each with 3 carbons). This process occurs without the need for oxygen, thus being an anaerobic process, and results in a net gain of ATP and reduced NAD. Glycolysis itself can be broken down into two stages: phosphorylation and oxidation. Through these stages, ATP and reduced NAD are generated, and pyruvate, a crucial molecule for the subsequent pathways, is produced.

@@@Distinguishing Aerobic and Anaerobic Respiration
In aerobic respiration, the generated pyruvate is transported into the mitochondrial matrix, where it undergoes further reactions. These include the link reaction, which converts pyruvate into acetyl coenzyme A, and the Krebs cycle, which produces additional energy carriers. During anaerobic respiration, pyruvate is not transported to the mitochondria but instead is converted to either ethanol or lactate, allowing for the continuation of glycolysis and a small but critical production of ATP.

@@@Further Stages of Aerobic Respiration: Link Reaction and Krebs Cycle
The aerobic respiration process continues with the link reaction, where pyruvate is converted into acetyl coenzyme A, and then enters the Krebs cycle. The Krebs cycle is a set of reactions that take place in the mitochondria, involving further decarboxylation and dehydrogenation. The Krebs cycle turns twice for each glucose molecule and generates reduced coenzymes and ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation.

@@@Oxidative Phosphorylation and ATP Production
Oxidative phosphorylation is the final stage of aerobic respiration where considerable amounts of ATP are produced. This stage encompasses the electron transport chain and chemiosmosis, which use the energy derived from reduced coenzymes to synthesize ATP. Specifically, protons are pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane and their subsequent flow back into the matrix via ATP synthase generates ATP. Oxygen serves as the final electron acceptor in the chain.

@@@Efficiency of Aerobic Respiration and Final ATP Yield
An overall view of aerobic respiration reveals that a single molecule of glucose can yield up to 32 molecules of ATP. This efficiency is due to the series of reactions that precisely produce energy carriers and ATP at different stages: glycolysis, the link reaction, and the Krebs cycle. However, the exact number of ATP molecules generated can vary, with recent research suggesting that each reduced NAD and FAD contributes to slightly fewer ATP molecules than previously thought.

@@@Impact of Mitochondrial Diseases and Alternative Respiratory Substrates
Mitochondrial diseases, which impair the function of oxidative phosphorylation or the Krebs cycle, can lead to a reduction in ATP production. This may result in an increased reliance on anaerobic respiration and the accumulation of lactate, causing muscle fatigue, weakness, and elevated lactate levels in the bloodstream. Additionally, aerobic respiration can utilize compounds other than glucose, such as products from the breakdown of lipids and proteins.

@@@Practical Applications of Respiration Knowledge
Understanding respiration at the cellular level is not only crucial for academic success but also has practical implications, such as explaining lactate buildup in muscle cells after a sprint or how substances like carbon monoxide can impair ATP production. Exam preparation involves mastering the details of these biochemical processes.

@@@Study Tips and Encouragement
As daunting as the study of respiration chemistry may seem, perseverance and repeated review will ensure you grasp the material. Encouragement is extended to keep at it, with the reminder that this knowledge is not only necessary for exams but also serves as a stepping stone to greater achievements."
49,"@@@Proteins: Introduction and Amino Acid Building Blocks
There are loads of different proteins with loads of different functions. But what are proteins? What do they look like? Well, for your enjoyment, here are the answers to all those questions and many, many more... Proteins are made from long chains of amino acids. 1) The monomers of proteins are amino acids. 2) A dipeptide is formed when two amino acids join together. 3) A polypeptide is formed when more than two amino acids join together. 4) Proteins are made up of one or more polypeptides. Grant's cries of ""die peptide, die"" could be heard for miles around. He'd never forgiven it for sleeping with his wife. Different amino acids have different variable groups. Amino acids have the same general structure — a carboxyl group (-COOH), an amine or amino group (-NH2) and an R group (also known as a variable side group).

@@@Amino Acid Diversity and Polypeptide Formation
Structure of an Amino Acid: R ^—variable group IH, N — C COOH \group carboxyl group All living things share a bank of only 20 amino acids. The only difference between them is what makes up their R group. E.g. Structure of Alanine CH3 IH N - C — COOH IH ^v*''11'11'11 u 1>1, // - Glycine is the only amino acid that doesn't have carbon in its side group. Its R group consists of just one hydrogen atom. Amino acids are linked together by condensation reactions to form polypeptides. A molecule of water is released during the reaction. The bonds formed between amino acids are called peptide bonds. The reverse reaction happens during digestion. Amino acid 1 RI - c - IHH - amino acid 2 RI - c - IH condensation COOH CQOH \ + Na molecule of water is formed during condensation.

@@@Protein Structure: Primary to Quaternary
Proteins Have Four Structural Levels: Proteins are big, complicated molecules. They're much easier to explain if you describe their structure in four 'levels'. These levels are a protein's primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures. Primary Structure — this is the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain. Secondary Structure — the polypeptide chain doesn't remain flat and straight. Hydrogen bonds form between the amino acids in the chain. This makes it automatically coil into an alpha (α) helix or fold into a beta (β) pleated sheet — this is the secondary structure. Tertiary Structure — the coiled or folded chain of amino acids is often coiled and folded further. More bonds form between different parts of the polypeptide chain, including hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds (attractions between negative and positive charges on different parts of the molecule). Disulfide bridges also form whenever two molecules of the amino acid cysteine come close together — the sulfur atom in one cysteine bonds to the sulfur atom in the other. For proteins made from a single polypeptide chain, the tertiary structure forms their final 3D structure. Quaternary Structure — some proteins are made of several different polypeptide chains held together by bonds. The quaternary structure is the way these polypeptide chains are assembled together. For proteins made from more than one polypeptide chain (e.g. haemoglobin, insulin, collagen), the quaternary structure is the protein's final 3D structure.

@@@Topic Classification
Topic 1A — Biological Molecules"
50,"@@@Introduction to Nervous Coordination and Neurones
Topic 6B covers the essential aspects of nervous coordination, focusing on the roles and behaviors of neurones. The section starts with a light-hearted call to action, suggesting that the reader should have their notepad ready to explore the fascinating world of motor neurones and the intricate process of action potentials.

@@@Resting Potential and Membrane Polarization
Neurone cell membranes exhibit polarization at rest, characterized by a positive charge outside compared to the inside, owing to the difference in the distribution of positive ions. This polarization creates a potential difference or voltage across the membrane known as resting potential, typically around -70 mV. This state is actively maintained by the sodium-potassium pumps and potassium ion channels, making use of active transport and facilitated diffusion, respectively.

@@@Action Potential and Neurone Stimulation
The process of action potential begins when a stimulus prompts sodium ion channels to open, allowing sodium ions to flood into a neurone. If the stimulus reaches a certain threshold, it results in a rapid change in potential difference, characterized by depolarization, followed by repolarization, and potentially leading to hyperpolarization. This series of events is integral for the transmission of nerve impulses, where the action potential cannot immediately reoccur due to the refractory period during which ion channels recover.

@@@Wave of Depolarization and Refractory Period
An action potential triggers a wave of depolarization that travels along the neurone as sodium ions induce subsequent regions of the neurone to experience the same influx. Meanwhile, the refractory period ensures that action potentials are discrete, imposing limits on impulse frequency and guaranteeing unidirectional travel.

@@@All-or-Nothing Principle of Action Potentials
The all-or-nothing nature of action potentials signifies that once the stimulus crosses the threshold, an action potential will launch consistently regardless of stimulus intensity, while sub-threshold stimuli will not generate an action potential. Larger stimuli result in more frequent action potentials rather than stronger ones.

@@@Factors Influencing the Speed of Conduction
The text outlines three main factors affecting the speed at which action potentials are conducted: myelination, axon diameter, and temperature. Myelinated neurones feature a myelin sheath, allowing fast saltatory conduction, whereas non-myelinated neurones experience a slower impulse transmission along the axon. Larger axon diameters present less resistance to ion flow, resulting in quicker depolarization. The conduction speed also typically increases with temperature up to a certain point, after which protein denaturation hampers the speed.

@@@Practice and Exam Questions on Nervous Coordination
Toward the end of the section, practice questions are presented to test understanding of the refractory period, the all-or-nothing nature of action potentials, the function of Schwann cells, and factors affecting conduction speed. An exam question follows, which includes a detailed graph displaying the changes in an action potential over time, with sub-questions probing the reader to explain specific changes and calculate the number of action potentials over a given period.

@@@Recap and Encouragement for Understanding Neurones
In closing, the text provides encouragement for readers dealing with the complexity of neurone behavior. It emphasizes the importance of electrical charges across neurone membranes initiated by ion pumps and suggests that writing out the information can help solidify the concepts involved in transmitting an action potential. The text focuses on how these electrical charges help to propagate action potentials."
51,"@@@ Overview of Synaptic Transmission and Synapse Structure
139Synaptic Transmission—When an action potential arrives at the end of a neurone, the information has to be passed on to the next cell, which could be another neurone, a muscle cell, or a gland cell. A synapse is the junction between two cells which facilitates this transmission. This includes:
- Synapses between neurons, or neurons and effector cells like muscles or gland cells.
- The synaptic cleft which is the tiny gap between cells at a synapse.
- The presynaptic neurone with its synaptic knob containing vesicles filled with neurotransmitters.
- The process of neurotransmitters being released into the cleft when an action potential arrives, which then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.
- The potential effects on the postsynaptic cell, which could be the generation of a new action potential, muscle contraction, or hormone secretion.
- Synapses ensure unidirectionality of the impulse and are subject to mechanisms ensuring neurotransmitters are removed from the synaptic cleft to prevent continuous activity.
- Examples of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine (ACh) and noradrenaline, with cholinergic synapses using acetylcholine.
- A diagram illustrating the typical structure of a synapse including synaptic knob, vesicles, synaptic cleft, and receptors.

@@@ Cholinergic Synapse Transmission Mechanics
ACh Transmits the Nerve Impulse Across a Cholinergic Synapse—The transmission process detailed from the arrival of an action potential at the synaptic knob of the presynaptic neurone, including:
- Stimulation of voltage-gated calcium ion channels.
- Calcium ion influx leading to the movement and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane.
- Release and diffusion of acetylcholine across the synaptic cleft and binding to cholinergic receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.
- Sodium ion channels opening in response, potentially causing an action potential if the threshold is met.
- The breakdown of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase to prevent continuous signaling.
- A representation of the entire process in the cholinergic synapse, its specific receptors, and enzyme interactions.

@@@ Modulation of Synaptic Response and Neuromuscular Junctions
140Synaptic Transmission—The next section discusses the nature of neurotransmitters and their varying impacts on synaptic transmission, including:
- Excitatory neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, which depolarize the postsynaptic membrane and can induce an action potential.
- Inhibitory neurotransmitters, which hyperpolarize the postsynaptic membrane preventing an action potential.
- The concept of summation, both spatial and temporal, which allows for a cumulation of signals to potentially reach a threshold for an action potential.
- The specific case of neuromuscular junctions, which are synapses between motor neurons and muscle cells, how they operate like cholinergic synapses, and their unique features.
- Both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the context of whether they collectively can or cannot cause an action potential.

@@@ Effects of Drugs on Synaptic Function and Review Questions
141Synaptic Transmission—Elaborates on how various drugs can influence synaptic transmission through mechanisms like:
- Agonists, mimicking neurotransmitters, activate more receptors (e.g., nicotine).
- Antagonists, blocking receptors and preventing activation by neurotransmitters (e.g., curare).
- Enzyme inhibitors, which prevent neurotransmitter breakdown leading to prolonged receptor activation (e.g., nerve gases).
- Drugs that stimulate or inhibit neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neurone (e.g., amphetamines, alcohol).
- Practice and exam questions that test understanding of unidirectionality at synapses, neurotransmitter removal mechanisms, the role of calcium ions, types of neurotransmitters, and the identification of neuromuscular receptor types.
- A graph depicting potential difference across a postsynaptic membrane and related analysis questions.

52,"@@@Introduction to Genetic Inheritance
Topic 7A — GeneticsInheritance begins with an attention-grabbing jest about genetic inheritance not being related to who inherits family heirlooms like ""Mum's best china."" Instead, it's a segue into the topic of genetic inheritance, which refers to the process by which genes and characteristics are passed down from parents to offspring.

@@@Key Genetic Terms and Definitions
A list of essential genetic terms is provided for a fundamental understanding of genetics. The terms include Gene, Allele, Genotype, Phenotype, Dominant, Recessive, Codominant, Locus, Homozygote, Heterozygote, and Carrier. Each term is diligently defined to give clarity on their individual roles and implications in genetics.

@@@Understanding Genetic Diagrams and Monohybrid Crosses 
This section discusses how genetic diagrams, also known as Punnett squares, are used to show the potential genotypes of offspring. It elaborates on the process involving diploid organisms, gametes, and the concept of monohybrid inheritance, which is the inheritance of a characteristic controlled by a single gene. The inheritance of wing length in fruit flies is highlighted as an example, showing how dominant and recessive alleles interact across generations.

@@@Punnett Square Illustration and Codominance
The Punnett square is further explained, offering a step-by-step guide on determining the F1 and F2 generation outcomes in a genetic cross. It exemplifies inheritance patterns using seed texture and color in pea plants as a case study. Furthermore, codominance is explained through the example of sickle-cell anaemia, showcasing how heterozygotes express both alleles in the phenotype.

@@@Complexities of Multiple Alleles and Blood Type Inheritance
Here we delve into the complexities arising when a gene has multiple alleles, as opposed to a simple dominant-recessive relationship. The ABO blood group system is cited, explaining how the three alleles for blood type interact, resulting in different blood groups. The section highlights how diverse genotypes can lead to a variety of phenotypes within a population.

@@@Dihybrid Crosses and Phenotypic Ratio Predictions
The focus is on dihybrid crosses that simultaneously examine inheritance patterns for two different genes. Genetic diagrams for dihybrid crosses are introduced, illustrating how different combinations of alleles can lead to varying observed phenotypic ratios among offspring, with the pea plant seeds' texture and color used as the model.

@@@Summarizing Different Types of Genetic Crosses and Phenotypic Ratios
A summary provides a concise overview of typical phenotypic ratios that result from monohybrid, dihybrid, and codominant crosses. This part also acknowledges that real-world genetic outcomes may not always align with theoretical predictions due to factors like sex linkage, autosomal linkage, or epistasis.

@@@Practical Application and Exam Practice
Tying it all together, this section provides practice and exam-style questions to apply the theoretical knowledge of genetics. It reinforces the concepts of genotype, phenotype, and the functions of dihybrid crosses. Theoretical understanding is tested with sample questions on pea plant genetics and the inheritance of coat color in cows, inviting readers to draw genetic diagrams to illustrate their understanding.
  
@@@Conclusion and Encouragement for Learning Genetics
In a light-hearted closing remark, the reader is encouraged not to despair despite the complexity and volume of terms in genetics. The narrative assures that with a solid understanding of key terms and the workings of genetic diagrams, the subject matter will all ""fall into place."""
53,"@@@Understanding Sex-Linked Characteristics
Right, this stuff is fairly hard, so if you don't get it first time don't panic, just work through it again until you do. Some characteristics are sex-linked. The genetic information for gender is carried on two sex chromosomes. In mammals, females have two X chromosomes (XX) and males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). A characteristic is said to be sex-linked when the allele that codes for it is located on a sex chromosome. The Y chromosome is smaller than the X chromosome and carries fewer genes. So most genes on the sex chromosomes are only carried on the X chromosome (called X-linked genes). As males only have one X chromosome, they often only have one allele for sex-linked genes. So, because they only have one copy, they express the characteristic of this allele even if it's recessive. This makes males more likely than females to show recessive phenotypes for genes that are sex-linked. Genetic disorders caused by faulty alleles on sex chromosomes include color blindness and hemophilia. The faulty alleles for both of these disorders are carried on the X chromosome — they're called X-linked disorders. 

Example of Sex-Linked Inheritance
Colour blindness is a sex-linked disorder caused by a faulty allele carried on the X chromosome. As it's sex-linked, both the chromosome and the allele are represented in the genetic diagram, e.g. Xn, where X represents the X chromosome and n the faulty allele for color vision. The Y chromosome doesn't have an allele for color vision so is just represented by Y. Females would need two copies of the recessive allele to be color blind, while males only need one copy. This means color blindness is much rarer in women than men. In the example of genetic diagram, there's a 3 : 1 ratio of offspring without color blindness: offspring with color blindness. But when a female carrier and a male without color-blindness have children (as in this example), only their male offspring are at risk of being color-blind. So you can also say that there's a predicted 2:1:1 ratio — of female offspring without color-blindness: male offspring without color-blindness: male offspring with color-blindness. This ratio will change if a female carrier (XNXn) and a male with color-blindness (XnY) have children. The predicted ratio will then be 1 : 1 — of offspring with color-blindness: offspring without color-blindness. The ratio will be the same for offspring of each gender. You only end up with this predicted ratio for a monohybrid F1 cross with a sex-linked characteristic.

@@@Autosomal Genes and Linkage
Autosome is the fancy name for any chromosome that isn't a sex chromosome. Autosomal genes are the genes located on the autosomes. Genes on the same autosome are said to be linked — because they're on the same autosome they'll stay together during the independent segregation of chromosomes in meiosis I, and their alleles will be passed on to the offspring together. The only reason this won't happen is if crossing over splits them up first. The closer together two genes are on the autosome, the more closely they are said to be linked. If two genes are autosomally linked, you won't get the phenotypic ratio you expect in the offspring of a cross. For example, in a dihybrid cross between two heterozygous parents you'd expect a 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 ratio in the offspring. Instead, the phenotypic ratio is more likely to be that expected for a monohybrid cross between two heterozygous parents (3:1) because the two autosomally-linked alleles are inherited together. This means that a higher proportion of the offspring will have their parents' (heterozygous) genotype and phenotype. This allows you to use the predicted phenotypic ratio to identify autosomal linkage.

@@@Genetic Cross Results Can Show Autosomal Linkage
In the exam, you might get some genetic cross results that show linkage and have to explain them. A scientist was investigating linkage between the genes for eye color and wing length in fruit flies. The gene for normal wings (N) is dominant to the gene for vestigial wings (n), and the gene for red eyes (R) is dominant to the gene for purple eyes (r). The first cross the scientist carried out was between flies homozygous dominant for both normal wings and red eyes (NNRR) and flies homozygous recessive for both vestigial wings and purple eyes (nnrr). The resulting offspring were all heterozygous for normal wings and red eyes (NnRr). The second cross the scientist carried out was between these offspring (NnRr) and the flies homozygous recessive for vestigial wings and purple eyes (nnrr). He expected a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, the results he got for this cross showed an 8:1:1:8 ratio. In order for the NnRr and nnrr genotypes to be so common in the offspring, the NR alleles and the nr alleles in the NnRr parent must have been linked. This means that the NnRr parent produced mostly NR and nr gametes. Some Nr and nR gametes were still made due to crossing over, but there were fewer Nnrr and nnRr offspring overall. As a result, a higher proportion of the offspring have their parents' phenotypes.

@@@Epistatic Gene Interaction
Many different genes can control the same characteristic — they interact to form the phenotype. This can be because the allele of one gene masks (blocks) the expression of the alleles of other genes — this is called epistasis. For instance, in humans, a widow's peak (see picture) is controlled by one gene and baldness by others. If you have the alleles that code for baldness, it doesn't matter whether you have the allele for a widow's peak or not, as you have no hair. The baldness genes are epistatic to the widow's peak gene, as the baldness genes mask the expression of the widow's peak gene. Similarly, flower pigment in a plant is controlled by two genes. Gene 1 codes for a yellow pigment (Y is the dominant yellow allele) and gene 2 codes for an enzyme that turns the yellow pigment orange (R is the dominant orange allele). If you don't have the Y allele, it won't matter if you have the R allele or not as the flower will be colorless. Gene 1 is epistatic to gene 2 as it can mask the expression of gene 2. Crosses involving epistatic genes don't result in the expected phenotypic ratios.

@@@Predicting Phenotypic Ratios involving Epistatic Genes
Just as you can predict the phenotypic ratios for a normal dihybrid cross, you can predict the phenotypic ratios for dihybrid crosses involving some epistatic genes too. A dihybrid cross involving a recessive epistatic allele results in a phenotypic ratio of 9:3:4, where having two copies of the recessive epistatic allele masks (blocks) the expression of the other gene. For example, crossing a homozygous recessive parent with a homozygous dominant parent will result in this ratio among the F2 generation. A dihybrid cross involving a dominant epistatic allele yields a 12:3:1 ratio. Having at least one copy of the dominant epistatic allele masks the other gene. So, crossing parents with specific homozygous recessive and homozygous dominant genotypes will produce this outcome in the F2 generation. Squash color is an example of this, where a dominant epistatic allele controls the presence of color and another gene controls the actual color expressed. Practice questions at the end can help reinforce the understanding of the concepts, including sex-linked characteristics, autosomal linkage, and epistasis.

@@@Epistasis in Practice Questions and Exam Questions
Q1 asks about the nature of a sex-linked characteristic. Q2 seeks an explanation of autosomally-linked genes. Q3 inquires about the definition of an epistatic gene. Q4 examines the implications of a dihybrid cross resulting in a 9:3:4 phenotypic ratio in the F1 generation. The exam questions provide further practical applications of these genetic concepts, asking for genetic diagrams and explanations for patterns of inheritance, such as the prevalence of hemophilia in males and the outcome of crosses involving different hair types in a hypothetical organism A. These tests demonstrate how theoretical genetic principles are turned into questions analyzing students' comprehension and application.

@@@Humor in Genetic Understanding
Lastly, a lighthearted comment suggests that biology students expect a 9:1 phenotypic ratio of normal to geek. This quip may serve to lighten the mood after dense information, reflecting a bit of humor sometimes inserted into teaching materials to keep students engaged. As epistasis is acknowledged to be tricky, it reinforces the importance of understanding key principles and being able to navigate through complex genetic concepts."
54,"@@@Overview of DNA and RNA
These two pages are all about nucleic acids — DNA and RNA. These molecules are needed to build proteins, which are required for the cells in living organisms to function. They're right handy little things.

@@@The Function of DNA and RNA
DNA and RNA Carry Important Information
DNA and RNA are both types of nucleic acid. They're found in all living cells and they both carry information. 1) DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is used to store genetic information — that's all the instructions an organism needs to grow and develop from a fertilised egg to a fully grown adult. 2) RNA (ribonucleic acid) is similar in structure to DNA. One of its main functions is to transfer genetic information from the DNA to the ribosomes. Ribosomes are the body's 'protein factories' — they read the RNA to make polypeptides (proteins) in a process called translation (see p. 85). Ribosomes themselves are made from RNA and proteins.

@@@Nucleotides: The Building Blocks
DNA and RNA are Polymers of Nucleotides
1) A nucleotide is a type of biological molecule. It's made from:
- a pentose sugar (that's a sugar with 5 carbon atoms),
- a nitrogen-containing organic base, Organic' means that it contains carbon.
2) Nucleotides are really important. For a start, they're the monomers (see p. 2) that make up DNA and RNA.

@@@Different Sugars in DNA and RNA
The Sugar Differences Between DNA and RNA
The Sugar in DNA is Called Deoxyribose
1) The pentose sugar in a DNA nucleotide is called deoxyribose. 2) Each DNA nucleotide has the same sugar and a phosphate group. The base on each nucleotide can vary though. 3) There are four possible bases — adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C) and guanine (G).
The Sugar in RNA is Called Ribose
1) RNA contains nucleotides with a ribose sugar (not deoxyribose). 2) Like DNA, an RNA nucleotide also has a phosphate group and one of four different bases. 3) In RNA though, uracil (U) replaces thymine as a base.

Mary didn't care if it was ribose or deoxyribose, she just wanted her cuppa.

@@@Formation of Polynucleotides
Nucleotides Join Together to Form Polynucleotides
1) A polynucleotide is a polymer of nucleotides. Both DNA and RNA nucleotides form polynucleotides. 2) The nucleotides join up via a condensation reaction (see p. 2) between the phosphate group of one nucleotide and the sugar of another. 3) This forms a phosphodiester bond (consisting of the phosphate group and two ester bonds). 4) The chain of sugars and phosphates is known as the sugar-phosphate backbone.

@@@Structure of DNA
DNA's Unique Double-Helix
DNA is Made of Two Polynucleotide Chains in a Double-Helix Structure
1) Two DNA polynucleotide strands join together by hydrogen bonding between the bases. 2) Each base can only join with one particular partner — this is called complementary base pairing (or specific base pairing). 3) Adenine always pairs with thymine (A -T) and cytosine always pairs with guanine (C - G). This means that there are always equal amounts of adenine and thymine in a DNA molecule and equal amounts of cytosine and guanine. 4) Two hydrogen bonds form between A and T, and three hydrogen bonds form between C and G. 5) Two antiparallel (running in opposite directions) polynucleotide strands twist to form the DNA double-helix.

@@@RNA's Structure and Role
RNA is a Relatively Short Polynucleotide Chain
RNA is made from a single polynucleotide chain (not a double one). It's much shorter than most DNA polynucleotides.

@@@Understanding the Genetic Code Carriers
DNA and genetic information
6) DNA was first observed in the 1800s, but lots of scientists at the time doubted that it could carry the genetic code because it has a relatively simple chemical composition. Some argued that genetic information must be carried by proteins — which are much more chemically varied. 7) By 1953, experiments had shown that DNA was the carrier of the genetic code. This was also the year in which the double-helix structure, which helps DNA to carry out its function, was determined by Watson and Crick.

All these specialized cell types originally came from stem cells. Stem cells are unspecialized cells that can develop into other types of cell. They divide to become new cells, which then become specialized. All multicellular organisms have some form of stem cell. Stem cells are found in the embryo (where they become all the specialized cells needed to form a fetus) and in some adult tissues (where they become specialized cells that need to be replaced, for instance, stem cells in the intestines constantly replace intestinal epithelial cells). Totipotent stem cells are able to mature into any type of body cell in an organism, including the cells that make up the placenta in mammals. Totipotent stem cells are only present in mammals in the first few cell divisions of an embryo. Later, embryonic stem cells become pluripotent; they can still specialize into any cell in the body but lose the ability to become the cells that make up the placenta. Adult mammals have either multipotent or unipotent stem cells. Multipotent stem cells can differentiate into a few different types of cells, while unipotent stem cells can only differentiate into one type of cell.

@@@Mechanisms of Cell Specialization in Stem Cells
Stem cells become specialized due to the selective expression of their genes during development. All stem cells contain the same genes, but not all genes are transcribed and translated (expressed). Transcription is when DNA is copied into mRNA, and translation is when proteins are produced using the code in mRNA. Under the right conditions, some genes are expressed and others are turned off. mRNA is only transcribed from specific genes, which is then translated into proteins that alter the cell. These proteins determine cell structure and control cellular processes, leading to a specialized cell. An example given is the production of red blood cells from bone marrow stem cells, which involves expressing the genes needed for hemoglobin production and for removing the nucleus.

@@@Cardiomyocytes Derived from Unipotent Stem Cells
Cardiomyocytes, the heart muscle cells, are thought to be unable to replicate themselves in mature mammals, leading to the belief that heart cells can't regenerate, causing issues when the heart is damaged. Nevertheless, some scientists believe that cardiomyocytes can be replaced by new ones derived from a limited supply of unipotent stem cells in the heart. Research varies on how quickly this regeneration process occurs, with some suggesting it could be a slow process, while others believe it happens more frequently.

@@@Therapeutic Applications of Stem Cells
Stem cells hold potential to treat a variety of human disorders due to their ability to differentiate into a range of specialized cell types. Existing therapies using stem cells include treatments for diseases affecting the blood and immune system, such as bone marrow transplants for leukemia and lymphoma, as well as genetic disorders like sickle-cell anemia and SCID. Research is ongoing for the use of stem cells in treating spinal cord injuries, heart disease, bladder conditions, respiratory diseases, and even growing organs for transplant.

@@@Advances in Stem Cell Types and Sources
With the need for stem cells in the medical field, scientists extract them from various sources. Adult stem cells, although limited in differentiation capabilities, can be obtained from adult tissue through simple operations. Embryonic stem cells, derived from early-stage embryos, offer a more versatile range of cell specialization but raise ethical concerns due to the destruction of embryos. To mitigate ethical issues, scientists have developed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) by reprogramming specialized adult body cells to pluripotency, a method that may prove useful in research and medicine.

@@@Ethical Considerations in the Use of Embryonic Stem Cells
The procurement of embryonic stem cells through IVF involves the destruction of embryos, prompting ethical debates. Some believe that embryos have the right to life from the moment of fertilization, making it wrong to destroy them, while others have fewer qualms if the embryos are unfertilized and unviable in the long term. The production of adult stem cells, which does not involve embryo destruction, is a preferable alternative for some, although it limits the range of cell types that can be formed. Induced pluripotent stem cells represent a promising development without the ethical issues associated with embryonic stem cells, as they are reprogrammed from adult tissue.

@@@Conclusion: The Potential of Stem Cells in Medicine
Stem cells could significantly impact the medical field by saving lives, improving the quality of life, and offering treatment options for various conditions. Societal decision-makers must balance the pros and cons, scientific advancements, and ethical considerations when implementing stem cell research and therapies. It is crucial for individuals to understand these factors for an informed perspective on the use of stem cells in medical treatments.

56,"@@@Overview of Recombinant DNA Technology and Its Practical Applications
Using recombinant DNA technology, scientists can manipulate genetic material in order to modify microorganisms, plants, and animals; this practice is known as genetic engineering or genetic modification (GM). Through this technology, microorganisms can be transformed to produce useful proteins, such as insulin, via in vivo cloning. Similar techniques are applied to plants and animals, enabling the expression of desirable proteins by introducing foreign genes into plasmids used as vectors. The correct promoter regions are necessary to ensure the expression of these proteins in the transformed species. In animals, such genetic modification can occur at the embryonic stage for uniform gene expression across all body cells or can be targeted to specific cell types to ease harvesting or to avoid potential damage to the organism from inappropriate protein production.

@@@The Benefits of Recombinant DNA for Humanity
Recombinant DNA technology holds significant promise for various applications that directly benefit humans. In agriculture, modified crops can lead to higher yields, enhanced nutritional value, and resistance to pests, reducing the likelihood of famine and malnutrition, as well as minimizing the ecological impact of pesticides. An example of this is Golden Rice, which has been developed to combat vitamin A deficiency. Industry benefits as well, with enzymes for processes such as cheese-making now being produced from transformed organisms more efficiently and ethically. Medicine has seen advances due to recombinant DNA technology with faster, more affordable manufacture of drugs and vaccines, represented by the production of synthetic human insulin that is more effective than insulin derived from animals.

@@@Ethical, Financial, and Social Issues Surrounding Recombinant DNA
Despite the numerous benefits of recombinant DNA technology, there are also significant ethical, financial, and social concerns. Agricultural practices like the monoculture of transformed crops raise apprehensions about increased susceptibility to diseases and loss of biodiversity. The threat of herbal resistance due to gene transfer from transformed crops to wild plant species, and the potential contamination of organic crops with GM seeds poses problems for organic farmers and biodiversity. In industry, the domination of a few large biotechnology companies stirs anti-globalization sentiments, as they can outcompete smaller businesses, stifle consumer choice, and introduce economic challenges in markets like the EU that reject GM foods. Medical issues include the potential limitation on life-saving technologies by patent-holding companies and the misuse of genetic engineering, such as in the controversial idea of designer babies. Furthermore, there are debates around the ownership of genetic material and the implications of seed patents held by corporations on farmers and the legal system.

@@@Potential Humanitarian Impact of Recombinant DNA Technology
Contrasting with the above concerns, many see recombinant DNA technology as a path to humanitarian advances. These include the development of crops resistant to environmental stresses like drought, using transformed crops as bioreactors to produce pharmaceuticals, and the cheaper production of medicines. Additionally, gene therapy, a direct application of recombinant DNA technology to human health, holds promise for treating or curing genetic disorders and cancer, provided ethical dilemmas can be addressed and managed effectively.

@@@Gene Therapy as a Recombinant DNA Application
Gene therapy represents a cutting-edge use of recombinant DNA technology to treat genetic disorders and cancer by altering mutated genes. The specific strategies used in gene therapy are contingent on the type of genetic disorder present. Gene therapy can be classified into two types: somatic therapy, which aims to correct genetic anomalies in body cells and does not affect offspring, and germ line therapy, which alters reproductive cells to prevent the passing down of a disease—but is currently illegal in humans. Various methods, including vectors like viruses, plasmids, or liposomes, are employed to insert beneficial alleles into cells. There are high hopes for gene therapy in the medical community, albeit the technology remains in its early stages and involves numerous ethical considerations.

@@@Case Study and Exam Preparation for Recombinant DNA Topics
Questions are presented to students in order to test their understanding of transformed organisms, financial issues of recombinant DNA technology in industry, and gene therapy. An additional case study provides a scenario for applying recombinant DNA technology to enhance drought resistance in wheat, asking students to explain the transformation process, its potential benefits, and the possible objections from anti-globalization activists. Examination preparation also involves pondering the societal implications of recombinant DNA technology, fostering a comprehensive understanding of the topic's various facets for academic success."
57,"@@@Processing and Presenting Data: The Essentials of Data Interpretation
Processing data means taking raw data and doing some calculations with it, to make it more useful. Processing the Data Helps You to Interpret it. You Need to be Able to Calculate Percentage Change and Ratios. Calculating percentage change helps to quantify how much something has changed, e.g. the percentage change in the growth rate of pea plants when a fertiliser is added. To calculate it, you use this equation: 
Percentage change = (final value - original value) / original value x 100
A positive value shows an increase, and a negative value shows a decrease. For example, a person's blood glucose concentration before a meal was 4.2 mmol dm-3. Two hours after the meal, it was 6.5 mmol dm-3. Calculate the percentage change. 
Percentage change = (6.5 - 4.2) / 4.2 x 100 = 55% (2 s.f.) So the person's blood glucose concentration was 55% higher after the meal. Ratios can also be used to compare different types of quantities, such as comparing an organism's surface area to volume ratio. Ratios are most useful in their simplest form, achieved by dividing each side by the same number until no further simplification is possible.

@@@Using Logarithms to Plot Graphs and the Importance of Averages
It's tricky to plot graphs with very small and very large numbers (e.g. both 0.1 and 1000) on the same axis. We can make it easier by converting values to their logarithms and plotting them on a logarithmic scale, such as a log10 scale. On a log10 scale, each value is ten times larger than the value before. This means the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 on a log10 scale correspond to 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000 on a linear scale. To calculate logarithms, one typically uses the log button on a calculator, commonly representing log10, but it's essential to know how your calculator works. When experiments are repeated, it's standard to calculate the mean (average) by adding together all data values and dividing by the number of values in the sample. Additionally, it's often necessary to calculate the range, showing data spread, by subtracting the smallest data value from the largest. However, standard deviation can be more valuable than range, as it indicates how values cluster around the mean, showing precision. Besides the mean, the median and mode are also types of averages. The median is the middle value when data are in numerical order, or the average of the middle two values if the data count is even, while the mode is the value appearing most often, though data may have no mode or multiple modes.

@@@Considerations When Rounding Numbers and Using Standard Form
When processing data, you may round long numbers to a certain number of significant figures. The rule of thumb is to round numbers up if the next digit is five or higher and down otherwise, but the final answer's accuracy should match the least accurate measurement used in the calculation. Additionally, very large or small numbers with many zeros can be expressed in standard form by moving the decimal point left or right, with a positive or negative power of ten representing the number of decimal places moved.

@@@The Relevance of Statistical Tests in Data Analysis
Understanding statistical tests is critical to analyzing data. The Student's t-test is useful for comparing two sets of data means to determine if the difference between them is statistically significant. The Chi-squared test suits categorical data, comparing observed versus expected results, while the correlation coefficient measures the degree of data correlation. Familiarity with statistical symbols such as < (less than), > (more than), « (much less than), and » (much more than) is also important.

@@@Graph Selection and Interpretation Skills
Choosing a suitable graph type is a fundamental step for presenting data. Bar charts or pie charts are appropriate for qualitative or discrete data, while histograms or line graphs serve continuous data. With scatter graphs, relationships between two variables can be visualized. When constructing graphs, ensure the dependent variable is on the y-axis, label axes with quantity and units, and use a scale that allows the graph to cover at least half of the graph paper. Calculate rates from graphs by finding the gradient of a straight or tangent line for linear or curved data representations, respectively. Understanding how to convert units and consider significant figures are also crucial skills for accurate data interpretation."
58,"@@@Introduction to Proteins and Their Amino Acid Building Blocks

Proteins are diverse biomolecules essential for various functions within living organisms. They are complex structures composed of long chains of amino acids. As the monomers of proteins, amino acids can combine in various ways: two amino acids join to form a dipeptide, whereas a polypeptide is constituted by the linkage of more than two amino acids. Proteins themselves are then made up of one or more polypeptides. An example provided is Grant's outcry against dipeptides due to a personal grudge, adding a touch of humor to the explanation. To better understand amino acids, they are characterized by having a general structure consisting of a carboxyl group (-COOH), an amine group (-NH2), and a variable R group which distinguishes the 20 types of amino acids shared among all living organisms. Amino acids are linked by condensation reactions to form polypeptides, with peptide bonds being established between amino acids, and water molecules being released in the process. Additionally, the reverse reaction of peptide bond breaking occurs during digestion, known as hydrolysis.

@@@Understanding Protein Structure: The Four Levels

The intricate nature of proteins can be elucidated through their structural hierarchy spanning four levels. The primary structure refers to the unique sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain. In the secondary structure, hydrogen bond interactions cause the polypeptide chain to automatically coil into an alpha (α) helix or fold into a beta (β) pleated sheet. The tertiary structure involves further coiling and folding, with additional bonds, such as hydrogen and ionic bonds, contributing to the protein's three-dimensional conformation. Disulfide bridges, specifically between cysteine amino acids, further stabilize this structure. For proteins comprised of a single polypeptide chain, the tertiary structure represents their final 3D structure. However, proteins with multiple polypeptide chains exhibit a quaternary structure, which defines how these individual chains assemble to form the functional protein, as in the cases of hemoglobin and insulin. The text concludes with an analogy comparing protein structure to a Slinky toy, which can help picture the complex coiling and interaction that proteins undergo.

@@@Diverse Functions of Proteins in Living Organisms

Proteins fulfill numerous roles owing to their varied structures and shapes tailored for specific functions. Enzymes, typically spherical due to tight polypeptide folding, are soluble and play significant roles in metabolism, such as breaking down or synthesizing large molecules. Antibodies, crucial components of the immune response, consist of two light polypeptide chains and two heavy chains, featuring a variable region with diverse amino acid sequences. Transport proteins, including channel proteins integral to cell membranes, are made up of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids that cause the proteins to fold, forming channels for molecule and ion transport. Structural proteins, notably strong due to long polypeptide chains and cross-links, include keratin and collagen, present in hair, nails, and connective tissue, respectively.

@@@Identification of Proteins: The Biuret Test

Detecting the presence of proteins in a sample, such as a food sample, can be achieved via the biuret test, which involves two stages. To create an alkaline test environment, a few drops of sodium hydroxide solution are introduced, followed by the addition of copper(II) sulfate solution. A positive result, indicated by a color change to purple, confirms protein presence, whereas the solution remaining blue signifies a negative result. Due to the subtle coloration, careful observation is required during the test. This process is significant in biochemical analyses, where the confirmation of proteins is crucial.

@@@Practice and Exam Questions to Assess Understanding

In reinforcing the reader's comprehension of the presented material, practice questions prompt them to recall common groups in amino acid molecules, enumerate three functions of proteins, and describe the procedure for testing protein presence in a sample. Exam questions further challenge the understanding by asking for a description of dipeptide formation with a specific example of leucyl-alanine and an explanation of the tertiary structure in a single-polypeptide protein like myoglobin. This section serves as a direct application of the knowledge gained, providing an opportunity for self-assessment and a more tangible grasp of protein structure concepts."
59,"@@@Enzyme Action: Essential Biological Catalysts
Enzymes crop up loads in biology — they're really useful because they make reactions work quickly. So, whether you feel the need for some speed or not, read on — because you really need to know this basic stuff about enzymes. Enzymes speed up chemical reactions by acting as biological catalysts. A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being used up in the reaction itself. Enzymes catalyse metabolic reactions — both at a cellular level (e.g. respiration) and for the organism as a whole (e.g. digestion in mammals). Enzymes can affect structures in an organism (e.g. enzymes are involved in the production of collagen, an important protein in the connective tissues of animals) as well as functions (like respiration). Enzyme action can be intracellular — within cells, or extracellular — outside cells. Enzymes are proteins (see previous page). Enzymes have an active site, which has a specific shape. The active site is the part of the enzyme where the substrate molecules (the substance that the enzyme interacts with) bind to. Enzymes are highly specific due to their tertiary structure (see next page).

@@@Enzymes Lower the Activation Energy of a Reaction
In a chemical reaction, a certain amount of energy needs to be supplied to the chemicals before the reaction will start. This is called the activation energy — it's often provided as heat. Enzymes lower the amount of activation energy that's needed, often making reactions happen at a lower temperature than they could without an enzyme. This speeds up the rate of reaction. When a substrate fits into the enzyme's active site it forms an enzyme-substrate complex — it's this that lowers the activation energy. Here are two reasons why:
1) If two substrate molecules need to be joined, being attached to the enzyme holds them close together, reducing any repulsion between the molecules so they can bond more easily.
2) If the enzyme is catalysing a breakdown reaction, fitting into the active site puts a strain on bonds in the substrate, so the substrate molecule breaks up more easily. The diagram illustrates the energy profile of a chemical reaction both with and without an enzyme, demonstrating how the activation energy is reduced in the presence of an enzyme.

@@@The ‘Lock and Key’ Model and its Evolution to 'Induced Fit'
Enzymes are a bit picky — they only work with substrates that fit their active site. Early scientists studying the action of enzymes came up with the 'lock and key' model. This is where the substrate fits into the enzyme in the same way that a key fits into a lock, and the enzyme is unchanged after the reaction. Scientists soon realized that the lock and key model didn't give the full story. The enzyme and substrate do have to fit together in the first place, but new evidence showed that the enzyme-substrate complex changed shape slightly to complete the fit. This locks the substrate even more tightly to the enzyme. Scientists modified the old lock and key model and came up with the 'induced fit' model.

However, new evidence showed that the enzyme-substrate complex changes shape slightly to complete the fit, which brought about a new model known as the 'induced fit' model. This model explains that the substrate doesn't only have to be the right shape to fit the active site, it also makes the active site change shape in the right way as well. The 'induced fit' model is still widely accepted — for now, anyway.

@@@Enzyme Properties and Their Relationship to Tertiary Structure
Enzymes are very specific — they usually only catalyze one reaction, for example, maltase only breaks down maltose, sucrase only breaks down sucrose. This specificity is because only one complementary substrate will fit into the active site. The active site's shape is determined by the enzyme's tertiary structure (which is determined by the enzyme's primary structure). Each different enzyme has a different tertiary structure and so a different shaped active site. If the tertiary structure of the enzyme is altered in any way, the shape of the active site will change. This means that the substrate won't fit into the active site, an enzyme-substrate complex won't be formed, and the enzyme will no longer be able to carry out its function. The tertiary structure of an enzyme may be altered by changes in pH or temperature. The primary structure (amino acid sequence) of a protein is determined by a gene. If a mutation occurs in that gene, it could change the tertiary structure of the enzyme produced.

@@@Conceptual Analogy and Practice Questions
Furthermore, to better understand the importance of enzymes in reducing activation energy, one can liken it to an assault course where enzymes provide the necessary boost to overcome a significant obstacle, like helping someone over a tall wall. To solidify your understanding of enzymes and their functionality, here are a few practice and exam questions. Practice Questions: Q1 What is an enzyme?

61,"@@@Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity
Now you know what enzymes are and how they work, let's take a look at what makes them tick. Humans need things like money and the newest mobile phone, but enzymes are quite content with the right temperature and pH.

@@@Temperature's Influence on Enzyme Activity
Temperature has a Big Influence on Enzyme Activity. Like any chemical reaction, the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction increases when the temperature's increased. More heat means more kinetic energy, so molecules move faster. This makes the enzymes more likely to collide with the substrate molecules. The energy of these collisions also increases, which means each collision is more likely to result in a reaction. But, if the temperature gets too high, the reaction stops. 1) The rise in temperature makes the enzyme's molecules vibrate more. 2) If the temperature goes above a certain level, this vibration breaks some of the bonds that hold the enzyme in shape. 3) The active site changes shape and the enzyme and substrate no longer fit together. 4) At this point, the enzyme is denatured—it no longer functions as a catalyst. Optimum temperature – every enzyme has an optimum temperature; for most human enzymes, it's around 37°C but some enzymes, like those used in biological washing powders, can work well at 60 °C.

@@@pH's Effect on Enzyme Activity
pH Also Affects Enzyme Activity. All enzymes have an optimum pH value. Most human enzymes work best at pH 7 (neutral), but there are exceptions. Pepsin, for example, works best at acidic pH 2, which is useful because it's found in the stomach. Above and below the optimum pH, the H+ and OH- ions found in acids and alkalis can mess up the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds that hold the enzyme's tertiary structure in place. This makes the active site change shape, so the enzyme is denatured.

@@@Impact of Enzyme Concentration on Reaction Rate
Enzyme Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction. 1) The more enzyme molecules there are in a solution, the more likely a substrate molecule is to collide with one and form an enzyme-substrate complex. So increasing the concentration of the enzyme increases the rate of reaction. 2) But, if the amount of substrate is limited, there comes a point when there's more than enough enzyme molecules to deal with all the available substrate, so adding more enzyme has no further effect.

@@@Influence of Substrate Concentration on Reaction Rate
Substrate Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction Up to a Point. 1) The higher the substrate concentration, the faster the reaction—more substrate molecules mean a collision between substrate and enzyme is more likely and so more active sites will be used. This is only true up until a 'saturation' point though. After that, there are so many substrate molecules that the enzymes have about as much as they can cope with (all the active sites are full), and adding more makes no difference. 2) Substrate concentration decreases with time during a reaction (unless more substrate is added to the reaction mixture), so if no other variables are changed, the rate of reaction will decrease over time too. This makes the initial rate of reaction (the reaction rate at the start) the highest rate of reaction.

@@@Concluding Remarks on Biological Molecules - Topic 1A
This discussion provides an overview of how various factors such as temperature, pH, enzyme concentration, and substrate concentration influence enzyme activity. Understanding these factors is crucial for manipulating and predicting the behavior of enzymes in biological systems, as outlined in Topic 1A – Biological Molecules."
62,"@@@SPECIFICATION REFERENCE: THE CHEMISTRY OF LIFE 1A
Biology is the study of living things – which consist of chemicals, like the dragonfly, the plant it rests on (fig A), the cow in fig C, and the salt it licks. Understanding basic principles of chemistry aids in grasping biological systems, as the bonds within and between molecules influence their properties and functions. For instance, understanding water's chemistry requires knowledge of chemical bonds and molecule dipoles.

Basic units of elements are atoms, and compounds form when different elements' atoms react. Atom structure includes a nucleus with protons and neutrons, and surrounding electrons in shells. Chemical stability results from a full outer electron shell, achieved through ionic or covalent bonding. In ionic bonding, atoms give or receive electrons, becoming ions held together by ionic bonds (fig B). Covalent bonding involves sharing electrons, yielding usually neutral, strong molecules; some have dipoles due to uneven electron sharing (fig D).

@@@IONIC AND COVALENT BONDING
Ionic bonding describes the process where atoms involved in a reaction either give or receive electrons, forming anions (negative ions) and cations (positive ions), which are held together by strong ionic bonds, as exemplified by the formation of sodium chloride (fig B). Covalent bonding, in contrast, involves the sharing of electrons between atoms resulting in strong and often neutral molecules, although some can be polar if electrons aren't shared equally, leading to slight charge separations known as dipoles (fig D). These dipoles are common when hydrogen atoms are involved in the bond.

@@@THE IMPORTANCE OF INORGANIC IONS
Cells, comprising 60-70% water, often carry ionic substances that dissociate into ions in solution. These ions perform specific roles within cells and organisms. Nitrate ions contribute to plants' DNA, amino acids, and protein synthesis. Phosphate ions are necessary for ATP, ADP, DNA, and RNA. Chloride ions help in nerve impulses and secretory systems, while hydrogen carbonate ions regulate blood pH. Sodium ions aid in nerve impulses, calcium ions in plants' and animals' structure and muscle function, hydrogen ions in cellular processes and pH balance, and magnesium ions in chlorophyll production. Understanding the differences between ionic substances, charged particles, and polar molecules is crucial for biology students (fig C).

@@@THE CHEMISTRY OF WATER
All cellular reactions occur in water, making it vital for bodily substance transportation and as a reaction participant in photosynthesis; it's necessary for all life forms (fig E). Water, a H2O molecule, is polar because of its asymmetric electron distribution, contributing to water's unique properties, such as high melting and boiling points fostered by the many hydrogen bonds between its molecules (fig G).

@@@THE IMPORTANCE OF WATER
Water's properties make it indispensable in biological systems. Its polarity allows it to dissolve various substances, being a universal solvent and excellent transport medium. Water's unusual density behavior allows ice to float, acting as an insulator. It has a high heat capacity, essential for habitat stability. Water is incompressible, cohesive, and adhesive, playing roles in transport systems and demonstrating high surface tension. These attributes of water, derived from its dipoles and hydrogen bonding, influence various biological functions (fig H). Biology students should understand the connections between water's properties, dipoles, and hydrogen bonding, exploring both positive and negative impacts on organisms.

@@@EXAM HINTS, CHECKPOINT, AND SUBJECT VOCABULARY
To excel in biology exams, grasp the concepts of dipoles, differences between ionic and polar substances, formation of hydrogen bonds, and water's impact on life. Discussing issues in exam answers means exploring all aspects and providing balanced assessments. Biology vocabulary to remember includes anion, cation, ionic bonds, covalent bonds, dipole, polar molecule, dissociation, and hydrogen bonds, which are fundamental for problem-solving skills.

REFERENCE1 THE CHEMISTRY OF LIFE 1A consists of learning about the chemical basis of living things and the importance of water as a solvent in transport. The dipole nature of water plays a crucial role in this context. Learning Objectives include understanding the importance of water, its dipole nature, and its role in biological transport systems.

@@@IONIC AND COVALENT BONDING
Biology is inherently connected to chemistry since all living things, such as dragonflies, plants, and cows, are composed of chemicals. For instance, the chemical salt, as seen in fig C, is essential for the survival of a cow. A fundamental understanding of chemistry and its principles, particularly chemical bonds and the creation of dipoles in molecules, contributes to a deeper comprehension of biological systems. Atoms are the basic unit of elements and can form compounds by reacting with each other. Atoms consist of a nucleus with protons and neutrons, which is surrounded by electrons in shell orbitals. Chemical reactions involving these atoms aim to achieve a stable outer electron shell through processes like ionic bonding, where electrons are transferred leading to ion formation and the resulting ionic bonds, as shown in fig B with the formation of sodium chloride. On the other hand, covalent bonding involves the sharing of electrons. Some covalent compounds are polarized, with slightly negative and positive parts due to uneven sharing of electrons. Polar molecules such as the water molecule (fig D) exhibit this dipole characteristic, which is common in bonds involving hydrogen atoms.

@@@THE IMPORTANCE OF INORGANIC IONS
The dissolution of ionic substances in water leads to dissociation, allowing the ions to separate. Since cells in living organisms are composed of a significant amount of water, ionic substances generally exist as ions within these cells, fulfilling various specialized roles. Inorganic ions have specific functions in both individual cells and organisms. For example, nitrate ions are important for DNA and protein synthesis in plants, phosphate ions are needed for ATP, ADP, DNA, RNA, and chloride ions play a role in nerve impulses and other systems, while hydrogen carbonate ions buffer blood pH. Concerning cations, sodium ions are significant in nerve function, calcium ions are essential for plant cell structure and animal bone formation, hydrogen ions are involved in metabolism and pH balance, and magnesium ions are vital for chlorophyll production in plants. Understanding and differentiating between ionic substances, charged particles, and polar molecules is vital for exam preparedness. Animals, such as cows illustrated in fig C, obtain necessary salts for bodily functions through mineral licks.

64,"@@@INTRODUCTION TO MAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF BLOOD CLOTTING
You have a limited volume of blood. In theory, a minor cut could endanger life as the torn blood vessels allow blood to escape. First, your blood volume will reduce and if you lose too much blood, you will die. Second, pathogens can get into your body through an open wound. In normal circumstances, your body protects you through the clotting mechanism of the blood. This mechanism seals damaged blood vessels to minimise blood loss and prevent pathogens getting in.

@@@INITIAL PHASES OF FORMING A CLOT
Plasma, blood cells, and platelets flow from a cut vessel. Contact between the platelets and components of the tissue (e.g., collagen fibers in the skin) causes the platelets to break open in large numbers. They release several substances, two of which are particularly important. Serotonin causes the smooth muscle of the blood vessel to contract. This narrows the blood vessels, cutting off the blood flow to the damaged area. Thromboplastin is an enzyme that starts a sequence of chemical changes that clot the blood (see fig H). The cascade of events that results in a life-saving or life-threatening clot. When you cut yourself, this is the process which seals the blood vessels and protects the delicate new tissues that form underneath.

@@@DETAILS OF THE BLOOD CLOTTING PROCESS
The blood clotting process is a very complex sequence of events in which there are many different clotting factors. Vitamin K is important in the production of many of the compounds needed for the blood to clot, including prothrombin. Here is a simple version of the events in the blood clotting process.

Thromboplastin catalyses the conversion of a large soluble protein called prothrombin found in the plasma into another soluble protein, the enzyme called thrombin. Prothrombin is biologically inactive while thrombin is biologically active – prothrombin is a precursor of thrombin. This conversion happens on a large scale at the site of a wound. Calcium ions need to be present in the blood at the right concentration for this reaction to happen.

Thrombin acts on another soluble plasma protein called fibrinogen, converting it to an insoluble substance called fibrin. Again, fibrinogen is the biologically inactive precursor of biologically active fibrin. The fibrin forms a mesh of fibers to cover the wound.

65,"@@@Understanding DNA Replication: An Introduction
DNA has the amazing ability to replicate (copy) itself. These pages cover the facts behind the replication mechanism, as well as some of the history behind its discovery. This stuff is really clever. Honest.

@@@The Semi-Conservative Nature of DNA Replication
DNA replicates by semi-conservative replication. DNA copies itself before cell division (see p. 32) so that each new cell has the full amount of DNA. The method is called semi-conservative replication because half of the strands in each new DNA molecule are from the original DNA molecule. This means that there's genetic continuity between generations of cells (i.e., the cells produced by cell division inherit their genes from their parent cells). The process involves several steps:
1) The enzyme DNA helicase breaks the hydrogen bonds between bases on the two polynucleotide DNA strands, making the helix unwind to form two single strands.
2) Each original single strand acts as a template for a new strand. Complementary base pairing means that free-floating DNA nucleotides are attracted to their complementary exposed bases on each original template strand — A with T and C with G.
3) Condensation reactions join the nucleotides of the new strands together — catalyzed by the enzyme DNA polymerase. Hydrogen bonds form between the bases on the original and new strands.
4) Each new DNA molecule contains one strand from the original DNA molecule and one new strand.

@@@Directionality in DNA Replication: DNA Polymerase Function
DNA polymerase moves in opposite ways along the antiparallel DNA strands. Each end of a DNA strand is slightly different in its structure. One end is called the 3' (three prime) end and the other is called the 5' (five prime) end. In a DNA helix, the strands run in opposite directions — they're antiparallel. The active site of DNA polymerase is only complementary to the 3' end of the newly forming DNA strand, meaning the enzyme can only add nucleotides to the new strand at the 3' end. As a consequence, the new strand is made in a 5' to 3' direction and the DNA polymerase moves down the template strand in a 3' to 5' direction. Because the strands are antiparallel, the two DNA polymerases working on each strand move in opposite directions.

@@@Historical Experiment: Evidence for Semi-Conservative Replication
Meselson and Stahl provided crucial evidence for semi-conservative replication. Initially, Watson and Crick, who determined the structure of DNA, proposed the theory of semi-conservative replication. This was later confirmed by Meselson and Stahl's experiment. Before their work, it was uncertain whether DNA replication was semi-conservative or conservative. They used isotopes of nitrogen to track the replication process:
1) Two samples of bacteria were grown in nutrient broths, one containing light nitrogen (14N) and the other containing heavy nitrogen (15N).
2) DNA samples from each batch were centrifuged, with heavy nitrogen DNA settling lower because of its weight.
3) Bacteria from the heavy nitrogen batch were transferred to a broth with only light nitrogen and allowed to replicate.
4) If replication was conservative, heavy (original) DNA would settle at the bottom, new light DNA at the top.
5) If replication was semi-conservative, new bacterial DNA molecules would contain strands of both old heavy DNA and new light DNA, hence settling in the middle.
6) The DNA settled in the middle, indicating a mixture of heavy and light nitrogen, thus confirming semi-conservative replication in bacteria. After this discovery, other scientists demonstrated that this method is universal for DNA replication in living organisms.

66,"@@@SPECIFICATION REFERENCE AND LEARNING OBJECTIVES
1BSPECIFICATION REFERENCE1.73 CIRCULATION IN THE BLOOD VESSELS. Learning objectives include understanding how the structures of blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries) relate to their functions.

@@@OVERVIEW OF BLOOD VESSELS AND THEIR FUNCTION
The blood vessels that make up the circulatory system can be thought of as the biological equivalent of a road transport system. The arteries and veins are like large roads carrying heavy traffic while the narrow town streets and tracks are represented by the vast area of branching and spreading capillaries called the capillary network. In the capillary network, substances carried by the blood are exchanged with cells in the same way that products are transported from factories, oil refineries, or farms and distributed into shops and homes. The structures of the different types of blood vessels closely reflect their functions in your body.

@@@ARTERIES AND THEIR STRUCTURE
Arteries carry blood away from your heart towards the cells of your body. Almost all arteries carry oxygenated blood, with the pulmonary artery and the umbilical artery during pregnancy as exceptions. The arteries leaving the heart branch off in every direction, and the diameter of the lumen gets smaller the further away it is from the heart, ending with the arterioles. The middle layers of the artery wall contain elastic fibers and smooth muscle; arteries nearest to the heart have more elastic fibers, while those further from the heart have a greater proportion of muscle tissue. Blood is pumped out from the heart in a regular rhythm, about 70 times a minute, with each heartbeat sending a high-pressure flow of blood into the arteries. The major arteries close to the heart must withstand these pressure surges and contain a lot of elastic fibers so that they can stretch and accommodate the greater volume of blood without being damaged. Between surges, the elastic fibers return to their original length, squeezing the blood to move it along in a continuous flow. The pulse felt in an artery is the effect of the surge each time the heart beats. The blood pressure in all arteries is relatively high, but it falls in arteries further away from the heart, known as the peripheral arteries. In the peripheral arteries, the muscle fibers in the vessel walls contract or relax to change the size of the lumen, controlling the blood flow. This regulates the activity of organs and will be discussed more in Book 2, Topic 7.

@@@CAPILLARIES AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE IN EXCHANGE
Arterioles lead into networks of capillaries which are very small vessels that spread throughout the tissues of the body. The capillary network links the arterioles and the venules, ensuring no cell is far from a capillary, making the diffusion between cells and blood quick. Capillaries have a very simple structure, with walls that consist of just one very thin cell, which allows rapid diffusion of substances between the blood and the cells. Oxygen and other molecules quickly diffuse out of the blood in the capillaries into nearby body cells, and carbon dioxide and waste molecules diffuse into the capillaries. The blood is oxygenated when entering the capillary network and carries less oxygen when it leaves, now with more carbon dioxide.

@@@VEINS AND THEIR ROLE IN RETURNS TO THE HEART
Veins carry blood back towards the heart, and most carry deoxygenated blood, with the pulmonary vein and the umbilical vein during pregnancy as exceptions. Tiny venules lead from the capillary network and combine into larger vessels leading back to the heart. Only two veins, the inferior vena cava and the superior vena cava, carry blood from the body tissues back to the heart. Veins can hold a large volume of blood, acting as a blood reservoir, and the low pressure in veins is due to the elimination of pressure surges before the blood reaches the capillary system. Blood returns to the heart by means of muscle pressure and one-way valves. The contraction of large muscles, particularly in the arms and legs, during physical activity squeezes the veins with the help of one-way semilunar valves, pushing blood towards the heart and preventing any backflow. This ensures that blood flows in one direction only. The characteristics of the main types of blood vessels – arteries, veins, and capillaries – are different and affect how the blood flows through the body and the role of the vessels within the body."
67,"@@@THE MAMMALIAN HEART: SPECIFICATIONS AND LEARNING OBJECTIVES
The section outlines the specifications referenced as 1.8 and 4 related to the study of the mammalian heart, focusing on the relation of its structure and operation to its function, and an understanding of the cardiac cycle. It emphasizes the heart's role within animal transport systems, particularly in mammals, where it is a four-chambered muscular organ, protected within the chest by ribs and sternum. Over an average lifetime, it beats roughly 3 billion times, pumping over 200 million liters of blood.

@@@THE STRUCTURE OF THE HEART AND ITS COMPONENTS
The mammalian heart is described as two joint pumps that work in synchronicity, with the right side receiving blood from the body to send to the lungs, and the left side doing the opposite. This process ensures that oxygenated and deoxygenated blood do not mix within the heart, thanks to a thick muscular septum and cardiac muscle that can contract regularly without fatigue. The muscle has an ample blood supply provided by the coronary arteries, and it contains myoglobin, a respiratory pigment with a high affinity for oxygen, to meet the metabolic demands of consistent contractions.

@@@ACTION OF THE HEART AND ITS FUNCTIONAL CYCLE
This section provides a deep dive into the heart's operational cycle, detailing how blood flows through the heart and the different pressures involved in the opening and closing of valves. It describes the function of heart chambers and valves like the tricuspid and bicuspid valves, the pressure changes that drive their operation, and the role of tendinous cords. The muscular distinction between the left and right sides of the heart is highlighted, explaining the varying pressure needs based on the proximity of the lungs and extremities of the body. The concept of systole and diastole as parts of the cardiac cycle is explained, noting this as a continuous process of contraction and relaxation.

@@@INTERESTING FACTS AND THE HEART'S INTERNAL COMPLEXITY
Two ""Did You Know?"" segments add interesting facts about the heart's development and its anatomy. A description of the septum and the mention of the foramen ovale provide insight into the heart's function in an embryo and the potential condition known as patent foramen ovale. It also points out that while diagrams of the mammalian heart look simple, an actual dissection reveals much more complexity, which aids in understanding how the heart functions as a three-dimensional pump.

@@@VOCABULARY AND LEARNING RESOURCES
The section concludes with a checkpoint intended to test comprehension through descriptions and discussions related to the path of blood, the relationship between structure and function in the heart, and key elements thereof. A comprehensive list of subject vocabulary defines important terms associated with the heart, its function, and the cardiac cycle, providing a learning resource for further study and understanding of this crucial organ."
68,"@@@OVERVIEW OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES
1BSPECIFICATION REFERENCE5. Learning objectives include understanding the course of events that lead to atherosclerosis. Cardiovascular diseases have serious global consequences, with almost 18 million people dying each year, according to World Health Organization data from 2017. Cardiovascular diseases accounted for 31% of all global deaths, making it the leading cause of death and disability. Notably, a third of these deaths occurred in individuals younger than 70, which underlines the severity of cardiovascular diseases and their link to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis, the hardening of the arteries, is a condition that can start in late childhood, involving the buildup of fatty plaques inside arteries, which can restrict or block blood flow. This process is particularly likely to affect the coronary and carotid arteries, with fig B summarizing the typical development of a plaque that starts with slight damage to the endothelium, followed by an inflammatory response, cholesterol build-up, atheroma formation, and then the accumulation of fibrous tissue and calcium salts. This sequence results in hardened plaques that narrow the arteries and increase rigidity. Learning tips highlight the initial damage to the endothelium often being caused by high blood pressure from smoking, and exam hints encourage memorization of the stages of atherosclerosis development.

@@@DETAILED DEVELOPMENT OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS
Atherosclerosis begins with damage to the endothelial lining of blood vessels, potentially caused by high blood pressure or substances in tobacco smoke. This condition predominantly occurs in arteries due to the high pressure of blood flow, leading to damage in the endothelium and small areas of damage. In contrast, veins have lower pressure and are less likely to sustain such damage. Cardiovascular diseases were responsible for 31% of deaths, at times due to communicable diseases, childbirth, nutritional conditions, injuries, or other causes. Exam hints stress understanding the terms around atherosclerosis and consequential disorders like aneurysms, angina, and myocardial infarctions. 

@@@CONSEQUENCES OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS ON HEALTH
Atherosclerosis can have severe effects on health, including the formation of aneurysms, raised blood pressure, heart diseases, and strokes. An aneurysm results from the narrowing of an artery by a plaque, causing the artery to bulge and weaken with the potential for catastrophic internal bleeding. Raised blood pressure due to narrow arteries can damage essential organs such as the kidneys, eyes, and brain, possibly leading to kidney damage, blindness, or types of strokes. Heart diseases linked to atherosclerosis include angina and myocardial infarction (heart attack), with angina showing symptoms during exercise due to reduced oxygen supply, and myocardial infarction occurring when an artery is completely blocked by a clot. Diagnostic imaging using dyes, clot-busting drugs, and surgical interventions like stents and bypass surgery are discussed as treatment options. Strokes, another consequence of atherosclerosis, can lead to permanent disabilities or death, depending on the location and severity of the arterial blockage in the brain. Rapid treatment is essential for the survival and recovery process of heart attack and stroke victims. Checkpoint questions ask readers to explain the worsening nature of endothelium plaques and their dangerous implications, describe the role of atherosclerosis in cardiovascular diseases, and compare heart attacks and strokes. A skills innovation section suggests demonstrating high blood pressure through modeling aimed at educating young audiences. Finally, a vocabulary section defines relevant terms specific to the topic.

69,"@@@SPECIFICATION REFERENCE: Atherosclerosis Overview
This text outlines the learning objectives, with a focus on understanding the cascade of events that lead to atherosclerosis. It further details the impact of cardiovascular diseases, which represent a significant cause of global mortality according to World Health Organization data from 2017. The burden of cardiovascular diseases accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide, affecting a considerable number of individuals under the age of 70. Atherosclerosis is highlighted as a key contributor to many cardiovascular conditions.

@@@The Pathophysiology of Atherosclerosis
Atherosclerosis is characterized by the development of plaques within the arterial walls, starting in late childhood and progressing throughout an individual's life. These plaques can restrict or block blood flow, commonly forming in the coronary and carotid arteries. The text provides a detailed description of plaque development, from endothelial damage to inflammatory response, accumulation of cholesterol, fatty deposits, fibrous tissue, calcium salts, and eventual plaque formation that narrows arteries and stiffens their walls. The learning material encourages readers to remember that endothelial damage, often caused by factors such as high blood pressure and smoking, is the initial stage in atherosclerosis development. Furthermore, the reader is prompted to learn the stages of atherosclerosis for examination purposes.

@@@Mechanisms and Consequences of Plaque Formation
The formation of plaques within the arteries is explored in greater detail, emphasizing the role of inflammation, white blood cells, cholesterol accumulation, and the hardening of plaques. These processes contribute to the narrowing and decreased elasticity of arterial walls, compounded by rising blood pressure and possible formation of additional plaques. The text explains the cyclical nature of atherosclerosis' exacerbation and the various factors involved in its development, setting the stage for an in-depth examination in a subsequent chapter.

@@@Health Implications of Atherosclerosis
Serious health repercussions associated with atherosclerosis are unveiled. The condition can precipitate aneurysms due to arterial narrowing and ensuing blood collection, where increased pressure can lead to a weakened wall and potential rupture, causing life-threatening internal bleeding. Atherosclerosis also contributes to raised blood pressure, which inflicts damage on organs such as the kidneys, eyes, and brain. Kidney damage, retinal cell death leading to blindness, and strokes caused by cerebral bleeding are highlighted as some of the significant risks.

@@@Heart Diseases Resulting from Atherosclerosis
The text emphasizes angina and myocardial infarction as the two most common forms of heart disease associated with atherosclerosis. Angina is described as occurring due to gradual plaque accumulation in coronary arteries, which diminishes blood flow and induces pain, particularly during exercise. Treatment options for angina include lifestyle changes, medication to dilate blood vessels, and other drugs to manage heart rate. The consequences of further coronary blockage and the critical nature of understanding these medical terms for exam preparation are underscored. The section concludes with a reminder that atherosclerosis may lead to further complications such as aneurysms, angina, and myocardial infarctions, reinforcing the importance of clarity regarding these terms."
70,"@@@SPECIFICATION REFERENCE: RISK, CORRELATION AND CAUSE
REFERENCE1 RISK, CORRELATION AND CAUSE1.17 1.15 LEARNING OBJECTIVES: 
- Understand why people’s perception of risks is often different from the actual risks, including underestimating and overestimating the risks due to diet and other lifestyle factors in the development of heart disease.
- Be able to distinguish between correlation and causation. 
Every country has diseases which affect its people and may even kill them. Some of these diseases affect you randomly – there is nothing you can do to change whether you are affected or not. However, for many diseases, especially non-communicable (non-infectious) conditions such as heart disease and cancer, you can increase or lower your risk of becoming ill, based on factors in your lifestyle. If you understand the risk factors, you can help to make yourself and your family healthier.

@@@UNDERSTANDING RISK AND PROBABILITY
WHAT IS RISK? 
The word risk is used regularly in everyday conversation, but in science, it has a very specific meaning. In science, risk describes the probability that an event will happen. Probability means the chance or likelihood of the event, calculated mathematically. For example, imagine you have six coloured balls – red, blue, green, yellow, orange, and purple – in a black cloth bag (see fig A). If you reach in and pull out a single ball, the probability (risk) of getting, say, a green ball can be expressed in one of three ways:
- 1 in 6
- 0.166 recurring (0.17)
- 17%.
This is the case for any one of the six colours in the bag. In the same way, it is possible to work out your risk of developing certain specified diseases or of dying from a specified cause.

@@@PERCEPTION VS. MATHEMATICAL RISK
HOW DO WE PERCEIVE RISK? 
The actual risk of doing something is not always the same as the sense of risk one feels. Most people don’t think twice before getting into their car – but globally you have an annual risk of 1 in 5747 of being killed in a road traffic accident. On the other hand, many people get very worried before flying, but commercial flights have a 1 in 4.5–5.5 million risk of crashing. Personal perception of risk is based on a variety of factors which include:
- How familiar you are with the activity 
- How much you enjoy the activity 
- Whether or not you approve of the activity.
The actual mathematical risk may play very little part in developing your personal perception of risk. People often overestimate the benefits, or minimize the risk, of behavior that they want to continue. Conversely, they will over-emphasize the risks of activities they want to avoid or prevent others from doing them. While there is strong evidence that obesity is linked to diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers, people still become overweight due to their liking for eating. Similarly, the knowledge of the mathematical risk of an early death if you smoke cigarettes doesn’t always stop people from smoking.

@@@CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH AND RISK: THE ROLE OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
EPIDEMIOLOGY: 
If you know the number of people in a population who are affected by a disease, it is possible to calculate the average risk of developing that disease for a person within that population. However, the risk is higher for some than others, based on lifestyle and inherited genes. Identifying risk factors that may contribute to the cause of a disease is possible by comparing the risks of people with common factors (e.g., smoking) against the average risk for the whole population. In the case of diseases influenced by many factors, such as atherosclerosis, the condition is called multifactorial. The study of disease patterns and causes is known as epidemiology. It's important to note that correlation, when two datasets change together, does not equate to causation; further research is needed to establish a causal link.

@@@ANALYZING DATA AND EXAM HINTS
EXAM HINT: When provided with data in the form of a graph, make sure to read the axis titles carefully to understand what the data represents. Also, do not base conclusions on a single set of data. For instance, UAE data suggests obesity is linked to diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, consistent with global findings. Dr. Raghib Ali's ongoing Healthy Future Study in Abu Dhabi aims to confirm these patterns and find ways to reduce disease risks. When analyzing stats, such as the UAE obesity and diabetes figures in relation to cardiovascular disease deaths, it is essential to gather more data to substantiate any causal relationships.

@@@PERSONAL AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN CONTEXT OF RISK
CHECKPOINT: 
Questions are posed to reinforce understanding, such as explaining the difference between risk, correlation, and causation, and the implications of smoking on heart disease risk, suggesting reasons for the prevalence of obesity despite the known risks, and instructing to create a bar chart based on given statistics to compare with the UAE data.

SPECIFICATION REFERENCE1C2 INVESTIGATING THE CAUSES OF CVDs1.16 1.12
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
◼ Be able to evaluate the design of studies used to determine health risk factors, including sample selection and 
sample size used to collect data that are both valid and reliable.
◼ Know how factors such as genetics, age and gender increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).
Everywhere you look, on television, in newspapers and on the 
internet, there are reports of factors which affect your health. Eat fruit and vegetables, drink orange juice, take lots of exercise, enjoy these foods – how do we know which advice is based on good science, and which is given to us because someone wants to sell us something? There are many ways in which you can evaluate the design of studies to decide if the data are meaningful.

@@@DESIGNING STUDIES TO INVESTIGATE HEALTH RISKS
DESIGNING STUDIES
Most epidemiological studies are based on a very big sample size – usually, the bigger the study, the more meaningful the results. The ideal is to investigate one factor or variable, keeping all other variables the same (controlled). However, controlling variables is almost impossible when you are working with human beings. The way people live is complex and varies a lot, so it is hard to detect how any one factor affects people. When a larger number of people are studied, it is more likely that patterns may emerge, even with all the other differences between the people involved. Evidence based on large amounts of data is more likely to be statistically significant than evidence based on small studies.

@@@SIGNIFICANCE OF LONGITUDINAL STUDIES AND META-ANALYSIS
Some epidemiological studies are carried out over a long time. These longitudinal studies are very valuable because they follow the same group of individuals over many years (see fig A). This means the impact of their known lifestyle on their health can be tracked over time. For example, the Münster Heart Study looked at cardiovascular disease in 10,856 men aged 36–65 in Europe, following them from the start of the study well into the 21st century. The results from this study are still seen as important because so many people were involved over a long period of time. The Framingham Study in the US also provided much data – but was limited because they were all from similar American citizens. The study started in 1948 and it is still going on – the scientists have widened the population they gather data from, so it is more relevant now. An ambitious new study called the National Children’s Study has been set up in the US to follow 100,000 children from birth until they are 21 years old. From 2008–2012, children were selected to be representative of the whole of the US population. One major objective of the study is to examine how environmental inputs and genetic factors interact to affect the health and development of children. This is believed to be the biggest longitudinal study ever set up. Similarly, the UAE Healthy Future Study will be longitudinal, looking at the same group of volunteers over a number of years.

Sometimes, scientists look at all the available studies in a subject area and analyse the available data in a massive literature study. This combines small and large studies and can give more reliable evidence than any one of the studies alone. This is called a metadata analysis (meta-analysis).

@@@EVALUATING SCIENTIFIC STUDIES FOR VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY
EVALUATING SCIENTIFIC STUDIES
When considering a study, you need to examine the methodology to see if it is valid. That means that it is properly designed to answer the question or questions being asked. You also need to see if the measurements have been carried out with precision. It is important to find out if other scientists have been able to repeat the methodology and have had similar results – if so, the results are considered more reliable.
It is also important to know who carried out the research, who funded it and where it was published. Then to decide whether or not any of these factors might have affected or biased the study. You need to evaluate the data and conclusions from the study in the light of all these factors.

@@@EXAM HINT AND REVIEW OF RISK FACTORS
EXAM HINT
Remember the meaning of the following terms.
Valid: answers the question the scientists are asking
Precise: measurements with little difference between them
Reliable: the investigation is repeatable by other scientists who get 
similar results
They are important in evaluating all practical work and research.

In the next few pages, you are going to look at some of the evidence that scientists have collected suggesting factors that may – or may not – affect your risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In each case, you need to look carefully at the type of evidence that is presented and think about what else you need to know to make firm conclusions.

@@@NON-MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS FOR CVDs AND HOW STUDIES INFORM UNDERSTANDING
RISK FACTORS FOR CVDs
The results from many epidemiological studies have identified a range of risk factors linked to CVDs. These factors divide into two main groups – those you can’t change and those you can do something about (see Section 1C.3).
NON-MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS FOR ATHEROSCLEROSIS
There are three main risk factors for CVDs which cannot (at the present time) be changed.
 • Genes: studies show that there is a genetic tendency (trend) in some families, and also in some ethnic groups, to develop CVDs. These trends can include–
arteries which are easily damaged
– a tendency to develop hypertension which can cause arterial damage and make CVDs more likely
– problems with the cholesterol balance of the body.
 • Age: as you get older, your blood vessels begin to lose their elasticity and to narrow slightly. This can make you more likely to suffer from CVDs, particularly heart disease.
 • Gender: statistically, under the age of 50, men are more likely to suffer from heart disease (and other CVDs) than women. The female hormone oestrogen, which is an important factor in the woman’s menstrual cycle, appears to reduce the build-up of plaque. This gives women some protection against CVDs until they go through the menopause when oestrogen levels fall.

@@@EVIDENCE FROM GENETIC STUDIES IN SWEDEN
LOOKING AT THE DATA
Identical twin studies are an excellent resource when investigating whether there is a genetic factor at work, because identical twins have exactly the same genes. Any differences should therefore be due to the environment in which they live. A major twin study was conducted in Sweden and was based on over 21,000 pairs of twins, both identical and non-identical. This study showed that (for male twins) if one twin died of heart disease between the ages of 36 and 55, then the risk of the other twin also dying of heart disease was eight times higher than if neither was affected (see fig A). However, as the twins got older, one dying of heart disease had less of a correlation with the other twin also dying of heart disease. In other words, there appears to be a clear genetic link to heart disease in younger men, but it gets less in much older men.

72,"@@@SPECIFICATION REFERENCE AND LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Reference1C3 outlines the risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The learning objectives include evaluating the design of studies used to determine health risk factors, which entails understanding sample selection and ensuring data collection methods produce valid and reliable data. Additionally, learners are expected to know how factors like diet, high blood pressure, smoking, and inactivity increase the risk of CVD. An important note is that while non-modifiable factors such as age, genetics, and gender remain constant worldwide, the variation in CVD-related mortality rates across countries implies additional influences like lifestyle factors. Understanding how our lifestyle choices influence our likelihood of developing or dying from heart disease is a critical component of this topic, depicted by the data in Figure A which illustrates the deaths from CVDs in different countries based on 2012 data.

@@@EXAM HINT AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS
In preparation for exams, students are advised to analyze provided graphs for trends and comparison points before delving into related questions. This helps in understanding the question's requirements. Modifiable risk factors related to lifestyle are significant in preventing CVDs. These include factors such as exercise frequency, diet, and smoking status. By making conscious lifestyle changes, like quitting smoking and engaging in regular physical activity, individuals can mitigate their risk of developing CVDs and the related condition of atherosclerosis. Epidemiological studies have found robust links between lifestyle choices and the subsequent risk of atherosclerosis, evidenced by studies featuring Harvard University male graduates and female nurses, which show that increased physical activity correlates with lowered mortality and reduced incidences of atherosclerosis and CVDs.

@@@SPECIFIC LIFESTYLE RISK FACTORS AND THEIR IMPACT ON ATHEROSCLEROSIS AND CVDs
Certain lifestyle factors have been identified as directly contributing to the risk of developing atherosclerosis and CVDs. Studies have shown that smokers are at an exorbitantly higher risk of forming atherosclerosis than non-smokers. Similarly, inactivity is directly linked to poor cardiovascular outcomes, as exercise has been proven to both reduce plaque formation and stabilize existing plaques in arteries. High blood pressure is another key player, as it can be indicative of vascular health and is associated with a higher risk of atherosclerosis. On the dietary front, while obesity has been shown to be a less direct indicator of CVD risk, the location of body fat, levels of exercise, and specific blood fat levels have been identified as significant predictors of future CVD incidences. A direct outcome of being overweight, like high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, greatly heightens the risk of CVDs.

@@@CONNECTIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT RISK FACTORS AND PREVENTING CVDs
The intersection of various lifestyle factors elevates the risk of developing CVDs. Smoking, for instance, affects the risk through its impact on blood vessels and blood pressure while also disturbing the equilibrium of lipoproteins in the blood. The prevention of atherosclerosis and CVDs revolves around lifestyle changes substantiated by ongoing scientific research, which points towards maintaining a balanced diet, regular exercise, appropriate stress management, and abstaining from smoking. Recognizing and countering risk factors early is crucial, especially given evidence of atherosclerotic indicators in younger demographics.

@@@CHECKPOINT QUESTIONS, SKILLS, AND VOCABULARY
To synthesize the understanding of the topic, checkpoint questions are provided, prompting students to distinguish between modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, identify specific risk factors and their impact on atherosclerosis and CVDs, and analyze data to comprehend the global distribution and implications of CVDs.

Diffusion, the free movement of particles in a liquid or gas down a concentration gradient, is one of the main ways substances move into and out of cells. Single-celled organisms and microscopic multicellular organisms rely on diffusion to meet all their needs, however, larger organisms require more than diffusion alone. Small organisms like amoebas and many marine larvae are able to get nutrients and oxygen through direct diffusion due to short diffusion distances, large surface area to volume ratios, and low metabolic demands. The surface area to volume ratio is crucial in determining whether diffusion is an adequate means of substance movement within an organism, which is demonstrated using models such as simple cubes and spheres to show changes in this ratio as organism size increases.

@@@MODELLING SURFACE AREA: VOLUME RATIOS

The surface area to volume ratio is key to understanding whether diffusion will be efficient enough for an organism. The difficulty in calculating this ratio for complex or irregularly shaped organisms like Amoeba, elephants, or people results in scientists using models like cubes or spheres to represent organisms and make calculations easier. As the organism gets larger, the surface area to volume ratio decreases, making diffusion less effective for meeting the needs of the cells. Illustrated examples of different size cubes and their corresponding surface area to volume ratios are provided to clarify this concept.

@@@THE NEED FOR TRANSPORT IN MULTICELLULAR ANIMALS

Large multicellular organisms have cells with high demands for chemical substances like glucose and oxygen for cellular respiration and must remove waste products like carbon dioxide efficiently. Internal transport systems exist to carry substances to every cell, delivering oxygen and nutrients and removing waste. The heart and circulatory system act as a mass transport system in many animals, moving substances to individual cells through diffusion, osmosis, and active transport. The effectiveness of mass transport systems highlights common features including exchange surfaces, a system of vessels, directionality, efficient movement, suitable transport mediums, and adaptability to the organism's needs.

@@@CIRCULATION SYSTEMS AND THE ADVANTAGES OF CLOSED SYSTEMS

Animals have various types of circulatory systems—a closed system in larger animals, like mammals, and an open system in insects. A closed circulatory system ensures blood is contained within tubes and can be pumped around the body under pressure. The advantages of a closed system include increased blood flow speed and directionality towards organs that require the most oxygen and nutrients. Single circulation systems like in fish are simpler, with the heart pumping deoxygenated blood to the gills and then around the body before returning to the heart.

@@@DOUBLE CIRCULATION IN BIRDS AND MAMMALS

Birds and mammals, due to their high oxygen and nutrient requirements, have evolved a more complex transport system known as double circulation, involving separate systemic and pulmonary circuits. The systemic circulation carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the body cells and returns deoxygenated blood to the heart, while the pulmonary circulation transfers deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs to receive oxygen and then back to the heart. The efficiency of the double circulatory system is emphasized, explaining its ability to quickly deliver oxygenated blood at high pressure to the body's tissues, while low-pressure blood movement in the lungs allows for effective gas exchange.

@@@MASS TRANSPORT SYSTEMS IN EXAMS AND CHECKPOINT QUESTIONS

The ability of mass transport systems to overcome the limitations of diffusion in organisms with a small surface area to volume ratio is highlighted, and readers are prompted to remember to clearly express this in exam settings. A checkpoint list poses reflective questions to reinforce comprehension of the material covered, such as explaining why large animals cannot rely solely on diffusion through their skin and detailing the characteristics of mass transport systems.

@@@GLOSSARY OF TERMS AND SKILLS FOR ADAPTIVE LEARNING

This subsection provides a glossary defining key terms related to the topic, such as diffusion, concentration gradient, surface area to volume ratio, vertebrates, mass transport system, single and double circulation systems, systemic and pulmonary circulation, oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. It emphasizes the terminology and concepts necessary for a deeper understanding of the principles of circulation, while touching on the adaptive learning skills needed to navigate the content effectively."
74,"@@@Examples of Creating Added Value in Businesses
Here are two examples of how different businesses could create added value to their products:
1. Jewellers – well-designed shop-window display, attractive shop fittings, well-dressed and knowledgeable shop assistants and beautiful boxes offered to customers to put new jewellery in. These features might allow an increase in jewellery prices above the additional costs involved.
2. Sweet manufacturer – extensive advertising of the brand of sweets to create an easily recognised name and brand identity, attractive packaging, selling through established confectionery shops and not ‘cheap’ vending machines. Higher prices as a result of successful branding should create added value.

Creating value requires effective management of resources. The most successful businesses in terms of creating value tend to be customer-focused. Many customers are prepared to pay relatively high prices for products which exactly meet their needs – creating more value for the business.

@@@Understanding Economic Activity and the Problem of Choice
KEY CONCEPT LINK
Economic activity and the problem of choice
We live in a world of great wealth and great scarcity. Very poor people are unable to obtain the basic requirements of life – food, clean water, shelter – and they have many unsatisfied needs and wants. Even very rich people may not be able to satisfy all of their wants for luxury goods and services. It should be clear to us all that there are insufficient goods to satisfy all of our needs and wants at any one time; this is known as ‘the economic problem’. It is the purpose of economic activity to provide for as many of our wants as possible, yet we are still left wanting more. This shortage of products – together with the resources needed to make them – lead to us all having to make choices. As we cannot satisfy all of our wants, then we must choose those which we will satisfy now and those which we will forgo. If we are careful and rational, we will choose those things that give us the greatest benefit, leaving out those things of less value to us. This need to choose is not exclusive to people as consumers. All economic units have to make choices – governments, businesses, workers, charities and so on.

@@@Opportunity Cost and Economic Decision Making
Opportunity cost
This need to choose leads to the next important principle of our subject – opportunity cost. In deciding to purchase or obtain one item, we must give up other goods as they cannot all be purchased. The next most desired product given up becomes the ‘lost opportunity’ or opportunity cost. This concept exists for all economic decision makers: consumers, businesses and government.
Opportunity cost: the benefit of the next most desired option which is given up.

@@@Entrepreneurship: Risks, Rewards, and Characteristics
The role of the entrepreneur
New business ventures started by entrepreneurs can be based on a totally new idea or a new way of offering a service. They can also be a new location for an existing business idea or an attempt to adapt a good or service in ways that no one else has tried before. In this chapter, we will be looking at several examples of people who have set up their own new business and have shown skills of ‘entrepreneurship’. They have:
■ had an idea for a new business
■ invested some of their own savings and capital
■ accepted the responsibility of managing the business
■ accepted the possible risks of failure.
Entrepreneur: someone who takes the financial risk of starting and managing a new venture.

@@@Essential Qualities for Entrepreneurial Success
Characteristics of successful entrepreneurs
The personal qualities and skills needed to make a success of a new business venture include:
Innovation: The entrepreneur may not be an inventor in the traditional sense, but they must be able to carve a new niche in the market, attract customers in innovative ways and present their business as being different from others in the same market. This requires original ideas and an ability to do things differently – this is the skill of innovation.
Commitment and self-motivation: It is never an easy option to set up and run your own business. It is hard work and may take up many hours of each day. A willingness to work hard, keen ambition to succeed, energy and focus are all essential qualities of a successful entrepreneur.
Multiskilled: An entrepreneur will have to make the product (or provide the service), promote it, sell it and keep accounts. These different business tasks require a person who has many different qualities, such as being keen to learn technical skills, being able to get on with people and being good at handling money and keeping accounting records.
Leadership skills: The entrepreneur will have to lead by example and must have a personality that encourages people in the business to follow them and be motivated by them.
Self-confidence and an ability to bounce back: Many business start-ups fail, yet this would not discourage a true entrepreneur who would have such belief in themselves and their business idea that they would bounce back from any setbacks.
Risk taking: Entrepreneurs must be willing to take risks in order to see results. Often the risk they take is by investing their own savings in the new business.
Innovative entrepreneurs can often create much value for their business as long as their new ideas for goods or services are customer-focused.

@@@Case Study of a Successful Entrepreneur: Bangalore Enterprise
Bangalore enterprise blossoms
Rama Karaturi gained the idea for his rose-growing business when he searched, without success, for a bouquet of roses for his wife in Bangalore. The city was a rose-free zone, so he decided to start growing them himself. Initially, he opened two greenhouses growing just roses. He used his own savings, so took a considerable risk, but his confidence in the growth of flower-giving at times of major festivals encouraged other investors too. He sold the flowers in India, but his business also became one of the first in India to start exporting flowers on a large scale. Rama worked long hours to make his business a success. The business, called Karaturi Networks, has grown at a tremendous rate, helped by Rama’s all-round business skills. He recently bought out a large rose-grower in Kenya and his business is now the world’s largest cultivator of roses – and Rama achieved this in a little over ten years.

@@@Challenges and Decision Making for Entrepreneurs
Major challenges faced by entrepreneurs
Identifying successful business opportunities
Identifying successful business opportunities is one of the most important stages in being an effective entrepreneur. Many people say that they ‘want to work for themselves’, but they do not make the leap into entrepreneurship successfully because they have not been able to identify a market need that will offer sufficient demand for their product to allow the business to be profitable. The original idea for most new businesses comes from one of several sources including:
■ Own skills or hobbies – e.g. dress-making or car bodywork repairing. Very often, these skills will enable an entrepreneur to offer them to friends and relatives and this could be the start of the business.
■ Previous employment experience – working for a successful hairdresser, for example, allows a potential entrepreneur to see the working of such a business and judge whether they could set up a similar business themselves.
■ Franchising conferences and exhibitions – these offer a wide range of new business start-up ideas, e.g. fast-food restaurants, which also give the potential benefits of the support of a much larger franchiser business.
■ Small-budget market research – the Internet allows any user to browse business directories to see how many businesses there are in the local area offering certain goods or services. Such small-scale research might indicate gaps in local markets that could be profitably filled by the entrepreneur.

@@@Financial Considerations for New Ventures 
Sourcing capital (finance)
Once the entrepreneur has decided on the business idea or opportunity, the next task is to raise the necessary capital. In an International Labour Organization survey of new business start-ups, the problem of finance came top of the list of replies from entrepreneurs regarding the main difficulty. So why is obtaining finance such a major problem for entrepreneurs?
■ Lack of sufficient own finance – many entrepreneurs have very limited personal savings, especially if they are setting up their own business because they were previously made redundant.
■ Lack of awareness of the financial support and grants available.
■ Lack of any trading record to present to banks as evidence of past business success – a trading record would tend to give a bank confidence when deciding to lend money or not for a new venture.
■ A poorly produced business plan that fails to convince potential investors of the chances of a business’s success.

@@@Locational Strategies and Competitive Challenges
Determining a location
Perhaps the most important consideration when choosing the location for a new business is the need to minimise fixed costs. When finance is limited, it is very important to try to keep the break-even level of output – the output level that earns enough revenue to cover all costs – as low as possible. This will greatly increase the business’s chances of survival. Operating from home is the most common way for entrepreneurs to establish their business. This has the great advantage of keeping costs low, but there are drawbacks:
■ It may not be close to the area with the biggest market potential.
■ It lacks status – a business with its own prestigious premises tends to generate confidence.
■ It may cause family tensions.
■ It may be difficult to separate private life from working life.
The cost and position of the location chosen could have a big impact on the business entrepreneur’s chance of success.
New businesses that offer a consumer service need to consider location very carefully. Whereas a website designer could operate from home very effectively, as communication with customers will be by electronic means, a hairdresser may need to consider obtaining premises in an area with the biggest number of potential customers. An alternative is to visit customers in their own homes – this way, the entrepreneur may avoid the costs of buying or renting their own premises altogether. 

@@@Navigating Market Dynamics and Building Customer Relationships
Competition
This is nearly always a problem for new enterprises unless the business idea is so unique that no other business has anything quite like it. A newly created business will often experience competition from older, established businesses, with more resources and more market knowledge. The entrepreneur may have to offer better customer service to overcome the cost and pricing advantages that bigger businesses can usually offer.

@@@Strategies for Attaining and Retaining Customers
Building a customer base
This is linked to the previous point about competition. To survive, a new firm must establish itself in the market and build up customer numbers as quickly as possible. The long-term strength of the business will depend on encouraging customers to return to purchase products again and again. Many small businesses try to encourage this by offering a better service than their larger and better-funded competitors. This better service might include:
■ personal customer service
■ knowledgeable pre- and after-sales service
■ providing for one-off customer requests that larger firms may be reluctant to provide for.

@@@Analyzing Causes of New Business Failures
Why do new businesses often fail?
Even if an entrepreneur has all of the qualities listed above, success with a new business can never be guaranteed. In fact, many businesses fail during their first year of operation. The most common reasons for new enterprises failing are:
demand for their product to allow the business to be profitable. The original idea for most new businesses comes from one of several sources including:
■ Own skills or hobbies – e.g. dress-making or car bodywork repairing. Very often, these skills will enable an entrepreneur to offer them to friends and relatives and this could be the start of the business.
■ Previous employment experience – working for a successful hairdresser, for example, allows a potential entrepreneur to see the working of such a business and judge whether they could set up a similar business themselves.
■ Franchising conferences and exhibitions – these offer a wide range of new business start-up ideas, e.g. fast-food restaurants, which also give the potential benefits of the support of a much larger franchiser business.
■ Small-budget market research – the Internet allows any user to browse business directories to see how many businesses there are in the local area offering certain goods or services. Such small-scale research might indicate gaps in local markets that could be profitably filled by the entrepreneur."
75,"@@@Lack of Record Keeping: Impact on Business Failure
The lack of accurate records is a significant factor contributing to business failure. Entrepreneurs often undervalue record-keeping, either because they prioritize meeting customer needs over maintaining records, or because they mistakenly believe they can remember all business details. As time progresses, the ability to recall specific details like the next flower delivery for a florist, whether payments for services have been made, if a cheque has been deposited, or hours staff have worked, becomes increasingly difficult. Maintaining precise and current records of business transactions and other related matters is critical. With the affordability of computers, most businesses use digital record-keeping, but it is recommended to also keep paper records, such as supplier receipts or large delivery details. These physical records can provide a backup in case of computer failure and serve as proof during tax audits if discrepancies arise.

@@@Lack of Cash and Working Capital: Leading Cause of Business Closure
A common cause for new business failures within the first year is the shortage of working capital. Capital is essential for managing daily cash flow, maintaining inventory, and offering trade credit to customers who then turn into trade receivables. Inadequate working capital could prevent the business from purchasing supplies, settling debts, or extending credit, which could ultimately result in the venture shutting down. To avoid serious working capital deficiencies, certain measures are advisable, such as creating a cash flow forecast, establishing good banking relations, ensuring initial capital suffices to cover initial operation months, and enforcing effective credit control.

@@@Poor Management Skills: Barrier to Entrepreneurial Success
While most entrepreneurs possess some work experience, it might not be at a managerial level, potentially lacking in leadership, cash management, planning, coordination, decision-making, communication, marketing, promotion, and selling skills. Entrepreneurs might have the drive and proficiency in their chosen field, like a talented chef opening a restaurant, but may be inexperienced in management. While some improve their management skills quickly, it's risky to rely on this. To mitigate the risk, entrepreneurs can seek advice, take up training, or hire experienced management staff, although the latter can be costly for new businesses. Relying solely on enthusiasm and hard work without proper management skills can lead to failure, thus highlighting the importance of acquiring management experience beforehand.

@@@Changes in the Business Environment: Threat to Stability
Establishing a new business is fraught with risk because of the ever-changing business landscape. Beyond the already mentioned hurdles, businesses must adapt to significant changes that could jeopardize their initial business concepts. Acknowledging change as a central theme in Business studies, the text underscores that businesses may fail due to unforeseen shifts in the environment. The importance of recognizing and planning for change is thus crucial for the survival and success of new enterprises. This concept is further explored in Unit 6, Chapter 40, which focuses on change as a critical element of the business environment."
