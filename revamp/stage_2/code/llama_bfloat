["\nOutput:  @@@Rubber Band Stretching: A Force-Extension Graph\nA force\u2013extension graph for a rubber band can be obtained in a similar manner to the experiment with the spring, but an alternative method is shown in Figure 13.7. It is important that safety glasses are worn to reduce the risk of eye damage when the band breaks. It is best to use a short, thin rubber band, as it will stretch to several times its original length and thick bands are difficult to break. To alter the length of the band, the boss is loosened and moved up the stand. The force at each extension is read off the newton-meter.\n\nThe rubber band stretches very easily at first, reaching a length of three or four times its original value (Figure 13.8). It then becomes very stiff and difficult to stretch as it approaches its breaking point. Figure 13.7 illustrates the process of stretching a rubber band, with a ruler, newton-meter, and a rubber band.\n\n@@@Understanding Natural Rubber's Behavior\nNatural rubber is a polymer. It contains long chains of atoms that are normally tangled in a disordered fashion (like strands of spaghetti). Relatively small forces are needed to \u2018untangle\u2019 these molecules so a large extension is produced for small loads. When the chains are fully extended, additional forces need to stretch the bonds between the atoms, so much smaller extensions are produced for a given load; the rubber becomes stiffer.\n\nIt should be noted that the band returns to its original length if the force is removed at any stage prior to breaking \u2013 that is, the rubber band is elastic.\n\n@@@Force-Compression Graphs: An Overview of Material Behavior\nForce\u2013compression graphs are used to understand the behavior of materials under compressive forces. Up to now, we have considered only the behavior of materials that have been subjected to stretching \u2013 or tensile forces. If weights were placed on a large rectangular sponge, the sponge would be noticeably squashed and force\u2013compression readings easily measured. This is much more difficult for metals. Whereas long thin samples of copper wire can be extended by several centimeters with tensile forces of 50 N or less, the shorter, thicker samples needed for compression tests require much larger forces to produce measurable compressions.\n\nIn engineering laboratories, large hydraulic presses are used, but a school\u2019s compression testing kit, shown in Figure 13.9, can demonstrate the effects of compression on a range of sample materials. ", "\nOutput:  @@@Nature of Waves\nThe text in this section describes the concept of waves and oscillations, specifically the idea of phase and antiphase relationships between oscillating particles. It introduces the key term \"phase,\" which refers to the position within a cycle that a particle occupies relative to the onset of the cycle. This concept is illustrated using a visual representation of a mass on a spring undergoing oscillation, highlighting how the position of the mass changes throughout the cycle. The text also explains that oscillations which are half a cycle out of step are said to be in antiphase, and that the phase difference between oscillations can be described in terms of radians and degrees.\n\n@@@Phase Relationships and Displacement\u2013Distance Graphs\nThe text then goes on to discuss the visual representation of oscillations on a displacement\u2013distance graph, which is a snapshot of a wave's profile at a given moment in time. It explains how this graph can be used to represent the positions of particles along the surface of the wave at that time. The text also mentions the relationship between the phase difference and the wave's displacement\u2013distance graph, showing how the different phases appear on the graph. \n\n@@@Visualizing Waves with Displacement\u2013Distance Graphs\nThe text further explores the concept by using an analogy of a water wave travelling along the surface of a glass-sided aquarium. It explains that a snapshot of the edge of the wave taken through the glass can be represented on a displacement\u2013distance graph, which reveals the positions of the particles along the wave's surface at that instant. The text also mentions the role of the wavelength in this representation, providing visual cues to help understand the concepts of phase and antiphase. ", "\nOutput:  @@@Introduction to Electromagnetic Waves\nElectric and magnetic fields will be studied in some detail in the Year 2  Student\u2019s book, but you should be aware that the fields do not require a material medium and that varying electric fields cannot exist without associated magnetic fields and vice versa. Electromagnetic waves can be detected when they pass over charged particles. Some of their energy is transferred to the particles, which makes them vibrate at the frequency of the wave.\n\n@@@Properties of Electromagnetic Waves\nElectromagnetic waves can also occur as a result of \u2018quantum jumps\u2019 of electrons in atoms or from \u2018excited\u2019 nuclei. The waves produced in this manner are emitted as photons, which are \u2018bundles\u2019 of waves of a few nanoseconds duration that have wavelengths dependent on their energy. The photon nature of light will be investigated in Chapter 17.\n\n@@@The Complete Range of Electromagnetic Waves\nThe complete range of electromagnetic waves and some of their properties are given in Table 14.1. You will have come across this material during your GCSE studies, so this is a useful reminder!\n\n@@@Understanding Electromagnetic Waves\nMechanical waves are initiated by vibrating objects passing on some of their energy to the atoms or molecules of a material medium. Electromagnetic waves are created when charged particles are accelerated. Radio waves are an example of electromagnetic radiation. Electrons in an aerial are made to oscillate using electronic circuitry, and this produces a wave of continuously varying electric and magnetic fields with the same frequency as the oscillator. The electric field variations are in the plane of the antenna, with the magnetic field in a plane at right angles to it, as shown in Figure 14.14.\n\n@@@Visualization of Electromagnetic Waves\nB E \nDistance\nmagnetic field oscillation\n(vertical)electric field oscillation\n(horizontal)\nFigure 14.14 Electromagnetic wave. ", "\nOutput:  @@@Superposition of Waves and Standing Waves in Strings\nWhen a pulse is sent along a rope that is fixed at one end, the reflected pulse is out of phase with the incident pulse. A phase change of \u03c0 radians (180 \u00b0) takes place at the point of reflection (Figure 16.12). This means that destructive interference will occur and the fixed position will (not surprisingly) be a node. Standing waves in a string can be investigated using Melde\u2019s experiment (Figure 16.13). A thin length of string is attached to an oscillator, passed over a pulley wheel and kept taut by a weight hanging from its end. The frequency of the oscillator is adjusted until nodes and antinodes are clearly visible. A strobe lamp can be used to \u2018slow down\u2019 the motion so that the standing wave can be studied in more detail. The wavelength of the wave is found by measuring the distance between alternate nodes. Figure 16.12 illustrates reflection of a wave in a string before and after reflection, with oscillator, strobe lamp, and a diagram of Melde\u2019s experiment. Standing waves of shorter or longer wavelength are observed if the frequency of the oscillator is increased or decreased or the weight on the string is altered. The speed of the incident and reflected waves in the string can be calculated using v = f \u03bb. An investigation into how this depends on the tension or thickness of the string can be performed.\n\n@@@Stringed Instruments\nStringed instruments such as guitars, violins, and pianos all produce standing waves on strings stretched between two points. When plucked, bowed, or struck, the energy in the standing wave is transferred to the air around it and generates a sound. Because the string interacts with only a small region of air, the sound needs to be amplified\u2014either by a resonating sound box or electronically. The principle of stringed instruments can be demonstrated using a sonometer (Figure 16.14). When the string is plucked at its midpoint, the waves reflected from each end will interfere to set up a standing wave in the string. As both ends are fixed, they must be nodes, so the simplest standing wave will have one antinode between two nodes\u2014that is, the length of the string will be half a wavelength. Using the expression v = T\u03bc and the wave equation, v = f \u03bb, the frequency of the note emitted by the wire in this mode will be f = v \u03bb = 1 2l T\u03bc. Figure 16.14 shows a diagram of a sonometer, including a sound box, moveable bridges, and a weight. A safety note is included, advising to avoid frequencies in the range 5 \u201330 Hz as they may trigger epileptic fits in some individuals. ", "\nOutput:  @@@Introduction to Diffraction\nWhen a wave passes through a gap or is partially obstructed by a barrier, the wavefront spreads out into the \u2018shadow\u2019 region (Figure 16.20a). This effect is called diffraction and is easily demonstrated using a ripple tank. The dark and light lines represent crests and troughs on the surface of the water, and can therefore be considered as wavefronts. If the oscillator in a ripple tank is adjusted to a higher frequency, the wavelength shortens and the spreading is reduced. Narrowing the aperture of the gap between two barriers causes even more spreading of the wave (Figure 16.20b). When the width is similar to the wavelength, the wavefronts are almost circular.\n\n@@@Explanation of Diffraction using Huygens' Construction\nDiffraction can be explained using Huygens\u2019 construction (shown in Figure 16.21). Huygens considered every point on a wavefront as the source of secondary spherical wavelets which spread out with the wave velocity. The new wavefront is the envelope of these secondary wavelets. When a wavefront is obstructed by a slit or an obstacle, the secondary wavelets at the edges are transmitted into the geometrical shadow causing the diffraction spreading. In some instances patterns can be seen due to the interference of imagined point sources on the wavefront as it passes through the slit or around the obstruction. Figures 16.22 (a) and (c) show how the secondary wavelets at S1 and S2 spill over into the geometrical shadow. Figure 16.22 (b) illustrates how the wavefront in a very narrow aperture behaves as a single source of a secondary wavelet.\n\n@@@Observation of Diffraction in Everyday Life\nFigure 16.20 Wave diffraction experiment. a wavefront is obstructed by a slit or an obstacle, the secondary wavelets at the edges are transmitted into the geometrical shadow causing the diffraction spreading. In some instances patterns can be seen due to the interference of imagined point sources on the wavefront as it passes through the slit or around the obstruction. Figures 16.22 (a) and (c) show how the secondary wavelets at S1 and S2 spill over into the geometrical shadow. Figure 16.22 (b) illustrates how the wavefront in a very narrow aperture behaves as a single source of a secondary wavelet. Figure 16.22 (b) illustrates how the wavefront in a very narrow aperture behaves as a single source of a secondary wavelet. Short-wave radio and television signals do not diffract significantly into valleys or around the curvature of the Earth\u2019s surface, but military communications radio sends out signals with wavelengths of several kilometres that can be detected by submarines almost halfway around the world.\n\n@@@Investigation of Diffraction Patterns\nClose inspection of the water waves on the ripple tank emerging from the narrow aperture in Figure 16.20b reveals regions of constructive and destructive superposition at the edges of the circular wavefront. This effect can be further investigated using a microwave kit (Figure 16.23). The transmitter is placed about 20 cm from a pair of aluminium sheets and directed at a gap of about 5 cm. The receiver is placed facing the aperture and about 50 cm away from the other side of the sheets. The output from the receiver is measured at the midpoint and at 10 \u00b0 intervals as it is moved along a semi-circular path. The diffraction pattern shows a central maximum edged by a series of lower intensity maxima and minima as opposed to the regular pattern of interference from a double slit. The central maximum will broaden when the slit width is reduced. It can be shown that, for a slit of width a, the angle \u03b8 between the central maximum and the first minimum is given by the equation: sin \u03b8 = \u03bb a In general, to create a diffraction pattern using a slit, the wavelength should be of the same order of magnitude as the width of the slit. Patterns can be seen for slightly wider slits but the value of \u03b8 becomes smaller. For angles of less than about 10 \u00b0, the approximation sin \u03b8 = tan \u03b8 = \u03b8 radians can be used. \n\n@@@Conclusion\n807527_C16_Edexcel_Physics_247-273.indd   261 24/02/2015   14:28 ### "]
