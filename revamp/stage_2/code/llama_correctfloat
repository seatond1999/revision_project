["\nOutput:  @@@Experimental Method for Measuring Force\u2013Extension of Rubber Bands\nA force\u2013extension graph for a rubber band can be obtained in a similar manner to the experiment with the spring, but an alternative method is shown in Figure 13.7. Safety note: It is important that safety glasses are worn to reduce the risk of eye damage when the band breaks. It is best to use a short, thin rubber band, as it will stretch to several times its original length and thick bands are difficult to break. To alter the length of the band, the boss is loosened and moved up the stand. The force at each extension is read off the newton-meter. The rubber band stretches very easily at first, reaching a length of three or four times its original value (Figure 13.8). It then becomes very stiff and difficult to stretch as it approaches its breaking point. Figure 13.7 Stretching a rubber band.\n\n@@@Understanding the Elastic Properties of Natural Rubber\nNatural rubber is a polymer. It contains long chains of atoms that are normally tangled in a disordered fashion (like strands of spaghetti). Relatively small forces are needed to \u2018untangle\u2019 these molecules so a large extension is produced for small loads. When the chains are fully extended, additional forces need to stretch the bonds between the atoms, so much smaller extensions are produced for a given load; the rubber becomes stiffer. It should be noted that the band returns to its original length if the force is removed at any stage prior to breaking \u2013 that is, the rubber band is elastic.\n\n@@@The Analysis of Force\u2013Compression in Materials\nForce\u2013compression graphs are crucial in understanding the behavior of materials under compressive forces. Up to now, we have considered only the behavior of materials that have been subjected to stretching \u2013 or tensile forces. If weights were placed on top of a large rectangular sponge, the sponge would be noticeably squashed and force\u2013compression readings easily measured. This is much more difficult for metals. Whereas long thin samples of copper wire can be extended by several centimeters with tensile forces of 50 N or less, the shorter, thicker samples needed for compression tests require much larger forces to produce measurable compressions. In engineering laboratories, large hydraulic presses are used, but a school\u2019s compression testing kit, shown in Figure 13.9, can demonstrate the effects of compression on a range of sample materials.\n\n@@@Visualizing the Force\u2013Compression Graph for a Rubber Band\nForce\u2013compression curves for a rubber band are characterized by a large initial compression, followed by a steep increase in force required for further compression. This is due to the fact that the polymer chains in the rubber are relatively easy to compress when they are not fully extended. Once the chains are fully extended, additional forces are required to compress the actual atomic bonds within the polymer.\n\n@@@The Importance of Compression Testing in Material Science\nThe study of compression behavior in materials is vital in understanding the mechanical properties of a material and its potential applications. Compression tests are often used in engineering to evaluate the suitability of a material for a specific purpose, such as its ability to withstand compressive stresses in structural applications. ", "\nOutput:  @@@ Nature of Waves and Phase\nFigure 14.9 shows a mass on a spring undergoing one complete oscillation and the positions of the mass after successive intervals of one quarter of a period. Halfway through the cycle, the mass is moving through the midpoint in the opposite direction to the starting position. The oscillations at these points are out of step with each other or \u2018out of phase\u2019. Any two oscillations that are half a cycle out of step are said to be in antiphase. At the end of the cycle, the mass is moving through the midpoint in the same direction as at the start and the vibrations are now back in phase.\n\nKey term The phase of an oscillation refers to the position within a cycle that the particle occupies relative to the onset of the cycle.\n\nvv vv = 0\nT = period of oscillation t = 0 t = T\n4t = T\nv = 0 t = T\n2t = T\n43\nFigure 14.9 Phases of an oscillation.\n\nIf you consider the oscillations in Figure 14.9 to be five separate masses, you will note that masses 1 and 5 are always in phase, mass 3 is in antiphase with both 1 and 5 and masses 2 and 4 are one quarter of a cycle and three quarters of a cycle out of phase with mass 1.\n\nFor a sinusoidal waveform, one cycle represents 2 \u03c0 radians (360 \u00b0), so oscillations that are in antiphase are said to have a phase difference of \u03c0 radians (180 \u00b0), while those that differ by one quarter and three quarters of a cycle are \u03c02 radians (90 \u00b0) and 3\u03c02 radians (270 \u00b0) out of phase, respectively.\n\nThe phase relationships of masses 1\u20135 are represented on the displacement\u2013time graphs in Figure 14.10.\n\n@@@ Displacement\u2013Distance Graphs\nImagine a water wave travelling along the surface of a glass-sided aquarium. A snapshot of the edge of the wave viewed through the glass would reveal a wave profile showing the shape of the surface at that instant.

Electromagnetic waves can be  detected when they pass over charged particles. Some of their energy is  transferred to the particles, which makes them vibrate at the frequency of  the wave. Electromagnetic waves can also occur as a result of \u2018quantum jumps\u2019 of  electrons in atoms or from \u2018excited\u2019 nuclei. The waves produced in this  manner are emitted as photons , which are \u2018bundles\u2019 of waves of a few  nanoseconds duration that have wavelengths dependent on their energy. The  photon nature of light will be investigated in Chapter 17.\n\n@@@Electromagnetic Waves and Properties\nThe complete range of electromagnetic waves and some of their properties  are given in Table 14.1. You will have come across this material during your  GCSE studies, so this is a useful reminder!\n\n@@@Formation of Electromagnetic Waves\nMechanical waves are initiated by vibrating objects passing on some of their  energy to the atoms or molecules of a material medium. Electromagnetic  waves are created when charged particles are accelerated. Radio waves are  an example of electromagnetic radiation. Electrons in an aerial are made to oscillate using electronic circuitry, and this produces a wave of  continuously varying electric and magnetic fields with the same frequency as the  oscillator. The electric field variations are in the plane of the antenna, with the  magnetic field in a plane at right angles to it, as shown in Figure 14.14.\n\n@@@Visualization of Electromagnetic Waves\nFigure 14.14 Electromagnetic wave. B E  Distance  magmatic field oscillation (vertical)electric field oscillation (horizontal)\n\nThe figure illustrates an electromagnetic wave with the electric field oscillations in the plane of the antenna and the magnetic field oscillations in a plane at right angles to it. The figure also shows the distance, which is not explicitly stated in the text but is implied by the figure's scale.\n\n@@@Conclusion\nThe text concludes without a clear indication of the next topic, so no further subsection is created for this point in the text. ", "\nOutput:  @@@Superposition of Waves and Standing Waves in Strings\nWhen a pulse is sent along a rope that is fixed at one end, the reflected pulse is out of phase with the incident pulse. A phase change of \u03c0 radians (180 \u00b0) takes place at the point of reflection (Figure 16.12). This means that destructive interference will occur and the fixed position will (not surprisingly) be a node. Standing waves in a string can be investigated using Melde\u2019s experiment (Figure 16.13). A thin length of string is attached to an oscillator, passed over a pulley wheel and kept taut by a weight hanging from its end. The frequency of the oscillator is adjusted until nodes and antinodes are clearly visible. A strobe lamp can be used to \u2018slow down\u2019 the motion so that the standing wave can be studied in more detail. The wavelength of the wave is found by measuring the distance between alternate nodes. Standing waves of shorter or longer wavelength are observed if the frequency of the oscillator is increased or decreased or the weight on the string is altered. The speed of the incident and reflected waves in the string can be calculated using v = f \u03bb. An investigation into how this depends on the tension or thickness of the string can be performed.\n\n@@@Stringed Instruments and the Principle of Standing Waves\nStringed instruments such as guitars, violins and pianos all produce standing waves on strings stretched between two points. When plucked, bowed or struck, the energy in the standing wave is transferred to the air around it and generates a sound. Because the string interacts with only a small region of air, the sound needs to be amplified \u2013 either by a resonating sound box or electronically. The principle of stringed instruments can be demonstrated using a sonometer (Figure 16.14). When the string is plucked at its midpoint, the waves reflected from each end will interfere to set up a standing wave in the string. As both ends are fixed, they must be nodes, so the simplest standing wave will have one antinode between two nodes \u2013 that is, the length of the string will be half a wavelength. Using the expression v = T\u03bc and the wave equation, v = f \u03bb, the frequency of the note emitted by the wire in this mode will be f = v\u03bb = 12lT\u03bc. A safety note: Frequencies in the range 5 \u201330 Hz should be avoided as they may trigger epileptic fits in some individuals. ", "\nOutput:  @@@Introduction to Diffraction\nWhen a wave passes through a gap or is partially obstructed by a barrier, the wavefront spreads out into the \u2018shadow\u2019 region (Figure 16.20a). This effect is called diffraction and is easily demonstrated using a ripple tank. The dark and light lines represent crests and troughs on the surface of the water, and can therefore be considered as wavefronts.\n\n@@@Frequency and Aperture Effects on Diffraction\nIf the oscillator in a ripple tank is adjusted to a higher frequency, the wavelength shortens and the spreading is reduced. Narrowing the aperture of the gap between two barriers causes even more spreading of the wave (Figure 16.20b). When the width is similar to the wavelength, the wavefronts are almost circular.\n\n@@@Explanation of Diffraction Using Huygens\u2019 Construction\nDiffraction can be explained using Huygens\u2019 construction (shown in Figure 16.21). Huygens considered every point on a wavefront as the source of secondary spherical wavelets which spread out with the wave velocity. The new wavefront is the envelope of these secondary wavelets.\n\n@@@Interference and Patterns in Diffraction\nWhen a wavefront is obstructed by a slit or an obstacle, the secondary wavelets at the edges are transmitted into the geometrical shadow causing diffraction spreading. In some instances, patterns can be seen due to the interference of imagined point sources on the wavefront as it passes through the slit or around the obstruction. Figures 16.22 (a) and (c) show how the secondary wavelets at S1 and S2 spill over into the geometrical shadow. Figure 16.22 (b) illustrates how the wavefront in a very narrow aperture behaves as a single source of a secondary wavelet.\n\n@@@Applications of Diffraction in Radio Waves\nShort-wave radio and television signals do not diffract significantly into valleys or around the curvature of the Earth\u2019s surface, but military communications radio sends out signals with wavelengths of several kilometres that can be detected by submarines almost halfway around the world.\n\n@@@Experimental Analysis of Diffraction Using a Microwave Kit\nClose inspection of the water waves on the ripple tank emerging from the narrow aperture in Figure 16.20b reveals regions of constructive and destructive superposition at the edges of the circular wavefront. This effect can be further investigated using a microwave kit (Figure 16.23). The transmitter is placed about 20 cm from a pair of aluminium sheets and directed at a gap of about 5 cm. The receiver is placed facing the aperture and about 50 cm away from the other side of the sheets. The output from the receiver is measured at the midpoint and at 10 \u00b0 intervals as it is moved along a semi-circular path.\n\n@@@Theoretical Analysis of Diffraction Patterns\nThe diffraction pattern shows a central maximum edged by a series of lower intensity maxima and minima as opposed to the regular pattern of interference from a double slit. The central maximum will broaden when the slit width is reduced. It can be shown that, for a slit of width a, the angle \u03b8 between the central maximum and the first minimum is given by the equation: sin \u03b8 = \u03bb/a. In general, to create a diffraction pattern using a slit, the wavelength should be of the same order of magnitude as the width of the slit. Patterns can be seen for slightly wider slits but the value of \u03b8 becomes smaller. For angles of less than about 10 \u00b0, the approximation sin \u03b8 = tan \u03b8 = \u03b8 radians can be used.
