As well as being found in all vertebrates, haemoglobin is found in earthworms, starfish, some insects, some plants and even in some bacteria.Haemoglobin Saturation Depends on the Partial Pressure of Oxygen1) The partial pressure of oxygen (p02) is a measure of oxygen concentration.The greater the concentration of dissolved oxygen in cells, the higher the partial pressure.2) Similarly, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pC02) is a measure of the concentration of CO, in a cell.3) Haemoglobin's affinity for oxygen varies depending on the partial pressure of oxygen:Oxygen loads onto haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin where there's a hi;Oxyhaemoglobin unloads its oxygen where there's a lower p02.4) Oxygen enters blood capillaries at the alveoli in the lungs. Alveoli have a high p02 so oxygen loads onto haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin.5) When cells respire, they use up oxygen \u2014 this lowers the pOr Red blood cells deliver oxyhaemoglobin to respiring tissues, where it unloads its oxygen6) The haemoglobin then returns to the lungs to pick up more oxygen.There was no use pretending \u2014 the partial pressure of CH., had just increased, and Keith knew who was to blame.Dissociation Curves Show How Affinity for Oxygen VariesA dissociation curve shows how saturated the haemoglobin is with oxygen at any given partial pressure.slll I I M M I III W I I I I I I II I \/\/,- 100% saturation means C- every haemoglobin molecule f~ is carrying the maximum -- of 4 molecules of oxygen. \u2014'\/1 I II I I M I II II M J 1 I II I I I IX\\U I I I II H I I I M I II M I I I M I l\/y- 0% saturation means none 3r of the haemoglobin molecules 5are carrying any oxygen. -\"'n I I M I i w I I I I II II 11 n I I 11The graph is 'S-shaped' because when haemoglobin (Hb) combines with the first 02 molecule, its shape alters in a way that makes it easier for other molecules to join too. But as the Hb starts to become saturated, it gets harder for more oxygen molecules to join. As a result, the curve has a steep bit in the middle where it's really easy for oxygen molecules to join, and shallow bits at each end where it's harder. When the curve is steep, a small change in p02 causes a big change in the amount of oxygen carried by the Hb.D.'Sg.o.g^i.p.D..Cv.rve,fpr..A<jM.ltHuman Haemoglobin\n\u201cI----1------1----r2 4 6 8 10partial pressure of 02 \/ kPaWhere p02 is high (e.g. in the lungs), haemoglobin has a high affinity for oxygen (i.e. it will readily combine with oxygen), so it has a high saturation of oxygen.Where p02 is low (e.g. in respiring tissues), haemoglobin has a low affinity for oxygen, which means it releases oxygen rather than combines with it. That's why it has a low saturation of oxygen.\nTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n","1":"96Classification of OrganismsFor hundreds of years people have been putting organisms into groups to make it easier to recognise and name them. For example, my brother is a member of the species Idioto bigearian (Latin for idiots with big ears).Phylogeny Tells Us About the Evolutionary History of Organisms1)2)3)First branch point- Orangutan- Human-Chimpanzee -Bonobo4)5)Phylogeny is the study of the evolutionary history of groups of organisms.Phylogeny tells us who's related to whom and how closely related they are.All organisms have evolved from shared common ancestors (relatives).This can be shown on a \u2014^phylogenetic tree, like this one. l \u2014\u2014\u20147\/This tree shows the relationship between members of the Hominidae family (great apes and humans).The first branch point represents a common ancestor of all the family members.This ancestor is now extinct. Orangutans were the first group to diverge (evolve to become a different species) from this common ancestor.Each of the following branch points represents another common ancestor from which a different group diverged. Gorillas diverged next, then humans, closely followed by bonobos and chimpanzees.Closely related species diverged away from each other most recently. E.g. humans and chimpanzees are closely related, as they diverged very recently. You can see this because their branches are close together.\u0000 Gorilla\nClassification is All About Grouping Together Related OrganismsTaxonomy is the science of classification. It involves naming organisms and organising them into groups.This makes it easier to identify and study them. Scientists now take into account phylogeny when classifying organisms, and group organisms according to their evolutionary relationships.1) There are eight levels of groups used to classify organisms.These groups are called taxa. Each group is called a taxon.2) The groups are arranged in a hierarchy, with the largest groups at the top and the smallest groups at the bottom.Organisms can only belong to one group at each level in the hierarchy \u2014 there's no overlap.3) Organisms are first sorted into three large groups (or taxa) called domains \u2014 the Eukarya, Bacteria and Archaea.4) Related organisms in a domain are then sorted into slightly smaller groups called kingdoms, e.g. all animalsare in the animal kingdom. More closely related organisms from that kingdom are then groupedinto a phylum, then grouped into a class, and so on down the eight levels of the hierarchy.DomainKingdomPhylumClassOrderFamilyGenusSpecies- You need to learn -\"ames andorder of the groups -5)6)As you move down the hierarchy, there are more groups at each level but fewer organisms in each group. The organisms in each group also become more closely related.The hierarchy ends with species \u2014 the groups that contain only one type of organism (e.g. humans, dogs, E. coll). You need to learn the definition of a species:A species is a group of similar organisms able to reproduce to give fertile offspring.7) Scientists constantly update classification systems because of discoveries about new species and new evidence about known organisms (e.g. DNA sequence data \u2014 see page 98).Topic 4B \u2014 Diversity, Classification and Variation\n","2":"187Stem CellsCardiomyocytes Can be Made from Unipotent Stem Cells1) Cardiomyocytes are heart muscle cells that make up a lot of the tissue in our hearts.In mature mammals, it's thought that they can't divide to replicate themselves.2) This meant that for ages, everyone thought that we weren't able to regenerate our own heart cells at all. This is a major problem if the heart becomes damaged, e.g. by a heart attack, or the cells became worn out through age. Recent research however, has suggested that our hearts dohave some regenerative capability.3) Some scientists now think that old or damaged cardiomyocytes can be replaced by new cardiomyocytes derived from a small supply of unipotent stem cells in the heart.4) Some researchers think that this process could be constantly occurring,but haven't yet agreed on how quickly it happens.\u2022 Some believe that it's a really slow process and that it's possible that somecardiomyocytes are never replaced throughout a person's entire lifetime.\u2022 Others think that it's occurring more quickly, so that everycardiomyocyte in the heart is replaced several times in a lifetime.Stem Cells Can be Used to Treat Human DisordersSince stem cells can divide into a range of specialised cell types, doctors and scientists think they could be used to replace cells damaged by illness or injury.Some Stem Cell Therapies Already Exist1) Some stem cell therapies already exist for some diseases affecting the blood and immune system.2) Bone marrow contains stem cells that can bccomc specialised to form any type of blood cell. Bone marrow transplants can be used to rcplace the faulty bone marrow in patients that produce abnormal blood cells. The stem cells in the transplanted bone marrow divide and specialise to produce healthy blood cells.3) This technique has been used successfully to treat leukaemia (a cancer of the blood or bone marrow) and lymphoma (a cancer of the lymphatic system).4) It has also been used to treat some genetic disorders, such as sickle-cell anaemia and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID):Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a genetic disorder that affects the immune system. People with SCID have a poorly functioning immune system as their white blood cells (made in the bone marrow from stem cells) are defective. This means they can't defend the body against infections by identifying and destroying microorganisms. So SCID sufferers are extremely susceptible to infections. Treatment with a bone marrow transplant replaces the faulty bone marrow with donor bone marrow that contains stem cells without the faulty genes that cause SCID. These then differentiate to produce functional white blood cells. These cells can identify and destroy invading pathogens, so the immune system functions properly.Stem Cells Could be Used to Treat Other DiseasesScientists are researching the use of stem cells as treatment for lots of conditions, including:\u2022 Spinal cord injuries \u2014 stem cells could be used to replace damaged nerve tissue. n n t,,,, f n \\\\i1'\u2022 Heart disease and damage caused by heart attacks \u2014 ~ These tr\u20acatmentsbwt -stem cells could be used to replace damaged heart tissue. \u201c aren't z\u2022 Bladder conditions \u2014 stem cells could be used to grow whole bladders, ^ ^^dimcal trials.

Without water, \nsubstances could not move around the body. Water is one of  the reactants in the process of  photosynthesis, on which almost all life depends (see fig E). Understanding the properties of  water will help you understand many key systems in living organisms. \nWater is also a major habitat \u2013 it supports more life than any other \npart of  the planet.\n\u25b2 fig E  W ater is vital for life on Earth in many different ways \u2013 in a desert, \nthe smallest amount of water allows plants to grow.\nThe simple chemical formula of  water is H2O. This tells us that \ntwo atoms of  hydrogen are joined to one atom of  oxygen to make \nup each water molecule. However, because the electrons are held closer to the oxygen atom than to the hydrogen atoms, water is a polar molecule (see fig F).\n104.5\u00b0O\u03b42\nH\u03b41H\u03b41\n\u25b2 fig F  A model of a w ater molecule showing dipoles.\nOne major effect of  this polarity is that water molecules form hydrogen  bonds. The slightly negative oxygen atom of  one water \nmolecule will attract the slightly positive hydrogen atoms of  other water molecules in a weak electrostatic attraction called a hydrogen \nbond. Each individual hydrogen bond is weak but there are many of  them so the molecules of  water \u2018stick together\u2019 more than you might expect (see fig G). Water has relatively high melting and boiling points compared with other substances that have molecules of  a similar size because it takes a lot of  energy to break all the hydrogen bonds that hold the molecules together. Hydrogen bonds are important in protein structure (see Sections 1A.5 and 2B.1) \nand in the structure and functioning of  DNA (see Section 2B.3).O\u03b42\nO\u03b42\nH\u03b41H\u03b41H\u03b41H\u03b41\nH\u03b41O\u03b42O\u03b42\nO\u03b42H\u03b41\nH\u03b41\nH\u03b41H\u03b41H\u03b41\n\u25b2 fig G  Hydr ogen bonding in water molecules, based on attraction \nbetween positive and negative dipoles.\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF WATER\nThe properties of  water make it very important in biological \nsystems for many reasons.\n \u2022W ater is a polar solvent. Because it is a polar molecule, many ionic \nsubstances like sodium chloride will dissolve in it (see fig H).  \nMany covalently bonded substances are also polar and will dissolve in water, but often do not dissolve in other covalently bonded solvents such as ethanol. Water also carries other substances, such as starch.

There are around 4000\u201311\n \n000\u00a0per\u00a0mm3 of  blood and there are several different types. \nThey are made in the bone marrow, although some mature in the thymus gland. Their main function is to defend the body against infection. Leucocytes are also very important in the inflammatory response of  the body when an area of  tissue is damaged. They all contain a nucleus and have colourless cytoplasm, although some types contain granules which can be stained. There are several different types of  leucocyte, which you will study further in  Book 2 Chapter 6B. \nPLATELETS\nPlatelets are tiny fragments of  large cells called megakaryocytes, which are found in the bone marrow. There are about 150\n 000\u2013400\n 000 pla\ntelets per mm3 of  blood. They are \ninvolved in blood clotting (see page 35).\nTRANSPORT OF OXYGEN\nThe many haemoglobin molecules that are in the red blood cells transport oxygen. Each haemoglobin molecule is a large globular protein consisting of  four peptide chains, each with an iron-containing prosthetic group. Each group can collect four molecules of  oxygen in a reversible process to form oxyhaemoglobin:\n   Hb + 4O2 \u21cb Hb.4O2   ____________________________________     haemoglobin + oxygen \u21cb oxyhaemoglobin     \nT\nhe first oxygen molecule that binds to the haemoglobin changes \nthe arrangement of  the molecule making it easier for the following oxygen molecules to bind. The final oxygen molecule binds several hundred times faster than the first. The same process happens in reverse when oxygen dissociates from haemoglobin \u2013 it gets progressively harder to remove the oxygen.\nEXAM HINT\nAlways use suitable scientific terms. This is important because it can \nhelp to focus a response clearly.\nWhen the blood enters the lungs, the concentration of  oxygen \nin the red blood cells is relatively low. Oxygen moves into the red blood cells from the air in the lungs by diffusion. The oxygen is collected and bound to the haemoglobin, so the free oxygen concentration in the cytoplasm of  the red blood cells stays low. This maintains a steep concentration gradient from the air in the lungs to the red blood cells, so more and more oxygen diffuses in and joins onto the haemoglobin.The oxygen levels are relatively low in the body tissues. The concentration of  oxygen in the cytoplasm of  the red blood cells is higher than in the surrounding tissue. As a result, oxygen moves out into the body cells by diffusion down its concentration gradient. The haemoglobin molecules give up some of  their oxygen. When you are at rest or exercising gently, only about 25% of  the oxygen carried by the haemoglobin is released into your cells. There is another 75% in reserve in the transport system for when you are very active.\nThe strong affinity of  haemoglobin for oxygen means that a \nsmall change in the proportion of  oxygen in the surrounding environment can have a big effect on the saturation of  the blood with oxygen. So in the lungs, the haemoglobin rapidly gains oxygen and in the tissues, as the oxygen saturation of  the environment falls, oxygen is released rapidly (see fig C).\n0100\n50\nPartial pressure of oxygenAs deoxygenated blood approaches the lungs, the steep part of the curv e\nmeans that a small increase in partial pr essure  causes a large increase in\n% saturation.\nAs oxygenated blood approaches the tissues, a small decre ase in\npartial pressure causes a large decrease in % saturation (i.e. a large\nrelease of oxygen).Percentage saturation of \nhaemoglobin with oxygenhigh partial\npressureof oxygen \u2013the conditionsin the lungs\nthe \u2018predicted\u2019 straight linethe actual sigmoid curve\nlow partial pressure ofoxygen \u2013 the conditionsin the respiring tissues\n\u25b2 fig C  Oxy gen dissociation curve for human haemoglobin\nTRANSPORT OF CARBON DIOXIDE\nWaste carbon dioxide diffuses from the respiring cells of  the \nbody tissues into the blood along a concentration gradient. The reaction of  the carbon dioxide with water is crucial. When carbon dioxide is dissolved in the blood it reacts slowly with the water to form carbonic acid, H\n2CO3. The carbonic acid separates to form \nhydrogen ions H+ and hydrogencarbonate ions HCO3\u2013:\nCO2 + H2O \u21cb H2CO3 \u21cb HCO3\u2013 + H+\nAbout 5% of  the carbon dioxide is carried in solution in the plasma. A further 10\u201320% combines with haemoglobin molecules to make carbaminohaemoglobin. Most of  the carbon dioxide is transported in the cytoplasm of  the red blood cells as hydrogencarbonate ions. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase controls the rate of  the reaction between carbon dioxide and water to produce carbonic acid.\nIn the body tissues, there is a high concentration of  carbon dioxide \nin the blood, so carbonic anhydrase catalyses the formation of  carbonic acid.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

The process is pretty similar to facilitated diffusion (see p. 38) \u2014 a molecule attaches to the carrier protein, the protein changes shape and this moves the molecule across the membrane, releasing it on the other side.There are two main differences between active transport and facilitated diffusion though:1) Active transport usually moves solutes from a low to a high concentration\u2014 in facilitated diffusion, they always move from a high to a low concentration.2) Active transport requires energy \u2014 facilitated diffusion does not.\u2022 ATP is a common source of energy in the cell.

A drop of iodine in potassium iodide is put into each well on a spotting tile. A known concentration of amylase and starch are then mixed together in a test tube. A dropping pipette is used to put a drop of this mixture into one of the wells containing the iodine solution on the spotting tile at regular intervals and the resulting colour is observed. The iodine solution goes dark blue-black when starch is present but remains its normal browny-orange colour when there's no starch around. You can see how fast amylase is working by recording how long it takes for the iodine solution to no longer turn blue-black when starch\/amylase mixture is added. Repeat the experiment using different concentrations of amylase. Make sure that you also repeat the experiment three times at each amylase concentration.The experiments above show you how you can investigate the effects of temperature and enzyme concentration on the rate of enzyme-controlled reactions. You can also alter these experiments to investigate the effect of a different variable, such as pH (by adding a buffer solution with a different pH to each test tube) or substrate concentration (you could use serial dilutions to make substrate solutions with different concentrations).

This can be harmful, which usually means that the mutated allele quickly dies out. However, some mutations can produce alleles that are beneficial to an organism (e.g. a protein is produced that works better than the original), helping the organism to survive in certain environments. When the allele codes for a characteristic that increases the chances of an organism surviving, its frequency within the population can increase. This process is known as natural selection. Here's how it works:1) Not all individuals are as likely to reproduce as each other. There's differential reproductive success in a population \u2014 individuals that have an allele that increases their chance of survival are more likely to survive, reproduce and pass on their genes (including the beneficial allele), than individuals with different alleles.2) This means that a greater proportion of the next generation inherits the beneficial allele.3) They, in turn, are more likely to survive, reproduce and pass on their genes.4) So the frequency of the beneficial allele increases from generation to generation.5) Over generations this leads to evolution as the advantageous alleles become more common in the population.Adaptation and selection are both key factors in evolution \u2014 the gradual change in species over time.Evolution has led to the huge diversity of living organisms on Earth.Natural Selection Leads to Populations Becoming Better AdaptedAdaptations help organisms to survive in their environment. They can be behavioural, physiological or anatomical. Here are some examples:(l) Behavioural adaptations\"Ways an organism acts that increase its chance of survival and reproduction. For example, possums sometimes 'play dead' if they're being threatened by a predator to escape attack.(2} Physiological adaptations\"Processes inside an organism's body that increase its chance of survival. For example, brown bears hibernate over winter. They lower their rate of metabolism (all the chemical reactions taking place in their body). This conserves energy, so they don't need to look for food in the months when it's scarce.3) Anatomical adaptationsStructural features of an organism's body that increase its chance of survival. For example, whales have a thick layer of blubber (fat) which helps them keep warm in the cold sea.Bob and Sue were well adapted to hiding in candyfloss shops.\nPractice QuestionsQ1 What is genetic diversity?Q2 Explain how a genetic bottleneck reduces genetic diversity.Q3 Give an example of a behavioural adaptation.Exam QuestionQ1 Tawny owls show variation in colour.

But the risk is higher for some people than others, depending on their lifestyle and which genes they inherit.\nIt is possible to identify the risk factors that may contribute to \nthe cause of  a disease. Y ou can look at people who have the same factors (e.g. smoking) and compare their risk of  the disease with the average risk for the whole population. Using these techniques, it appears that there are a number of  factors that increase the likelihood that a person will develop atherosclerosis. If  many factors influence your chance of  having a disease, it is called a multifactorial disease. The study of  the patterns of  diseases and their causes is called epidemiology.\nWhen two different sets of  data change together, there may be a \nlink, which is called a correlation. For example, mortality data from a disease such as atherosclerosis may change in a similar pattern to a lifestyle factor such as smoking or lack of  exercise. However, this does not prove that one is the cause of  the other. They could both be caused by something else which would explain why they change in the same way. Correlation is not the same as causation \u2013 further research is always needed to demonstrate a causal link.\nFor example, fig B shows the percentage of  deaths in the  \nUAE from cardiovascular disease each year. It also shows the statistics for obesity and diabetes. This data suggests a possible correlation between obesity and heart disease. \nDeaths from CVD05101520253035404550\nObesePercentage of the population affected\nOverweight Diabetes33%47.5%\n13%31%\n\u25b2 fig B  T his data shows a possible correlation between obesity, diabetes \nand death from cardiovascular disease (CVD).

However, \nthese UAE data agree with findings from countries around the world that suggest obesity is closely linked to the development of  diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Dr Raghib Ali, principle investigator in the UAE Healthy Future Study, has set up a long-term study in Abu Dhabi. The team is aiming to collect the data needed to confirm the pattern of  increased disease risk in the UAE \u2013 and so to find ways of  reducing the risk of  diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\nCHECKPOINT \n1.

This is because temperature and pH affect enzyme activity, and enzymes control the rate of metabolic reactions:\u2022 If body temperature is too high (e.g. 40 \u00b0C) enzymes may becomc denatured. The enzyme's molecules vibrate too much, which breaks the hydrogen bonds that hold them in their 3D shape.The shape of the enzyme's active site is changed and it no longer works as a catalyst.This means metabolic reactions are less efficient.\u2022 If body temperature is too low enzyme activity is reduced, slowing the rate of metabolic reactions.\u2022 The highest rate of enzyme activity happens at their optimum temperature (about 37 \u00b0C in humans).\u2022 If blood pH is too high or too low (highly alkaline or acidic) enzymes become denatured. The hydrogen bonds that hold them in their 3D shape are broken, so the shape of the enzyme's active site is changed and it no longer works as a catalyst. This means metabolic reactions are less efficient.\u2022 The highest rate of enzyme activity happens at their optimum pH \u2014 usually around pH 7 (neutral), but some enzymes work best at other pHs, e.g. enzymes found in the stomach work best at a low pH.5) It's important to maintain the right concentration of glucose in the blood because cells need glucose for energy. Blood glucose concentration also affects the water potential of blood \u2014 this is the potential (likelihood)of water molecules to diffuse out of or into a solution.\u2022 If blood glucose concentration is too high the water potential of blood is reduced to a point where water molecules diffuse out of cells into the blood by osmosis.This can cause the cells to shrivel up and die.\u2022 If blood glucose concentration is too low, cells are unable to carry out normal activities because there isn't enough glucose for respiration to provide energy.Homeostatic Systems Detect a Change and Respond by Negative Feedback1)2)3)4)5)6)Homeostatic systems involve receptors, a communication system and effectors (like the nervous system \u2014 see page 128).Receptors detect when a level is too high or too low, and the information's communicated via the nervous system or the hormonal system to effectors.The effectors respond to counteract the change \u2014 bringing the level back to normal. The mechanism that restores the level to normal is called a negative feedback mechanism.Negative feedback keeps things around the normal level, e.g. body temperature is usually kept within 0.5 \u00b0C above or below 37 \u00b0C.Negative feedback only works within certain limits though \u2014 if the change is too big then the effectors may not be able to counteract it, e.g. a huge drop in body temperature caused by prolonged exposure to cold weather may be too large to counteract.Control of body temperature by negative feedback:body detects temperature's too hotyour internal environment stays around the normal level (37 \u00b0C)body detects temperature's too coldeffectors respond to increase the temperaturetimea>ouJ3u\nTopic 6C \u2014 Homeostasis\n","11":"25Eukaryotic Cells and OrganellesDifferent Organelles have Different FunctionsThis giant table contains a big list of organelles \u2014 you need to know the structure and function of them all.

Why do they do this? \nPREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE \nCardiovascular disease has a negative effect on individuals, on families  and on society. It costs a lot of  money to treat people in hospital. When  people are too ill to work, they are losing money for their families, and  also for the companies where they work. Treating people with drugs to  prevent them from needing surgery is cheaper for health service providers.  It is even cheaper (and better for the individual) if  we can stop ourselves  needing the drugs. So, prevention is better than treatment for CVDs for  many reasons (see fig A). However, persuading people to change their  \nlifestyle habits is often difficult.\nFor example, there is a lot of  reliable evidence to show that smoking is  \none of  the highest risk factors for CVDs. However, if  you stop smoking,  your risk of  developing heart disease is almost halved after just one year.  Moreover, research carried out by a team led by Azra Mahmud from  Trinity College Dublin and published in 2007 suggests that after 10 years,  the arteries of  smokers who stop smoking are the same as if  they had  never smoked. There is a lot of  support available for people who want to  stop smoking. Y et, despite all this, almost 1 billion people around the  world smoke cigarettes and millions of  them die each year of  CVDs and  cancers linked to their smoking. \nHealth education programmes in schools and communities can help to  \nmake sure that everyone is aware of  the risks associated with different  lifestyle choices. However, each individual has to make their own choices  and take their own risks.\nOVERWEIGHT OR UNDERFIT?\nMost people are aware that obesity is linked to CVDs, and many go on  slimming diets to try to lose weight. Most people also know that taking  regular exercise helps protect against CVDs \u2013 but more people choose to  go on a diet than choose to take regular exercise. The results of  a study  carried out over an average of  eight years on 20\n 000 men a\nged from  \n30 to 83 years are given in Section 1C.4 fig\u00a0B. Fitness was defined by  how much oxygen they used during exercise. The results show that if  you  are obese and fit you have a lower risk of  dying from CVDs than someone  who is not obese but unfit. Obviously, being the correct weight and fit is  best of  all! \nThe problem is that many people enjoy their food, and don\u2019t take sufficient exercise. It takes a lot of  \neffort to cut down the amount of  food you eat and change to eating healthier foods including lots of  fruit and vegetables. \u25b2\n fig A  Infogr aphics like this one published in Gulf News help \npeople understand the factors which affect their heart health.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember to read all the \ninformation in graphics.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

One of  the main ways substances move into \nand out of  cells is by diffusion. Diffusion is the free movement of  particles in a liquid or a gas down a concentration gradient. This movement is from an area where the particles are at a relatively high concentration to an area where they are at a relatively low concentration (see Section 2A.2).\nIn single-celled organisms and microscopic multicellular organisms, diffusion is sufficient to supply all their needs. However, when organisms reach a certain size, diffusion alone is not enough.\nTRANSPORT IN SMALL ORGANISMS\nFor a single-celled organism like an amoeba and for very small multicellular organisms including many marine larvae, the nutrients and oxygen that they need can diffuse directly into the cells from the external environment and waste substances can diffuse directly out. This works well for the following reasons.\n \u2022T\nhe diffusion distances from the outside to the innermost areas of  \nthe cells are very small.\n \u2022T\nhe surface area in contact with the outside environment is very \nlarge when compared to the volume of  the inside of  the organism. Its surface area to volume ratio (sa\n :\n v\nol) is large, so there is \na relatively big surface area over which substances can diffuse into or out of  the organism (see figs A and B).\n \u2022T\nhe metabolic demands are low \u2013 the organisms do not regulate \ntheir own temperature and the cells do not use much oxygen and food or produce much carbon dioxide.\nSingle-celled organisms and very small multicellular organisms do not need specialised transport systems because diffusion is enough to supply their needs.\n\u25b2 fig A  T he surface area : volume ratio of this tiny jellyfish larva is relatively \nlarge so simple diffusion can supply all its needs.MODELLING SURFACE AREA\u00a0:\u00a0VOLUME RATIOS\nThe surface area\u00a0to\u00a0volume ratio of  an organism is the key factor \nthat determines whether diffusion alone will allow substances to move into and out of  all the cells rapidly enough. However, it is not easy to calculate the surface area\u00a0to\u00a0volume ratio of  organisms such as elephants, people and palm trees. It is difficult even for a single-celled Amoeba because of  its irregular shape.\nSo scientists use models to help show what happens in the real \nsituation (see fig B). A simple cube makes surface area\u00a0to\u00a0volume calculations easy. The bigger the organism gets, the smaller the surface area\u00a0to\u00a0volume ratio becomes. The distance from the outside of  the organism to the inside gets longer, and there is proportionately less surface for substances to enter through. So it takes longer for substances to diffuse in, and they may not reach the individual cells quickly enough to supply all their needs.\n1 mm cubeLarger surface area\ncompared to volume.\nSurface area 6 sides 3 12\n5 6  mm2\nVolume 13 5 1  mm3\nSurface areato volume rati\no6 : 16 sides 3 22\n5 24  mm2\n23 5 8  mm3\n3 : 16 sides 3 42\n5 96  mm2\n43 5 64  mm3\n3 : 2\nSurface area\n3.14  \u00b5m2\nVolume4\nr 3 4\n3pr 2p\n0.52  \u00b5m3\nSurface area\nto volume rati o6 : 112.57  \u00b5m2\n4.19  \u00b5m3\n3 : 150.27  \u00b5m2\n33.51  \u00b5m3\n3 : 22 mm cube 4 mm cubeSmaller surface area\ncompared to volume.\n0.5 \u00b5m radius 1 \u00b5m 2 \u00b5m\n\u25b2 fig B  In this diagr am, the cubes and spheres represent models  \nof organisms.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that small organisms have a small surface area.

Here are two examples.\nWarfarin is an anticoagulant that interferes with the \nmanufacture of  prothrombin in the body. Low prothrombin levels make the blood clot less easily (see Section 1B.2). Warfarin has been used in rat poison \u2013 in high doses the blood will not clot at all and the rats bleed to death after the slightest injury. In humans, the dose is carefully monitored to make sure that the clotting of  the blood is reduced but not prevented completely. \nPlatelet inhibitory drugs make the platelets less sticky, and \nso reduce the clotting ability of  the blood. The cheapest and most common of  these is aspirin (fig D) but clopidogrel is also commonly used. \n\u25b2 fig D  Aspirin is a r elatively cheap drug. It has been used traditionally  \nas a painkiller. It is also a very effective way of preventing many \ncardiovascular problems.\nThe risks of  taking aspirin are well known \u2013 it irritates the \nstomach lining and causes bleeding in the stomach which can become serious. A combination of  aspirin and clopidogrel can reduce the risk of  developing a range of  cardiovascular diseases by 20\u201325% in some low-risk patients. However, based on data from several studies it appears that, for some patients, the risk of  side-effects is much higher when the two drugs are combined. For example, for every 1000 patients at high risk of  CVDs treated for 28 months, five cardiovascular events would be avoided \u2013 but three major stomach bleeds would be caused. In lower-risk patients, 23 cardiovascular events would be avoided while 10 major bleeds would be caused. It is difficult to achieve the correct balance between preventing the blood from clotting too easily while allowing it to clot when necessary. For example, when people are treated with anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin, they must be monitored very carefully to make sure that they do not bleed internally, particularly in the brain. The decision whether to give warfarin will depend on many factors, including the patient\u2019s age and condition as well as other medication they may be taking.\nCHECKPOINT \n1.

The tissue will feel spongy because of the air trapped in all the alveoli.Lungs from a butcher are safe for humans to handle, but they could still contain bacteria that cause food poisoning. That's why it's important to wash your hands after the dissection and disinfect work surfaces.Here\u2019s How to Dissect Fish Gills in Bony Fish1) Again, make sure you're wearing an apron or lab coat.2) Place your chosen fish (something like a perch or salmon works well) in a dissection tray or on a cutting board.3) Gills are located on either side of the fish's head. They're protected on eachside by a bony flap called an operculum and supported by gill arches.4) To remove the gills, push back the operculum and use scissors to carefully remove the gills. Cut each gill arch through the bone at the top and bottom. They should look a bit like this:5) If you look closely, you should be able to see the gill filaments.N\\\/1 I II I i \/1 I I II I M I I II I II 11 u u 111 i ii I I II I M II I i u I II I II II n I I I I I I I I I 11^- For more nformation about the structure and function of fish gills, see page 56. - 1 w n 11 H ' i u 11 h 11 h 11111111 m i m i m 111 m 111 ii m i w i m 11 m w n ^A single gill archoperculum (the gills are under here)\ngill filamentsTopic 3 A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","17":"144Muscle ContractionMyofilaments sliding over one another takes a lot of energy \u2014 probably why exercise is such hard work...Myosin Filaments Have Globular Heads and Binding Sitestropomyosinactinfilament1) Myosin filaments have globular heads that are hinged, so they can move back and forth.2) Each myosin head has a binding site for actin and a binding site for ATP.3) Actin filaments have binding sites for myosin heads, called actin-myosin binding sites.4) Another protein called tropomyosin is found between actin filaments.It helps myofilaments move past each other.Binding Sites in Resting Muscles are Blocked by Tropomyosin1) In a resting (unstimulated) muscle the actin-myosin binding site is blocked by tropomyosin.2) So myofilaments can't slide past each other because the myosin heads can't bind to the actin-myosin binding site on the actin filaments.myosinglobularhead\ntropomyosin blocks the\" binding siteMuscle Contraction is Triggered by an Influx of Calcium IonsD2)When an action potential from a motor neurone stimulates a muscle cell, it depolarises the sarcolemma. Depolarisation spreads down the T-tubules to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (see p. 142). This causcs the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release stored calcium ions (Ca2+) into the sarcoplasm.3) Calcium ions bind to a protein attached toCa * binds to a protein, which moves tropomyosinmyosin head_ binds to the exposed siteactin-myosin cross bridge formedtropomyosin, causing the protein to change shape. This pulls the attached tropomyosin out of the actin-myosin binding site on the actin filament.4) This exposes the binding site, which allows the myosin head to bind.5) The bond formed when a myosin head binds to an actin filament is called an actin-myosin cross bridge.6)Calcium ions also activate the enzyme ATP hydrolase which hydrolyses (breaks down) ATP (into ADP + P;) to provide the energy needed for muscle contraction. ^ The energy released from ATP causes the myosin head to bend, which pulls the actin filament along in a kind of rowing action.Another ATP molecule provides the energy to break the actin-myosin cross bridge, so the myosin head detaches from the actin filament after it's moved.The myosin head then reattaches to a different binding site further along the actin filament. A new actin-myosin cross bridge is formed and the cycle is repeated (attach, move, detach, reattach to new binding site...)10) Many cross bridges form and break very rapidly, pulling the actin filament along \u2014 which shortens the sarcomere, causing the muscle to contract11) The cycle will continue as long as calcium ions are present.movement7)8)9)cross bridge breaksmyosin head reattaches to the next binding siteWhen Excitation Stops, Calcium Ions Leave1) When the muscle stops being stimulated, calcium ions leave their binding sites and are moved by active transport back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (this needs ATP too).2) This causes the tropomyosin molecules to move back, so they block the actin-myosin binding sites again.3) Muscles aren't contracted because no myosin heads are attached mm to actin filaments (so there are no actin-myosin cross bridges).4) The actin filaments slide back to their relaxed position, which lengthens the sarcomere.actin filaments slide backtropomyosin blocks the binding sites againTopic 6B \u2014 Nervous Coordination\n","18":"Most decisions have an ethical or moral dimension. \nFor\u00a0example:\n\u25a0 Should a toy company advertise its products to young \nchildren so that they pester their parents into buying \nthem?\n\u25a0 Is it acceptable to take bribes to place an order with another \ncompany?\n\u25a0 Should a bank invest in a company that manufactures \nweapons or tests new chemicals on animals?\n\u25a0 Is it acceptable to feed genetically modified food to cattle?\n\u25a0 Do we accept lower profits in the short term by purchasing \nless polluting production equipment?\n\u25a0 Should chief executives receive substantial pay rises and \nbonuses when other workers in the business are being \nmade redundant?\n\u25a0 Is it acceptable to close a factory to save costs and increase \nprofits even though many jobs will be lost and workers may \nfind it hard to get other jobs?\n\u25a0 If legal controls and inspections are weak in a country, is it \nacceptable to pay very low wages for long hours of work \u00a0\u2013 as \nthis policy will reduce the firm\u2019s costs?\n\u25a0 If a business can get away with it, should it employ child \nlabour to reduce costs compared to employing adults?

Biological molecules are often organic compounds. Organic compounds all contain carbon atoms. They also contain atoms of  hydrogen, oxygen and, less frequently, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus. Most of  the material in your body that is not water consists of  these organic molecules. An understanding of  why organic molecules are special will help you to understand the chemistry of  biological molecules including carbohydrates, lipids and proteins.\nEach carbon atom can make four bonds and so it can connect \nto four other atoms. Carbon atoms bond particularly strongly to other carbon atoms to make long chains. The four bonds of  a carbon atom usually form a tetrahedral shape. This means carbon compounds can be rings, branched chains or any number of  three-dimensional (3D) shapes (see fig A). In some carbon compounds small molecules (monomers) bond with many other similar units to make a very large molecule called a polymer. The ability of  carbon to combine and make macromolecules (large molecules) is the basis of  all biological molecules and provides the great variety and complexity found in living things.\nThese two bonds\nare in the plane\nof the paper.\nor more often as:C This bond goesback behind the\nplane of the paper.\nThis bond sticks out ofthe plane of the paper.\ncan be shown with corners representing carbons, and itshydrogens ignored:\nH\nCC\nHHCC\nHH\nHH\nHHC\nHC\nHHCC\nC\nHHC\nHHHH HH\nThis part \nof a chain molecule:\n\u25b2 fig A  T he bonds in a carbon atom have a complicated 3D shape.

They are also important for storing energy and they form an important part of  the cell wall in plants, fungi and bacteria. Sugars and starch are the best known carbohydrates. Sucrose is the familiar white crystalline table sugar; glucose is used as a fuel by the cells of  our bodies. Starch is in rice, flour and potatoes. But the group of  substances called carbohydrates contains many more compounds, as you will discover.\n\u25b2 fig B  Carbohydr ates are important molecules in both plants and animals \n\u2013 and carbohydrate foods like this bread play a major role in the human \ndiet.\nThe basic structure of  all carbohydrates is the same. They consist \nof  carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. There are three main groups of  carbohydrates: monosaccharides, disaccharides and \npolysaccharides. Some have more complex molecules than others (see Section 1A.3).\nMONOSACCHARIDES: THE SIMPLE SUGARS \nMonosaccharides are simple sugars in which there is one oxygen \natom and two hydrogen atoms for each carbon atom in the molecule. A general formula for this can be written (CH\n2O)n. Here \nn can be any number, but it is usually low.\nTriose sugars (n = 3) have three carbon atoms and the general \nformula C3H6O3.

Much of this book is concerned with \nhow these decisions are made, the information needed to \nmake them and the techniques that can assist managers in \nthis important task. However, no student of Business can \nhope to make much progress in the study of this subject \nunless they have a good understanding of the economic \nenvironment in which a business operates. Business activity \ndoes not take place in isolation from what is going on \naround it. Th e very structure and health of the economy \nwill have a great impact on how successful business activity \nis. Th e central purpose of this whole unit, \u2018Business and \nits environment\u2019, is to introduce the inter-relationships \nbetween businesses, the world in which they operate and the \nlimits that governments impose on business activity. Th i s  \nfi rst chapter explains the nature of business activity and the \nrole of enterprise in setting up and developing businesses.\nThe purpose of business activity\nA business is any organisation that uses resources to \nmeet the needs of customers by providing a product or \nservice that they demand. Th ere are several stages in the \nproduction of fi nished goods. Business activity at all stages \ninvolves creating and adding value to resources, such \nas raw materials and semi- fi nished goods, and making \nthem more desirable to \u00a0\u2013 and thus valued by \u00a0\u2013 the fi nal \npurchaser. Without business activity, we would all still be \nentirely dependent on the goods that we could make or \ngrow ourselves \u00a0\u2013 as some people in virtually undiscovered \nnative communities still are. Business activity uses the \nscarce resources of our planet to produce goods and \nservices that allow us all to enjoy a very much higher \nstandard of living than would be possible if we remained \nentirely self-su ffi  cient.On completing this chapter, you will be able to:\n\u25a0 understand what business activity involves\n\u25a0 recognise that making choices as a result of the \n\u2018economic problem\u2019 always results in opportunity cost\n\u25a0 analyse the meaning and importance of creating value\n\u25a0 recognise the key characteristics of successful \nentrepreneurs\u25a0 assess the importance of enterprise and entrepreneurs \nto a country\u2019s economy\n\u25a0 understand the meaning of social enterprise and the \ndiff erence between this and other businesses.\n3","21":"1 Cell biology\n10Animal and plant cells\n\u25cf\u25cfGeneralised animal cells\nPlant and animal cells are eukaryotic. They can be unicellular or belong \nto multicellular organisms. Eukaryotic cells almost always have a \nnucleus and are generally larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells.\nThe structure of a generalised animal cell is shown in Figure 1.6. \nA generalised cell is one that has been simplified to make the key \ncomponents easier to identify.\n\u25b2 Figure 1.6 A generalised animal cell as seen with a microscope (magnified \u00d74800) \nand as three- and two-dimensional diagrams.\nComponents of animal cells\nIn the previous section we looked at bacterial cells. Animal cells have \nmany components in common with these. The cytoplasm of animal cells \nis also mainly water and it holds other components such as ribosomes. \nIn the cytoplasm most of the chemical reactions in the cell happen \n(such as the making of proteins in ribosomes).\nThe cell-surface membrane of animal cells also surrounds the cell. There \nare no cell walls in animal cells and so the membrane is on the outside \nof these cells. The membrane controls what substances go in and out of \nthe cell. Many cells need glucose and oxygen for respiration, and these \nsubstances move by diffusion into the cell from the blood, where it is \nfound at a higher concentration. Carbon dioxide moves back into the \nblood capillaries through the membrane.\nMitochondria are small organelles found in the cytoplasm and are \nonly present in eukaryotic cells. They are the site of most of a cell\u2019s \nrespiration. Here the energy stored in glucose is released for the cell \nto complete the seven life processes. Without this energy all cells die. \nMore-active cells such as those in muscles or sperm cells usually have \nmore mitochondria because these cells need more energy. Mitochondria \nhave many folds inside them, which make their surface area very large \nto increase the rate at which energy is released.\nRibosomes are the site of protein synthesis. These organelles are \npresent in the cytoplasm of animal cells.\nKEy TERM\nDiffusion  The net movement \nof particles from an area of high \nconcentration to an area of lower concentration.\nnucleuscell surface\nmembrane\ncytoplasmmitochondria\nribosomes\n","22":"1 Cell biology\n16\u25cf\u25cfCell differentiation\nThe previous two sections have looked at generalised and specialised \nanimal and plant cells. After generalised cells are formed they become \nspecialised as an organism develops. This process is called cell \ndifferentiation. Your cells did this while you were in your mother\u2019s \nuterus. Part of this process involves cells developing specific structures \nwithin them to allow them to function. For example, muscle cells need \nto release lots of energy during respiration and so require a high number \nof mitochondria. Unlike animal cells, most plant cells retain the ability \nto differentiate throughout their life. We would not be able to take plant \ncuttings without this. You will learn about this in Chapter 14.\nMicroscopy\nIt is not very easy to know who invented the first microscope or exactly when this happened. It is likely to have occurred in the 1590s in the \nNetherlands by makers of eye glasses. Seventy-five years later, in 1665, \nEnglish scientist Robert Hooke published a book called Micrographia, \nwhich was full of impressive images including a drawing of the eyes \nof a fly using a microscope. In this book he first used the word \u2018cell\u2019, \nbecause when he looked at plant cells using his microscope he was \nreminded of the cells in a honeycomb.\nA decade later, in the mid-1670s, a Dutch scientist called van \nLeeuwenhoek discovered sperm cells and then single-celled bacteria \nfrom a human mouth.

You need to know the structure of the lungs as well as how they're ventilated... take a deep breath...Lungs are Specialised Organs for Gas ExchangeHumans need to get oxygen into the blood (for respiration) and they need to get rid of carbon dioxide (made by respiring cells). This is where breathing (or ventilation as it's sometimes called) and the gas exchange system comes in.Human Gas Exchange Systemintercostal muscles bronchusbronchiole alveoli1) As you breathe in, air enters the trachea (windpipe).2) The trachea splits into two bronchi \u2014 one bronchus leading to each lung.3) Each bronchus then branches off into smaller tubes called bronchioles.4) The bronchioles end in small 'air sacs' called alveoli (this is where gases are exchanged \u2014 see next page).5) The ribcage, intercostal muscles and diaphragm all work together to move air in and out (see below).si 111 n 111 u i w 111 m i \\ \/111 u ii i u 111111111 11111 m i 11 w n 111111\/ ~ There are actually three layers of intercostal muscles.

To do this, you need to evaluate the data used to support the claim and the methodology behind it.New Knowledge About Vaccines and Antibodies is Validated by ScientistsWhen a study presents evidence for a new theory (e.g. a vaccine has a dangerous side effect) it's important that other scientists come up with more evidence to validate (confirm) the theory. Other scientists may repeat the study and try to reproduce the results, or conduct other studies to try to prove the same theory.EXAMPLE 1: The MMR Vaccine1) In 1998, a study was published about the safety of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.The study was based on 12 children with autism (a life-long developmental disability) and concluded that there may be a link between the MMR vaccine and autism.2) Not everyone was convinced by this study because it had a very small sample size of 12 children, which increased the likelihood of the results being due to chance. The study may have been biased because one of the scientists was helping to gain evidence for a lawsuit against the MMR vaccine manufacturer. Also, studies carried out by different scientists found no link between autism and the MMR vaccine.3) There have been further scientific studies to sort out the conflicting evidence. In 2005, a Japanese study was published about the incidence of autism in Yokohama (an area of Japan). They looked at the medical records of 30 000 children born between 1988 and 1996 and counted the number of children that developed autism before the age of seven. The MMR jab was first introduced in Japan in 1989 andwas stopped in 1993. During this time the MMR vaccine was administered to children at 12 months old. The graph shows the results of the study.4) In the exam you could be asked to evaluate evidence like this.\u2022 You might be asked to describe the data...The graph shows that the number of children diagnosed with autism continued to rise after the MMR vaccine was stopped. For example, from all the children born in 1992, who did receive the MMR jab, about 60 out of 10 000 were diagnosed with autism before the age of seven. However, from all the children born in 1994, who did not receive the MMR jab, about 160 out of 10 000 of them were diagnosed with autism before the age of seven.\u2022 ...or draw conclusions There is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\u2022 ... or evaluate the methodology You can be much more confident in this study, compared to the 1998 study, because the sample size was so large \u2014 30 000 children were studied. A larger sample size means that the results are less likely to be due to chance.EXAMPLE 2: Herceptin\u00ae\u2014 Monoclonal AntibodiesAbout 20% of women with breast cancer have tumours that produce more than the usual amount of a receptor called HER2. Herceptin1 is a drug used to treat this type of breast cancer \u2014 it contains monoclonal antibodies that bind the HER2 receptor on a tumour cell and prevent the cells from growing and dividing.In 2005, a study tested Herceptin\u00ae on women who had already undergone chemotherapy for HER2-type breast cancer. 1694 women took the drug for a year after chemotherapy and another 1694 women were observed for the same time (the control group). The results are shown in the graph on the right.Describe the data: Almost twice as many women in the control groupdeveloped breast cancer again or died compared to the group taking Herceptin\u00ae.Draw conclusions: A one-year treatment with Herceptin\u00ae, after chemotherapy, increases the disease-free survival rate for women with HER2-type breast cancer.250\nHerceptin* * Control Group of womenYear of birth 19-I ' 1 \/ I I I \/ II I u I I ( I l \\ l I | l I I\/\/ \u00a3 Have a look at pages 213-214 r for more about drawing : conclusions and evaluating. :''i 1111111 n 1111 n 11 \/i \\ 11111 \\\\N\nTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","25":"757InheritanceA Punnett square is just another way of showing a genetic diagram \u2014 they're also used to predict the genotypes and phenotypes of offspring.

This is made up of  a series of  vessels with the heart as a pump to move blood through the vessels. The blood is the transport medium and its passage through the vessels is called the circulation. The system delivers the materials needed by the cells of  the body, and carries away the waste products of  their metabolism. Substances move between the plasma or red blood cells and the body cells by diffusion or by active transport (see Section 2A.4). The tiniest blood vessels have walls only one cell thick, so diffusion distances are short and substances pass easily across these into other cells. Every cell in the body is near one of  these small vessels. The blood also carries out other functions, such as carrying hormones (chemical messages) from one part of  the body to another, forming part of  the defence system of  the body and distributing heat.\nTHE COMPONENTS OF THE BLOOD AND THEIR \nMAIN FUNCTIONS\nY ou are going to study all three parts of  the cardiovascular \nsystem, starting with the transport medium \u2013 the blood. Y our blood is a complex mixture carrying a wide variety of  cells and substances to all areas of  your body (see fig A).\nred blood\ncellplateletplasma\nwhitebloodcell\n\u25b2 fig A  T his light micrograph shows red blood cells, white blood cells  \nand platelets.LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n \u25fcUnder stand the role of haemoglobin in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide.\n \u25fcUnder\nstand the oxygen dissociation curve of haemoglobin, the Bohr effect and the significance of the oxygen affinity \nof fetal haemoglobin compared with adult haemoglobin.\n \u25fcUnder\nstand the blood clotting process.\nPLASMA\nY our blood plasma is the fluid part of  your mass transport system. \nOver 50% of  your blood volume is plasma, and it carries all of  your blood cells and everything else that needs transporting around your body. This includes:\n \u2022dig\nested food products (e.g. glucose and amino acids) from the \nsmall intestine to the liver and then to all the parts of  the body where they are needed either for immediate use or storage\n \u2022nutrient molecules fr\nom storage areas to the cells that need \nthem\n \u2022e\nxcretory products (e.g. carbon dioxide and urea) from cells to \nthe organs such as the lungs or kidneys that excrete them from the body\n \u2022chemical messa\nges (hormones) from where they are made to \nwhere they cause changes in the body.\nThe plasma helps to maintain a steady body temperature by transferring heat around the system from internal organs (e.g. the gut) or very active tissues (e.g. leg muscles in someone running) to the skin, where it can be lost to the surroundings. It also acts as a buffer to regulate pH changes.\nERYTHROCYTES (RED BLOOD CELLS)\nThere are approximately 5 million erythrocytes per mm3 of  blood \n(4\u20135 million per mm3 in women, 5\u20136\u00a0million per mm3 in men). \nThey contain haemoglobin, a red pigment that carries oxygen and gives them their colour (see Section 1A.5). They are made in the bone marrow. Mature erythrocytes do not contain a nucleus and have a limited life of  about 120 days.\nThe erythrocytes transport oxygen from the lungs to all the cells. \nThey are well adapted for their function. The biconcave disc shape of  the cells means that they have a large surface area to volume ratio, so oxygen can diffuse into and out of  them rapidly (see fig B). Having no nucleus leaves much more space inside the cells for the haemoglobin molecules that carry the oxygen. In fact, each red blood cell contains around 250\u2013300\u00a0million molecules of  haemoglobin and can carry approximately 1000\u00a0million molecules of  oxygen. Haemoglobin also carries some of  the carbon dioxide produced in respiration back to the lungs. The rest is transported in the plasma.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Ahh...ATP is the Immediate Source of Energy in a Cell1) Plant and animal cells release energy from glucose \u2014 this process is called respiration.2) A cell can't get its energy directly from glucose.3) So, in respiration, the energy released from glucose is used to make ATP (adenosine triphosphate).4) ATP is made from the nucleotide base adenine, combined with a ribose sugar and three phosphate groups. It's what's known as a nucleotide derivative because it's a modified form of a nucleotide:\n5) Once made, ATP diffuses to the part of the cell that needs energy.6) The energy in ATP is stored in high energy bonds between the phosphate groups. It's released via hydrolysis reactions (see below).ATP is Quickly Made and Used1) When energy is needed by a cell, ATP is broken down into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and P; (inorganic phosphate).2) This is a hydrolysis reaction. A phosphate bond is broken and energy is released.The reaction is catalysed by the enzyme ATP hydrolase.3) ATP hydrolysis can be 'coupled' to other energy-requiring reactions in the cell \u2014 this means the energy released can be used directly to make the coupled reaction happen, rather than being lost as heat.4) The released inorganic phosphate can also be put to use \u2014 it can be added to another compound (this is known as phosphorylation), which often makes the compound more reactive.5) ATP can be re-synthesised in a condensation reaction between ADP and Pr This happens during both respiration and photosynthesis, and is catalysed by the enzyme ATP synthase.________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\u00a9\"'11111 \/1, iADP + P;adenosine diphosphate i.e. it has 2 phosphatesPhosphate groupsCONDENSATION(ENERGY USED)ATP--ATP synthaseadenosine triphosphate i.e. it has 3 phosphatesPhosphate groups\u00a9O\u00a91inorganicphosphateHYDROLYSIS (ENERGY RELEASED)\u00a9' 1 1 1 I 1 I I M 1 I I I I II \\,y- Inorganic phosphate 'r (P) is just the- fancy name for a r- single phosphate. ^\/ 1 1 I I I M I I I I I I | | I ITopic 1B \u2014 More Biological Molecules\n''Hi i n'-\n","28":"33 1B.2 THE ROLES OF THE BLOOD MAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS\nIn the lungs, the carbon dioxide concentration is low, so carbonic anhydrase catalyses the reverse \nreaction and free carbon dioxide diffuses out of  the blood and into the lungs (see fig D).\nCarbon dioxide passes into the plasma and re d\nblood cells by diffusion.

When the proportion of  carbon dioxide in the tissues is high, the affinity of  haemoglobin for oxygen is reduced. In other words, haemoglobin needs higher levels of  oxygen to become saturated and releases oxygen much more easily. So in active tissues with high carbon dioxide levels, haemoglobin releases oxygen more readily. Carbon dioxide levels in the lung capillaries are relatively low, which makes it easier for oxygen to bind to the haemoglobin. The changes in the oxygen dissociation curve that result as the carbon dioxide level changes are known as the Bohr effect. \nSaturation with oxygen\/%\n0\n0 2 4 6\nPartial pressure of oxygen\/kPaA 5 2.7  kPa  CO2\nB 5 6.7  kPa  CO2\nC 5 10.6  kPa  CO2\n8 10 12102030405060708090100\nA\nB\nC\n\u25b2 fig E  As the pr oportion of carbon dioxide in the environment rises, the haemoglobin curve moves down and to \nthe right, so it gives up oxygen more easily. This is known as the Bohr effect.\nFETAL HAEMOGLOBIN\nA fetus in the uterus depends on its mother to supply it with oxygen. Oxygenated blood from the mother flows through the placenta close to the deoxygenated fetal blood. If  the blood of  the fetus had the same affinity for oxygen as the blood of  the mother, very little oxygen would be transferred. Fortunately, the blood of  the fetus contains a special form of  the oxygen-carrying pigment called fetal haemoglobin. Fetal haemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than the adult haemoglobin of  the mother. Consequently, the fetal haemoglobin can remove oxygen from the maternal blood even when the proportion of  oxygen is relatively low (see fig F). The maternal and fetal blood also run in LEARNING TIP\nRemember that as CO2 builds \nup it affects the pH and this has \nan effect on the protein structure, so haemoglobin does not work as well (i.e. it has a lower affinity for oxygen).\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

At least there's some extra new stuff to get your teeth stuck into...Variation Can be Caused by Genes, the Environment, or Both1)2)3)4)5)6)Variation is the differences that exist between individuals. Variation within a species means that individuals in a populationx\\' ' 1 i i i r h i i i i i i i | , ,- Variation within a C r species is also called 5- intraspecific variation -can show a wide range of different phenotypes.Although individuals of the same species have the same genes, they have different alleles (versions of genes) \u2014 this causes genetic variation within a species.The main source of this genetic variation is mutation, e.g. when changes in the DNA base sequence lead to the production of new alleles \u2014 see page 180. But genetic variation is also introduced during meiosis (through the crossing over of chromatids and the independent segregation of chromosomes) and because of the random fertilisation of gametes during sexual reproduction.Variation within a species can also be caused by differences in the environment, e.g. climate, food, lifestyle.Most variation within a species is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.But only genetic variation results in evolution.Evolution is a Change in Allele Frequencies Over TimeThe frequency of an allele in a population changes over time \u2014 this is evolution.Natural selection is one method by which evolution occurs.

Individuals with a phenotype that increases their chance of survival are more likely to survive, reproduce and pass on their genes (including the beneficial alleles that determine their phenotype), than individuals with a different phenotype.This means that a greater proportion of the next generation inherit the beneficial alleles. They, in turn, are more likely to survive, reproduce and pass on their genes.So the frequency of the beneficial alleles in the gene pool increases from generation to generation.\"i\"i n11! m i\/\/,- A selection pressure -r is anything that r- affects an organisms -- chance of survival Z- and reproduction -'<111 n \" 11 n n 1111Different Types of Natural Selection Lead to Different Frequency PatternsStabilising selection and directional selection are types of natural selection that affect allele frequency in different ways. You'll have covered these in Topic 4, but now there's an extra one to learn about \u2014 disruptive selection.STABILISING SELECTION is where individuals with alleles for characteristics towards the middle of the range are more likely to survive and reproduce. It occurs when the environment isn't changing, and it reduces the range of possible phenotypes.Example: In any mammal population there's a range of fur length. In a stable climate, having fur at the extremes of this range reduces the chances of surviving as it's harder to maintain the right body temperature. Animals with alleles for average fur length are the most likely to survive, reproduce and pass on their alleles. So these alleles increase in frequency. The proportion of the population with average fur length increases and the range of fur lengths decreases.PARENTStotal populationbreedingpopulationfur lengthTopic 7B \u2014 Populations and Evolution\n","30":"722Farming Practices and ProductionFarmers know the theory behind energy transfers and try to use it to maximise production\u2014 smart thinking.

Each of the stages in a food chain is called a trophic level.3) Food webs show lots of food chainsin an ecosystem and how they overlap4) Decomposers (e.g. fungi) are also part of food webs.

There are different ways this can be done. You need to know about two of them.1) The energy lost to other organisms, e.g. pests, can be reduced.2) The energy lost through respiration can be reduced.(T) Simplifying Food Webs Reduces Energy Loss to Other OrganismsHere's an example of a simplified food web involving a crop plant grown for human consumptionThe weed, the mouse and the aphid are pests \u2014 organisms that reduce the amount of energy available for crop growth and therefore the net primary production (NPP). This ultimately reduces the amount of energy available for humans.By simplifying the food web, i.e. getting rid of food chains that don't involve humans, energy losses will be reduced and the NPP of the crop will increase.weed\u2014\u0000aphid\u2014\u0000ladybirds*wheat \u2014\u0000 mouse \u2014\u0000hawkSimplifying the food web means getting rid of pests \u2014 and for that, farmers need pest control.1) Farmers can reduce pest numbers using chemical pesticides. For example:\u2022 Insecticides kill insect pests that eat and damage crops. Killing insect pests means less biomass is lost from crops, so they grow to be larger, which means NPP is greater.\u2022 Herbicides kill weeds (unwanted plant species). Killing weeds can remove direct competition with the crop for energy from the Sun. It can also remove the preferred habitat or food source of the insect pests, helping to further reduce their numbers and simplify the food web.2) Biological agents also reduce the numbers of pests, so crops lose less energy and biomass, increasing the efficiency of energy transfer to humans.\u2022 Parasites live in or lay their eggs on a pest insect. Parasites either kill the insect or reduce its ability to function, e.g. some wasp species lay their eggs inside caterpillars \u2014 the eggs hatch and kill the caterpillars.\u2022 Pathogenic (disease-causing) bacteria and viruses are used to kill pests,O'\"\" M,m ii win mm iin\/n\/,, r Natural predators can also be r- introduced to the ecosystem to eat *- r the pest species, e.g. ladybirds eat ~- aphids this is useful but doesn't \u2014- really simplify the food web H\/( 1 1 1 1 I I M II II II (I I | I 1 | | | | , ,, ;e.g. the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produces a toxin that kills a wide range of caterpillars.3) Farmers can use integrated systems that combine both chemical and biological methods.The combined effect of using both can reduce pest numbers even more than either method alone, meaning NPP is increased even more.Topic 5B \u2014 Energy Transfer and Nutrient Cycles\n","31":"2Topic IA \u2014 Biological MoleculesCarbohydratesEven though there is, and has been, a huge variety of different organisms on Earth, they all share some biochemistry\u2014 for example, they all contain a few carbon-based compounds that interact in similar ways.Most Carbohydrates are Polymers1) Most carbohydrates (as well as proteins and nucleic acids) are polymers.2) Polymers are large, complex molecules composed of long chains of '=4monomers joined together.3) Monomers are small, basic molecular units.4) Examples of monomers include monosaccharides, amino acids and nucleotides.monomer e.g. monosaccharide, amino acidhrpolymer e.g. carbohydrate, proteinCarbohydrates are Made from Monosaccharides1) All carbohydrates contain the elements C, H and O.2) The monomers that they're made from are monosaccharides, e.g. glucose, fructose and galactose.1) Glucose is a hexose sugar \u2014 a monosaccharide with six carbon atoms in each molecule.2) There are two types of glucose, alpha (a) and beta (|3)\u2014 they're isomers (molecules with the same molecular formula as each other, but with the atoms connected in a different way).3) You need to know the structures of both types of glucose for your exam\u2014 it's pretty easy because there's only one difference between the two:a-glucose moleculeP-glucose moleculeCH,OH i 2H\\\/ h  \\  r \\Hn\/  \\ ?

Th ese are \ncalled the private costs of production. We are all aware, \nhowever, of the consequences of production other than \nthose from the use of these factors. Air pollution, noise \npollution and the dumping of waste products are all side \neff ects of most manufacturing processes. Who pays the \ncosts of cleaning up a ft er the production of chemicals \nor plastics, for example? Unless the business is forced \nto pay, the costs will be borne by the rest of society; the \ngovernment or local authority will have to raise taxes \nto clean the buildings dirtied by smoke, pay for medical \nprovision for those a ff ected by air pollution and make \nprovision for waste disposal.\nExternal costs: costs of an economic activity that are not \npaid for by the producer or consumer, but by the rest of \nsociety.\nKEY TERM\nIn this example, the market has failed to re fl ect the true \nand total cost of production in the price of the product. If \nthe price charged to consumers included all of the costs of \nproduction \u00a0\u2013 private as well as external \u00a0\u2013 then less would \nbe demanded and produced. As the price charged does \nnot include the external costs, too much of the product \nwill be demanded and too much produced. Th ere has been \nmarket \u00a0failure.\nMarket failure 2: Labour training\nWill fi rms pay for the training of sta ff  when there is a \nreal danger that, once quali fi ed, they could be \u2018poached\u2019 \nby other businesses that have not paid for the training? \nTh e answer is that many fi rms will not make su ffi  cient \nprovision for training. Th is means that the country has a \nshortage of skilled workers and professional sta ff , which \nwill reduce economic growth. In this case there is \nunder-provision of training and this again is a form of \nmarket failure.\nMarket failure 3: Monopoly producers\nWhen a market is dominated by one fi rm, a monopoly is \nsaid to exist. Th e business will be interested in making \nprofi ts as high as possible. Th e easiest way of achieving \nthis will be to restrict output and raise prices. As the \nmonopolist is able to prevent competitors from \u00a0entering \nthe market, this strategy will lead to under-provision of goods and services compared with what consumers \nwould really like. Th is is, therefore, a form of \nmarket \u00a0failure.\nCorrecting or controlling market failure\nTable 9.7 takes the three examples of market failure we \nhave considered a nd looks at the groups most a ff ected and \nthe corrective action that could be taken.\nIncome elasticity of demand\nVirtually all businesses will have greater opportunities \nfor increased sales, pro fi ts and expansion during periods \nof economic growth. Th e impact of growth and the rising \nconsumer incomes that accompany it will not be evenly \nfelt, however. Some businesses will experience substantial \nincreases in the demand for their goods and services, while \nothers will notice a more limited rise \u00a0\u2013 and, in certain \ncases, demand may actually fall for particular product \ncategories. Th is varied experience resulting from economic \ngrowth is most clearly analysed by considering the concept \nof income elasticity of demand . Elasticity measures the \nresponsiveness of the demand for a product following \na change in a variable. Th ere are several measures of \nelasticity and others are explained in Chapter 18.\nIncome elasticity of demand: measures the \nresponsiveness of demand for a product a ft er a change in \nconsumer incomes.\nKEY TERM\nIncome elasticity of demand is calculated by the following \nformula:\nIncome elasticity of demand =\n% change in demand for a product\n% change in consumer incomees\nIncome elasticity can be described for three classes of \ngoods.\n1 Normal goods: The income elasticity for normal goods \nis positive and between 0 and 1. This means that, when \nconsumer incomes rise, the demand for these goods may \nwell also increase, but by a smaller proportion. These tend \nto be essential or necessity goods, which will be bought in \nroughly the same quantities by consumers no matter what \ntheir incomes. Examples might include basic foods and \npharmaceutical goods. Producers of normal goods will not \nexperience sharp increases in demand when incomes are \nrising during economic growth, but neither will the demand \nfor them fall greatly when consumer incomes decline.1179: External economic influences on business behaviour ","37":"4CarbohydratesSo, you've already looked at monosaccharides and disaccharides... now it's time to give polysaccharides some love.Polysaccharides are Loads of Sugars Joined TogetherA polysaccharide is formed when more than two monosaccharides are joined together by condensation reactions.\na-glucose a-glucose a-glucose a-glucose a-glucoseYou need to know about the relationship between the structure and function of three polysaccharides\u2014 starch, glycogen and cellulose.Starch is the Main Energy Storage Material in Plants\none alpha-glucose molecule1) Cells get energy from glucose. Plants store excess glucose as starch (when a plant needs more glucose for energy, it breaks down starch to release the glucose).2) Starch is a mixture of two polysaccharides of alpha-glucose \u2014 amylose and amylopectin:\u2022 Amylose \u2014 a long, unbranched chain of a-glucose. The angles of the glycosidic bonds give it a coiled structure, almost like a cylinder. This makes it compact, so it's really good for storage because you can fit more in to a small space.\u2022 Amylopectin \u2014 a long, branched chain of a-glucose. Its side branches allow the enzymes that break down the molecule to get at the glycosidic bonds easily.This means that the glucose can be released quickly. Amylopectin3) Starch is insoluble in water and doesn't affect water potential (see page 40), so it doesn't cause water to enter cells by osmosis, which would make them swell.This makes it good for storage.Use the Iodine Test for StarchIf you do any experiment on the digestion of starch and want to find out if any is left, you'll need the iodine test.just add iodine dissolved in potassium iodide solution to the test sample. If there is starch present, the sample changes from browny-orange to a dark, blue-black colour.Glycogen is the Main Energy Storage Material in AnimalsGlycogen1) Animal cells get energy from glucose too.But animals store excess glucose as glycogen\u2014 another polysaccharide of alpha-glucose.2) Its structure is very similar to amylopectin, except that it has loads more side branches coming off it. Loads of branches means that stored glucose can be released quickly, which is important for energy release in animals.3) It's also a very compact molecule, so it's good for storage.After throwing and fetching the ball no less than 312 times, Chappy and Stuart were finally out of glycogen.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","38":"28Prokaryotic Cells and VirusesNow we're on to prokaryotic cells and viruses.

It's made of a polymer called murein. Murein is a glycoprotein (a protein with a carbohydrate attached).Some prokaryotes, e.g. bacteria, also have a capsule made up of secreted slime. It helps to protect bacteria from attack by cells of the immune system.The cytoplasm of a prokaryotic cell has no membrane-bound organelles (unlike a eukaryotic cell). It has ribosomes \u2014 but they're smaller than those in a eukaryotic cell.\nPlasmids are small loops of DNAthat aren't part of the main circular DNA molecule. Plasmids contain genes for things like antibiotic resistance, and can be passed between prokaryotes. Plasmids are not always present in prokaryotic cells. Some prokaryotic cells have several.Unlike a eukaryotic cell, a prokaryotic cell doesn't have a nucleus. Instead, the DNA floats free in the cytoplasm. It's circular DNA, present as one long coiled-up strand.It's not attached to any histone proteins (see p. 82).The flagellum (plural flagella) is a long, hair-like structure that rotates to make the prokaryotic cell move. Not all prokaryotes have a flagellum. Some have more than one.Just like in a eukaryotic cell, the plasma membrane is mainly made of lipids and proteins. It controls the movement of substances into and out of the cell.\nTheo went the wrong way about getting practical experience in understanding cell structure.Viruses are Acellular\u2014 They\u2019re Not CellsViruses are just nucleic acids surrounded by protein \u2014 they're not even alive.\u2022 They're even smaller than bacteria \u2014 e.g. HIV is about 0.1 pm across.\u2022 Unlike bacteria, viruses have no plasma membrane, no cytoplasm and no ribosomes.\u2022 All viruses invade and reproduce inside the cells of other organisms.These cells are known as host cells.Viruses contain a core \u00ab e The protein coat aroundof genetic material 1 core is called the capsid.either DNA or RNA.Fi 1C.

Yeah right.Plants Photosynthesise and Produce Biomass1) An ecosystem includes all the organisms living in a particular area and all the non-living (abiotic) conditions (see p. 170).2) In all ecosystems, there are producers \u2014 organisms that make their own food, e.g. plants and algae produce their own food through photosynthesis.3) During photosynthesis plants use energy (from sunlight) and carbon dioxide (from the atmosphere in land-based ecosystems, or dissolved in water in aquatic ecosystems) to make glucose and other sugars (see pages 106-109).4) Some of the sugars produced during photosynthesis are used in respiration, to release energy for growth.5) The rest of the glucose is used to make other biological molecules, such as cellulose (a component of plant cell walls). These biological molecules make up the plant's biomass \u2014 the mass of living material.6) Biomass can also be thought of as the chemical energy stored in the plant.7) Energy is transferred through the living organisms of an ecosystem when organisms eat other organisms, e.g. producers are eaten by organisms called primary consumers. Primary consumers are then eaten by secondary consumers and secondary consumers are eaten by tertiary consumers. This is a food chain (see p. 122).Biomass can be Measured as Dry Mass or Using a CalorimeterBiomass can be measured in terms of the mass of carbon that an organism The water content of'livin' 'tissue' v' W''' contains or the dry mass of its tissue per unit area. \u00a3 so cry mass is used as a melsu^oT z1) Dry mass is the mass of the organism with the water removed. ''n\\ i imTm mnl um'm mm2) To measure the dry mass, a sample of the organism is dried, often in an oven set to a low temperature.The sample is then weighed at regular intervals (e.g. every day). Once the mass becomes constant you know that all the water has been removed.3) If needed, the result from the sample can be scaled up to give the dry mass (biomass) of the totalpopulation or the area being investigated. A typical unit for dry mass might be kg nr2.4) The mass of carbon present is generally taken to be 50% of the dry mass.You can estimate the amount of chemical energy stored in biomass by burning the biomass in a calorimeter.The amount of heat given off tells you how much energy is in it. Energy is measured in joules (J) or kilojoules (kj).1) A sample of dry biomass is burnt and the energy released is used to heat a known volume of water.2) The change in temperature of the water is used to calculate the chemical energy of the dry biomass.GPP and NPP are Chemical Energy Stores~ Remember plants convert -1) Gross primary production (GPP) is the total amount of chemical energy r \"9ht energy to chemical -converted from light energy by plants, in a given area. dunn9 Photosynthesis -( 1 I 1 1 \/ N | \/ \/ \/ | , | . ,2) Approximately 50% of the gross primary production is lost to the environment as heat when the plants respire. This is called respiratory loss (R).3) The remaining chemical energy is called the net primary production (NPP). So NPP = GPP - R.4) The NPP is the energy available to the plant for growth and reproduction \u2014 the energy is stored in the plant'sbiomass. It is also the energy available to organisms at the next stage in the food chain (the next trophic level, see page 122). These include herbivores (animals that eat the plants) and decomposers.5) Often primary production is expressed as a rate \u2014 i.e. the total amount of chemical energy (or biomass) in agiven area, in a given time. Typical units might be kj ha 1 year1 (kilojoules per hectare per year) or kj nr2 yr1.When primary production is expressed as a rate, it is called primary productivity.r ^net primary production = gross primary production - respiratory loss\\- VEXAMPLE: The grass in an ecosystem has a gross primary productivity of 20 000 k) m 2 yr~1.

Mitosis and meiosis have different outcomes:Outcomes:MitosisProduces cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell.Daughter cells are genetically identical to each other and to the parent cell.Produces two daughter cells.MeiosisProduces cells with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.Daughter cells are genetically different from one another and the parent cell.Produces four daughter cells.You need to be able to explain the different outcomes of mitosis and meiosis. They're different because mitosis only involves one division (which separates the sister chromatids) whereas meiosis has two divisions (which separate the homologous pairs and then the sister chromatids). There's no pairing or separating of homologous chromosomes in mitosis, and so no crossing over or independent segregation of chromosomes. This produces genetically identical daughter cells \u2014 unlike meiosis.Topic 4B \u2014 Diversity, Classification and Variation\n","41":"80Transport in Plants \u2014 PhloemNext up, it's time to look at phloem. I know,; I almost can't contain my excitement. When it comes to the phloem it's all about moving dissolved organic substances around the plant, so it's a bit different to xylem.Phloem Tissue is Adapted for Transporting Solutes1) Solutes are dissolved substances. Phloem tissue transports solutes (mainly sugars like sucrose) round plants. Like xylem, phloem is formed from cells arranged in tubes.2) Sieve tube elements and companion cells are important cell types in phloem tissue:\u2022 Sieve tube elements are living cells that form the tube for transporting solutes. They have no nucleus and few organelles, so...\u2022 ...there's a companion cell for each sieve tube element. They carry out living functions for sieve cells, e.g. providing the energy needed for the active transport of solutes.Translocation is the Movement of Solutes1) Translocation is the movement of solutes (e.g. sugars like sucrose, and amino acids) to where they're needed in a plant. Solutes are sometimes called assimilates.2) It's an energy-requiring process that happens in the phloem.3) Translocation moves solutes from 'sources' to 'sinks'. The source of a solute is where it's made (so it's at a high concentration there). The sink is the area where it's used up (so it's at a lower concentration there).E.g. the source for sucrose is usually the leaves (where it's made), and the sinks are the other parts of the plant, especially the food storage organs and the meristems {areas of growth) in the roots, stems and leaves.4) Enzymes maintain a concentration gradient from the source to the sink by changing the solutes at the sink (e.g. by breaking them down or making them into something else). This makes sure there's always a lower concentration at the sink than at the source.E.g. in potatoes, sucrose is converted to starch in the sink areas, so there's always a lower concentration of sucrose at the sink than inside the phloem. This makes sure a constant supply of new sucrose reaches the sink from the phloem.The Mass Flow Hypothesis Best Explains Phloem TransportScientists still aren't certain exactly how the solutes are transported from source to sink by translocation. The best supported theory is the mass flow hypothesis:1) Active transport (see p. 42) is used to actively load the solutes (e.g. sucrose from photosynthesis) from companion cells into the sieve tubes of the phloem at the source (e.g. the leaves).2) This lowers the water potential inside the sieve tubes, so water enters the tubes by osmosis from the xylem and companion cells.3) This creates a high pressure inside the sieve tubes at the source end of the phloem.1) At the sink end, solutes are removed from the phloem to be used up.2) This increases the water potential inside the sieve tubes, so water also leaves the tubes by osmosis.3) This lowers the pressure inside the sieve tubes.(j) SOURCElow water potential, high pressurewater flow solute flow\u00a9sieve plate plasmodesma\u2014Water flows to xylem(2) SINK high water potential,\u00ae1) The result is a pressure gradient from the source end to the sink end.

These also lower your risk of  developing atherosclerosis and CVDs. A study of  10\n 269 male Har\nvard University (USA) graduates aged between \n45 and 84 showed that the men who changed from being inactive to taking regular exercise had a 23% lower mortality over the life of  the study than those who did not exercise. Moreover, the main cause of  the deaths was atherosclerosis and the linked CVDs. A study of  72\n 488 f\nemale nurses \nshowed the same benefits for women \u2013 the more active women had a significantly lower risk of  developing atherosclerosis and other CVDs. \nA 2013 study from Sri Lanka showed a similar pattern \u2013 high levels of  inactivity were linked to an \nincreased risk of  obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and CVDs. High levels of  activity were linked to a reduced risk of  all these conditions. Several studies have shown that exercise both reduces the formation of  plaques in the arteries and also keeps plaques that are present more stable and less likely to break.\nHIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nAs you saw in Section 1B.4, the heart pumps blood out into your arteries in a regular rhythm. The blood travels through your arterial system at pressures which change as your heart beats and which are easily measured (see fig C). At systole, when the blood is forced out of  the heart, a healthy blood pressure is around 120\n mmHg\n. When the heart is relaxed and filling during diastole, a healthy blood \npressure is around 80\n mmHg\n. Measuring blood pressure is used as an indicator of  the health of  both \nyour heart and your blood vessels. Y our blood pressure goes up and down naturally during the day \u2013 but it shouldn\u2019t be constantly raised. If  your blood pressure is regularly above 140\/90\n mmHg\n, you \nhave high blood pressure or hypertension. Raised blood pressure can be a sign of  atherosclerosis. The blood pressure goes up when the walls of  the arteries become less flexible due to the build-up of  plaque, and when the lumen of  the arteries get narrower as they are blocked by the plaques. This means that raised blood pressure can be the result of  atherosclerosis and can be used to help diagnose the disease.\n\u25b2 fig C  Doctors can use a blood pr essure monitor like this to check that your blood pressure is in the healthy range. \nSome people buy and use their own monitor, so they can check their blood pressure regularly to help prevent them \ngetting CVDs.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

This is called genetic engineering.2) Transformed microorganisms can be made using the same technology as in vivo cloning (see page 199). For example, foreign DNA can be inserted into microorganisms to produce lots of useful protein, e.g. insulin:jvM \/1 \" 1 I I \" , , , , , , , , I , 1 , # ( !

( I\\\n3)4)5)Transformed plants can also be produced. A gene that codes for a desirable protein is inserted into a plasmid. The plasmid is added to a bacterium and the bacterium is used as a vector to get the gene into the plant cells.If the right promoter region has been added along with the gene (see p. 199), the transformed cells will be able to produce the desired protein.Transformed animals can be produced too \u2014 a gene that codes for a desirable protein can be inserted into an early animal embryo or into the egg cells of a female. If the gene is inserted into a very early embryo, all the body cells of the resulting transformed animal will end up containing the gene. Inserting it into the egg cells means that when the female reproduces, all the cells of her offspring will contain the gene.Promoter regions that are only activated in specific cell types can be used to control exactly which of an animal's body cells the protein is produced in. If the protein is only produced in certain cells, it can be harvested more easily. Producing the protein in the wrong cells could also damage the organism.Recombinant DNA Technology Can be Used to Benefit HumansTransformed organisms (microorganisms, plants and animals) can be used in a variety of ways. You need to be able to interpret information about how they are used. Here are some examples:AgricultureAgricultural crops can be transformed so that they give higher yields or are more nutritious. This means these plants can be used to reduce the risk of famine and malnutrition. Crops can also be transformed to have pest resistance, so that fewer pesticides are needed. This reduces costs and reduces any environmental problems associated with using pesticides.For example, Golden Rice is a variety of transformed rice. It contains one gene from a maize plant and one gene from a soil bacterium, which together enable the rice to produce beta-carotene. The beta-carotene is used by our bodies to produce vitamin A. Golden Rice is being developed to reduce vitamin A deficiency in areas where there's a shortage of dietary vitamin A, e.g. south Asia, Africa. Vitamin A deficiency is a big problem in these areas, e.g. up to 500 000 children per year worldwide go blind due to vitamin A deficiency.IndustryIndustrial processes often use biological catalysts (enzymes). These enzymes can be produced from transformed organisms, so they can be produced in large quantities for less money, reducing costs.For example, chymosin (or rennin) is an enzyme used in cheese-making. It used to be made from rennet (a substance produced in the stomach of cows), but it can now be produced by transformed organisms. This means it can be made in large quantities, relatively cheaply and without killing any cows, making some cheese suitable for vegetarians.MedicineMany drugs and vaccines are produced by transformed organisms, using recombinant DNA technology. They can be made quickly, cheaply and in large quantities using this method.For example, insulin is used to treat Type 1 diabetes and used to come from animals (cow, horse or pig pancreases). This insulin wasn't human insulin though, so it didn't work quite as well. Human insulin is now made from transformed microorganisms, using a cloned human insulin gene (see above).Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n","44":"209Planning an ExperimentYou Need to Know How to Use Apparatus and Techniques CorrectlyExaminers could ask you about a whole range of different apparatus and techniques.

Don't forget that your solutions will need time to get to the same temperature as the water before you start the experiment too. Also, remember to check the temperature of the water bath with a thermometer during the investigation to make sure it doesn't change.\u2022 Data logger \u2014 Decide what you are measuring and what type of data logger you will need,e.g. temperature, pH. Connect an external sensor to the data logger if you need to. Decide how often you want the data logger to take readings depending on the length of the process that you are measuring.Make sure you know how to do all the practical investigations described in this book. You should be able to apply the techniques described to different contexts. For example, page 113 describes how to use a colorimeter and a redox indicator dye to investigate the rate of dehydrogenase activity in chloroplasts. You could use a similar technique (i.e. a colorimeter and a redox indicator dye) to investigate the rate of respiration in yeast.Risk Assessments Help You to Work Safely1) When you're planning an experiment, you need to carry out a risk assessment. To do this, you need to identify:\u2022 All the dangers in the experiment, e.g. any hazardous chemicals, microorganisms or naked flames.\u2022 Who is at risk from these dangers.\u2022 What can be done to reduce the risk, such as wearing goggles or gloves or working in a fume cupboard.2) You also need to consider any ethical issues in your experiment. For example, if you're using living animals (e.g. insects) you must treat them with respect. This means handling them carefully and keeping them away from harmful chemicals, extreme heat sources and other things that might cause them physical discomfort.Record Your Data in a Tableunits-It's a good idea to draw a table to record the results of your experiment in.1) When you draw a table, make sure you include enough rows and columns to record all of the data you need to.You might also need to include a column for processing your data (e.g. working out an average).2) Make sure each column has a heading so you know what's going to be recorded where. The units should be in the column heading, not the table itself.rowtheading, V  \u25a0Concentration \/ \u0000-* mol dm'3column0.20.40.6Absorbance \/ Absorbance Units (AU)0.50.91.3data3) The independent variable should be recorded in the left-hand column and the dependent variable in the right.Watch Out for Anomalous ResultsI U I I I H II I I I 1 I I I II III U I I I M I II I I I I I 1 M I I I I M I l-\u00a3.- Doing repeats makes it easier to spot anomalous results. -ti 1111111111 h 111 inn hi n n i in u 11 ii 1111 ii 11111\u201dWhen you look at all the data in your table, you may notice that you have a result that doesn't seem to fit in with the rest at all.

When you consider the movement of water, it's all about the xylem. It's pretty exciting stuff...Two Types of Tissue are Involved in Transport in Plants1) Xylem tissue transports water and mineral ions in solution.These substances move up the plant from the roots to the leaves.2) Phloem tissue transports organic substances like sugars (also in solution) bothup and down the plant \u2014 there's more about the phloem on pages 80-81.3) Xylem and phloem are mass transport systems (see page 54) \u2014 they move substances over large distances.Xylem vessels are the part of the xylem tissue that actually transports the water and ions. Xylem vessels are very long, tube-like structures formed from dead cells (vessel elements) joined end to end. There are no end walls on these cells, making an uninterrupted tube that allows water to pass up through the middle easily.Xvlem Vesselcell \u00a3wallno end wallc between cells\u00bbtube that water moves throughWater Moves Up a Plant Against the Force of GravityCohesion and tension help water move up plants, from roots to leaves, against the force of gravity.1) Water evaporates from the leaves at the 'top' of the xylem (this is transpiration \u2014 see below).2) This creates tension (suction), which pulls more water into the leaf.3) Water molecules are cohesive (they stick together \u2014 see page 21)so when some are pulled into the leaf others follow. 111 n n 11 u n \/\/,This means the whole column of water in the xylem, \u00a3 \u201d^'s is calle<^ -from the leaves down to the roots, moves upwards. - c\u00b0 esion'tensiori -\u2014 theory of water -4) Water enters the stem through the roots. ~ transport. -n i1 ii 111 niii\\sTranspiration is Loss of Water from a Plant\u2019s SurfaceTranspiration is the evaporation of water from a plant's surface, especially the leaves.1) Water evaporates from the moist cell walls and accumulates in the spaces between cells in the leaf.2) When the stomata open (see page 57), it moves out of the leaf down the concentration gradient (there's more water inside the leaf than in the air outside).s.\"'\"n\"\"i i n II I\/(I,,,,,r Transpiration's really a side \u00a3 r effect of photosynthesis \u2014 ~- the plant needs to open its \u00a7 r stomata to let in CO, so E ~ that it can produce glucose, -- but this also lets water out. z ' 111 11 \/1111111 \/ \/111 |, n\\sFour Main Factors Affect Transpiration Rate1) Light \u2014 the lighter it is the faster the transpiration rate (i.e. there's a positive correlationbetween light intensity and transpiration rate). This is because the stomata open when it gets light to let in CO, for photosynthesis. When it's dark the stomata are usually closed, so there's little transpiration.2) Temperature \u2014 the higher the temperature the faster the transpiration rate. Warmer water molecules have more energy so they evaporate from the cells inside the leaf faster. This increases the concentration gradient between the inside and outside of the leaf, making water diffuse out of the leaf faster.3) Humidity \u2014 the lower the humidity, the faster the transpiration rate (i.e. there's a negative correlationbetween humidity and transpiration rate). If the air around the plant is dry, the concentration gradient between the leaf and the air is increased, which increases transpiration.4) Wind \u2014 the windier it is, the faster the transpiration rate. Lots of air movement blows away water molecules from around the stomata.

Make it clear that both atria pump at the same time and both ventricles pump at the same time.\n1 T he inferior vena cava collects deoxygenated blood from the \nlower parts of  the body, while the superior vena cava receives \ndeoxygenated blood from the head, neck, arms and chest. Deoxygenated blood is delivered to the right atrium.\n2\n T\nhe right atrium receives the blood from the great veins. As it \nfills with blood, the pressure builds up and opens the tricuspid valve, so the right ventricle starts to fill with blood too. When the atrium is full it contracts, forcing more blood into the ventricle. The atrium has thin muscular walls because it receives blood at low pressure from the inferior vena cava and the superior vena cava and it needs to exert relatively little pressure to move the blood into the ventricle. One-way semilunar valves (like the valves in veins described in Section\u00a01B.3) at the entrance to the atrium stop a backflow of  blood into the veins.\n3\n \nThe tricuspid valve consists of  three flaps and is also \nknown as an atrioventricular valve because it separates an atrium from a ventricle. The valve allows blood to pass from the atrium to the ventricle, but not in the other direction. The tough tendinous cords, also known as valve tendons or heartstrings, make sure the valves are not turned inside out by the pressure exerted when the ventricles contract.\n4\n T\nhe right ventricle is filled with blood under some pressure \nwhen the right atrium contracts, then the ventricle contracts. Its muscular walls produce the pressure needed to force blood out of  the heart into the pulmonary arteries. These carry the deoxygenated blood to the capillaries in the lungs. As the ventricle starts to contract, the tricuspid valve closes to prevent blood flowing into the atrium. Semilunar valves, like those in veins, prevent the blood flowing back from the arteries into the ventricle.\n5\n T\nhe blood returns from the lungs to the left side of  the heart in \nthe pulmonary veins. The blood is at relatively low pressure after passing through the extensive capillaries of  the lungs. The blood returns to the left atrium, another thin-walled chamber that performs the same function as the right atrium. It contracts to force blood into the left ventricle. Backflow is prevented by another atrioventricular valve known as the bicuspid valve , which has only two flaps.\n6\n As the left a\ntrium contracts, the bicuspid valve opens and the \nleft ventricle is filled with blood under pressure. As the left ventricle starts to contract the bicuspid valve closes to prevent backflow of  blood to the left atrium. The left ventricle pumps the blood out of  the heart and into the aorta, the major artery of  the body. This carries blood away from the heart at even higher pressure than the major arteries that branch off  from it. \nThe muscular wall of  the left side of  the heart is much thicker than that of  the right. The right side pumps blood to the lungs, which are relatively close to the heart. The delicate capillaries of  the lungs need blood delivered at relatively low pressure. The left side must produce sufficient force to move the blood under pressure to all the extremities of  the body and overcome the elastic recoil of  the arteries. Semilunar valves prevent the blood flowing back from the aorta into the ventricle.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that the valves do not operate on their own. They open \nand close as blood pressure changes in the chambers on either side of the valve. When the pressure is higher on one side it will push the valve open. When it is higher on the other side, it will close the valve.\nThe septum is a thick wall of  muscle and connective tissue \nbetween the two sides of  the heart. It prevents the oxygenated blood mixing with the deoxygenated blood. \nDID YOU KNOW? \nIn an embryo, there is a gap in the septum called the foramen ovale and the blood from the two sides of the heart can mix. This does not matter because the lungs of the fetus do not function and little blood flows to them. At birth, this hole closes over as the lungs begin to function. If it does not, the baby has a condition called patent foramen ovale or \u2018hole in the heart\u2019 . This may be  so small it does not really matter. If it is large, it must be closed  by surgery.\nDID YOU KNOW? \nInside the heart\nThe diagrams we use of the inside of a mammalian heart make it \nlook very clean and simple (see fig A). But when you dissect the heart of a mammal such as a sheep or a cow, you can see that it is much more complicated. Cutting open a heart and exploring the connections between the blood vessels and the chambers of the heart, and seeing the structure of the valves, helps you understand how it works as a three-dimensional pump (see fig C).\n\u25b2 fig C  A dissected mammalian heart\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

There are certain factors that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.Most Cardiovascular Disease Starts with Atheroma Formationelastic tissue in wall1) The wall of an artery is made up of several layers (see p. 70).2) The endothelium (inner lining) is usually smooth and unbroken.3) If damage occurs to the endothelium (e.g. by high blood pressure) white blood cells (mostly macrophages) and lipids (fat) from the blood, clump together under the lining to form fatty streaks.4) Over time, more white blood cells, lipids and connective tissue build up and harden to form a fibrous plaque called an atheroma.5) This plaque partially blocks the lumen of the artery and restricts blood flow, which causes blood pressure to increase.6) Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a type of cardiovascular disease.It occurs when the coronary arteries have lots of atheromas in them, which restricts blood flow to the heart muscle. It can lead to myocardial infarction (see below).Atheromas Increase the Risk of Aneurysm and ThrombosisTwo types of disease that affect the arteries are:Aneurysm \u2014 a balloon-like swelling of the artery.1) Atheroma plaques damage and weaken arteries.They also narrow arteries, increasing blood pressure.2) When blood travels through a weakened artery at high pressure, it may push the inner layers of the artery through the outer elastic layer to form a balloon-like swelling \u2014 an aneurysm.3) This aneurysm may burst, causing a haemorrhage (bleeding).Thrombosis \u2014 formation of a blood clot.1) An atheroma plaque can rupture (burst through) the endothelium (inner lining) of an artery.2) This damages the artery wall and leaves a rough surface.3) Platelets and fibrin (a protein) accumulate at the site of damage and form a blood clot (a thrombus).4) This blood clot can cause a complete blockage of the artery, or it can become dislodged and block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body.5) Debris from the rupture can cause another blood clot to form further down the artery.Interrupted Blood Flow to the Heart can Cause a Myocardial Infarction1) The heart muscle is supplied with blood by the coronary arteries.2) This blood contains the oxygen needed by heart muscle cells to carry out respiration.3) If a coronary artery becomes completely blocked (e.g. by a blood clot) an area of the heart muscle will be totally cut off from its blood supply, receiving no oxygen.4) This causes a myocardial infarction \u2014 more commonly known as a heart attack.5) A heart attack can cause damage and death of the heart muscle.6) Symptoms include pain in the chest and upper body, shortness of breath and sweating.7) If large areas of the heart are affected complete heart failure can occur, which is often fatal.aneurysmnormal arterythick muscle* layerdeposits of fatty material, dead cells, white blood cells and connective tissuedeposits of fatty material etc. build up and push out endothelium to form an atheromalumen(space in centre)endothelium\nlumen shrinks as artery wall swells, so it's more difficult for blood to pass through\nTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n","48":"MAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS 46 1B.5 ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nsolve a severe problem permanently.

As you have seen, the wall of  an artery affected  by a plaque is stiffened, making it much more likely to suffer cracks or damage. Platelets touch the damaged surface of  the plaque and the clotting process is triggered (see Section 1B.2). The plaque itself  may rupture and break open, and the cholesterol that is released will also cause the platelets to trigger the blood clotting process. A clot may also develop because the endothelial lining is damaged, for example by high blood pressure or smoking.\nA clot that forms in a blood vessel is known as a thrombosis.  \nThe clot can rapidly block the whole blood vessel, particularly if  it is already narrowed by a plaque. A clot that gets stuck in a coronary artery is known as a coronary thrombosis. The clot  can block the artery, starving the heart muscle beyond that point of  oxygen and nutrients, and this often leads to a heart attack  (see fig E).Blargest heart attack\n(cardiac arre st) follows\nif blockage is at C\nmedium heart attack \u2013 death \nof some heart tissue if blockage is at Bsmall heart attack \u2013 death of small amount of heart tissue if blockage is at AABC\n\u25b2 fig E  T he size and severity of a heart attack is closely related to the \nposition of the blockage in the coronary artery.\nDuring a heart attack, there is chest pain in the same areas as in \nan angina attack, but it is much more severe. The pain may occur at any time, although exercise may start it, and it often lasts for several hours. Death may occur very rapidly with no previous symptoms, or it may happen after several days of  feeling tired and suffering symptoms mistaken for indigestion.\nIt is very important to react quickly if  you suspect someone is \nhaving a heart attack. Give them two full-strength aspirin tablets to help stop the blood clotting, and get them to hospital as fast as you can.\nSTROKES\nA stroke is caused by an interruption to the normal blood supply to an area of  the brain. This may be due to bleeding from damaged capillaries or a blockage cutting off  the blood supply to the brain. A blockage is usually caused by a blood clot, an atheroma or a combination of  the two. Sometimes, the blood clot forms somewhere else in the body and is carried in the bloodstream until it gets stuck in an artery in the brain. The damage happens very quickly. A blockage in one of  the main arteries leading to the brain causes a very serious stroke that may lead to death. In one of  the smaller arterioles leading into the brain, the effects may be less disastrous.\nThe symptoms of  strokes vary, depending on how much of  the \nbrain is affected. Very often, the blood is cut off  from one part or one side of  the brain only (see fig F). Symptoms include dizziness, confusion, slurred speech, blurred vision or partial loss of  vision (usually one eye) and numbness. In more severe strokes, there can be paralysis, usually on one side of  the body.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

We need to show \nhow one thing causes another and we still don\u2019t really know how fruit and vegetables have their effect. They are very varied in their chemistry. For some time, it was thought that the antioxidants found in fruit and vegetables might be the answer. Vitamins, such as vitamin A found in carrots, vitamin C from citrus fruits and vitamin E from leafy green vegetables, almonds and sunflower oil, are antioxidants and they are found in fruits and vegetables. Several studies appeared to show that antioxidants were the answer and many people started taking antioxidant supplements to protect their hearts. However, recent studies, including some very large metadata analyses (studies where scientists have looked at the results of  many different investigations), have shown that the evidence for antioxidants being good for your heart is inconclusive. There is some evidence that some antioxidants may cause harm.\nVITAMIN C: A CASE STUDY\nVitamin C is important in the formation of  connective tissue in the body, such as in the bones, teeth, skin and many internal body surfaces including the endothelial lining of  blood vessels. A severe lack of  vitamin C in the diet causes scurvy, which can result in bleeding gums, bruising easily and painful joints. As you have seen, if  the lining of  an artery is damaged, atherosclerosis is more likely to develop. So, it makes sense, in theory, that if  your diet is low in vitamin C, your arteries are more likely to be damaged and you are more likely to be affected by CVD. \nA study published in the British Medical Journal in 1997 looked at the association between \nconcentration of  vitamin C in the blood and risk of  heart attack in 1605 men from eastern Finland. The men had no sign of  coronary artery disease when they were tested between 1984 and 1989. Their vitamin C levels were also tested.

These cells accumulate chemicals from the blood, especially cholesterol. This leads to a plaque (also known as an atheroma) forming on the endothelial lining of  the artery (see fig C). Fibrous tissue and calcium salts also build up (increase in amount) around the atheroma, turning it into a hardened plaque. This hardened area means that part of  the artery wall is less elastic and narrower than it should be. This is atherosclerosis and is summarised in fig B.\nThe plaque causes the lumen of  the artery to become much smaller. This increases the blood \npressure, making it harder for the heart to pump blood around the body. The raised blood pressure makes damage more likely in other areas of  the endothelial lining and more plaques will form.  This will make the blood pressure even higher, and so the problem gets worse. There are many factors that are linked to the development of  atherosclerosis. Y ou will look at these in more detail  in Chapter 1C.\nEFFECT OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS ON HEALTH\nAtherosclerosis can have many serious effects on the health of  an individual. The development  of  atherosclerosis can be summarised as: damage to the endothelium of  the arteries \u2192 inflammatory response \u2192 accumulation of  cholesterol \u2192 atheroma \u2192 fibrous tissue\/calcium salts \u2192 plaque \u2192 narrowing\/loss of  elasticity of  the artery.\nANEURYSMS\nIf  an area of  an artery is narrowed by plaque, blood tends to collect behind the blockage. The artery bulges and the wall is put under more pressure than usual, so it becomes weakened. This is known as an aneurysm. The weakened artery wall may split open, leading to massive internal bleeding. Aneurysms frequently happen in the blood vessels supplying the brain or in the aorta, especially when it passes through the abdomen. The massive blood loss and drop in blood pressure are often fatal, but if  aneurysms are diagnosed they can be treated by surgery before they burst.\nRAISED BLOOD PRESSURE\nThe arteries narrowed due to plaques on the walls cause raised blood pressure. This can lead to severe damage in a number of  organs, including the kidneys, the eyes and the brain. The high pressure damages the tiny blood vessels where your kidney filters out urea and other substances from the blood. If  the vessels feeding the kidney tubules become narrowed, the pressure inside them gets even higher and proteins may be forced out through their walls. If  you have high blood pressure, your doctors can test for protein in your urine as a sign of  kidney damage. \nSimilarly, the tiny blood vessels supplying the retina of  your eye are easily damaged. If  they become \nblocked or leak, the retinal cells are starved of  oxygen and die and this can cause blindness. \nBleeding from the capillaries into the brain results in one type of  stroke (see below).\nHEART DISEASE\nThere are many kinds of  heart disease, but the two most common ones are angina and myocardial \ninfarction (heart attack); both are closely linked to atherosclerosis (see figs B and D ).\nIn angina, plaques build up slowly in the coronary arteries, reducing blood flow to the parts of  the heart muscle beyond the plaques. Often symptoms are first noticed during exercise, when the cardiac muscle is working harder and needs more oxygen. The narrowed coronary arteries cannot supply enough oxygenated blood and the heart muscle resorts to anaerobic respiration. This causes a gripping pain in the chest that can extend into the arms, particularly the left one, and the jaw, and often also causes breathlessness. The symptoms of  angina subside once exercise stops, but the experience is painful and frightening.\nFortunately, most angina is relatively mild. It can be helped by taking regular exercise, losing weight \nand not smoking. The symptoms can be treated by drugs that cause rapid dilation of  the coronary blood vessels so that they supply the cardiac muscle with the oxygen it needs. However, if  the blockage of  the coronary arteries continues to get worse, so will the symptoms of  the angina. Other drugs are then used to dilate the blood vessels and reduce the heart rate. Unfortunately, drugs cannot \n\u25b2 fig C  F atty deposits like these \nin an artery cause disease and death in millions of people  every year.\nEXAM HINT\nMake sure you are clear about \nall of the different terms.

This is \nexplained in more detail in Chapter 21.\nKEY CONCEPT LINK\nEvaluation of the impact on \u2018host\u2019 countries \nof multinational operations\nTh e  p o t e n t i a l  bene fi ts are clear:\n\u25a0 The investment will bring in foreign currency and, if output \nfrom the plant is exported, further foreign exchange can be \nearned.\n\u25a0 Employment opportunities will be created and training \nprogrammes will improve the quality and e ff iciency of local \npeople.\n\u25a0 Local firms are likely to benefit from supplying services \nand components to the new factory and this will generate \nadditional jobs and incomes.\n\u25a0 Local firms will be forced to bring their quality and \nproductivity up to international standards either to \ncompete with the multinational or to supply to it.\n\u25a0 Tax revenues to the government will be boosted from any \nprofits made by the multinational.\n\u25a0 Management expertise in the community will slowly \nimprove when and if the foreign supervisors and \nmanagers are replaced by local sta ff , once they are \nsuitably qualified.\n\u25a0 The total output of the economy will be increased and this \nwill raise gross domestic product.\nIt will not be all good news, however. Th e expansion of \nmultinational corporations into a country could lead to \nthese drawbacks :\n\u25a0 Exploitation of the local workforce might take place. Due \nto the absence of strict labour and health and safety rules \nin some countries, multinationals can employ cheap \nlabour for long hours with few of the benefits that the \nstaff  in their home country would demand. Recent poor \npublicity has forced the Gap and Nike clothing companies to \nimprove their monitoring of the employment of illegal child \nworkers at factories that produce their clothes in Thailand. \nHow many large businesses would not care about these \npractices, especially as the factories are so far removed \nfrom Western media investigation?\n\u25a0 Pollution from plants might be at higher levels than allowed \nin other countries. Either this could be because of slack \nrules or because the host government is afraid of driving \nthe multinational away if it insists on environmentally \nacceptable practices. This is a sign of the great influence \nmultinationals can have.\u25a0 Local competing firms may be squeezed out of business due \nto inferior equipment and much smaller resources than the \nlarge multinational.\n\u25a0 Some large Western-based businesses, such as McDonald\u2019s \nand Coca-Cola, have been accused of imposing Western \nculture on other societies by the power of advertising \nand promotion. This could lead to a reduction in cultural \nidentity.\n\u25a0 Profits may be sent back to the country where the head \noff ice of the company is based, rather than kept for \nreinvestment in the host nation.\n\u25a0 Extensive depletion of the limited natural resources of some \ncountries has been blamed on some large multinational \ncorporations. The argument is that they have little incentive \nto conserve these resources, as they are able to relocate \nquickly to other countries once resources have run out.\nTOP TIP\nIn case study questions on multinational business \nactivity, you may have the opportunity to use examples \nfrom your own country as well as from the case study to \nsupport your answers.

However, \nthe main aspect of privatisation is the transfer of \nownership of nationalised (state-owned) industries into \nthe private sector by creating public limited companies. \nTh is policy began in the UK in the 1980s, but is now \nwidespread throughout most mixed economies. Th e  l i s t  \nof privatised companies in Europe is very extensive and \nincludes British Airways, Deutsche Telekom and Skoda. \nTh e main argument used by supporters of privatisation \nis that business enterprises will use resources much more \neffi  ciently in the private sector, as they will be driven by \nthe pro fi t motive. Th ose against the policy argue that \nthe state can pursue other objectives apart from just \nmaking a pro fi t through public-sector enterprises and \nthat\u00a0privatisation nearly always leads to job losses in \norder \u00a0to cut costs.\nPrivatisation: selling state-owned and controlled \nbusiness organisations to investors in the private sector.\nKEY TERM656: Business structure  ","53":"148Control of Blood Glucose ConcentrationThese pages are all about how homeostasis sorts out your blood glucose level so you can keep revising.Eating and Exercise Change the Concentration of Glucose in your Blood1) All cells need a constant energy supply to work \u2014 so blood glucose concentration must be carefully controlled.2) The concentration of glucose in the blood is normally around 90 mg per 100 cm3 of blood.It's monitored by cells in the pancreas.3) Blood glucose concentration rises after eating food containing carbohydrate.Blood glucose concentration falls after exercise, as more glucose is used in respiration to release energy.Insulin and Glucagon Control Blood Glucose ConcentrationThe hormonal system controls blood glucose concentration using two hormones called insulin and glucagon.Like all hormones, insulin and glucagon travel in the blood to .... , ,, ,their target cells (effectors).

Uracil always pairs with adenine during protein synthesis. RNA isn't all the same though. You need to know about:(Messenger RNA (mRNA))mRNA is made during transcription (see below). It carries the genetic code from the DNA to the ribosomes, where it's used to make a protein during translation (see next page). mRNA is a single ^ Basepolynucleotide strand.In mRNA, groups of three adjacent bases are usually called codons (they're sometimes Phosphate called triplets or base triplets).

In many cases, the family that founded the \nbusiness retains complete ownership of it. Family-owned \nbusinesses are very important in nearly all economies, \nespecially newly industrialising ones. It is estimated that \n80% of all businesses in South Africa are family owned \nand operated. Many family businesses are small \u00a0\u2013 65% \nof all small businesses in Malaysia are family-owned and \nmanaged. However, not all family businesses are small. In \nAsia, family businesses make up 50% of all public limited \ncompanies (67% in India) and the founding families \nstill retain a controlling interest (over 50% of shares). \nFamily businesses have several signi fi cant strengths and \nweaknesses \u00a0\u2013 see  Table 3.5.Disadvantages of small businesses Disadvantages of large businesses\n\u25a0 may have limited access to sources of finance\n\u25a0 the owner\/s has\/have to carry a large burden of \nresponsibility if unable to a ff ord to employ specialist \nmanagers\n\u25a0 may not be diversified, so there are greater risks of \nnegative impact of external change\n\u25a0 few opportunities for economies of scale\u25a0 may be di ff icult to manage, especially if geographically \nspread\n\u25a0 may have potential cost increases associated with large-\nscale production\n\u25a0 may su ff er from slow decision-making and poor \ncommunication due to the structure of the large \norganisation\n\u25a0 may o ft en su ff er from a divorce between ownership and \ncontrol that can lead to conflicting objectives\nTable 3.4 Potential disadvantages of small and large businesses\nStrengths Weaknesses\nCommitment:  The family owners o ft en show dedication in \nseeing the business grow, prosper and get passed on to future \ngenerations. As a result, many family members identify with \nthe company and have the incentive to work harder and \nreinvest part of their profits into the business to allow it to \ngrow in the long term.\nReliability and pride:  Because family businesses have their \nname and reputation associated with their products, they \nstrive to increase the quality of their output and to maintain a \ngood relationship with their stakeholders.\nKnowledge continuity:  Families in business make it a priority \nto pass their accumulated knowledge, experience and skills to \nthe next generation. Many family members become involved \nin the family business from a very young age. This increases \ntheir level of commitment and could provide them with the \nnecessary tools to run their family business.Succession\/continuity problem:  Many family businesses fail \nto be sustainable in the long term. On average only around \n15% continue into the third generation of the descendants \nof the founder(s). This high rate of failure among family \nbusinesses can o ft en be explained by the lack of skills and \nability of later generations or the splitting of management \nresponsibilities between several family members to give them \nall a role in it.\nInformality:  Because most families run their businesses \nthemselves, there is usually little interest in setting clear and \nformal business practices and procedures. As the family and \nits business grow larger, this situation can lead to ine ff iciencies \nand internal conflicts.\nTraditional:  There is quite o ft en a reluctance to change \nsystems and procedures, preferring to continue to operate \nas it was historically run.

First though, you need to make up several solutions of different, known concentrations to test the cylinders in.

This movement drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pj).6) This process of ATP production driven by the movement of H+ ions across a membrane (due to electrons moving down an electron transport chain) is called chemiosmosis (which is described by the chemiosmotic theory).7) In the mitochondrial matrix, at the end of the transport chain, the protons, electrons and 02 (from the blood) combine to form water.Oxygen is said to be the final electron acceptor.outer mitochondrial membrane intermembrane space inner mitochondrial membrane ---------------%---------------------High H\u2019 concentration H+ H+ H+ HH+ H+ H+\u2022P,H+Low H* concentrationATPATP synthaseTopic 5 A \u2014 Photosynthesis and Respiration\n","61":"762The Chi-Squared Testlust when you thought it was safe to turn the page... I stick in some maths. Surprise!The Chi-Squared Test Can Be Used to Check the Results of Genetic Crosses1) The chi-squared (%2) test is a statistical test that's used to see if the results of an experiment support a theory.2) First, the theory is used to predict a result \u2014 this is called the expected result.Then, the experiment is carried out and the actual result is recorded \u2014 this is called the observed result.3) To see if the results support the theory you have to make a hypothesis called the null hypothesis.4) The null hypothesis is always that there's no significant difference between the observed and expected results(your experimental result will usually be a bit different from what you expect, but you need to know if the difference is just due to chance, or because your theory is wrong).5) The x2 test is then carried out to compare the 'goodness of fit' of the observed and expected results(i.e. to compare how well the observed results match the expected results). The outcome either supports orrejects the null hypothesis.6) You can use the x2  test in genetics to test theories about the inheritance of characteristics. For example:Theory: Wing length in fruit flies is controlled by a single gene with two alleles (monohybrid inheritance).The dominant allele (N) gives normal wings, and the recessive allele (n) gives vestigial wings.Expected results: With monohybrid inheritance, if you cross a homozygous dominant parent with a homozygous recessive parent, you'd expect a 3 : 1 phenotypic ratio of normal : vestigial wings in the F, generation (see p. 156).Observed results: The experiment (of crossing a homozygous dominant parent with a homozygous recessive parent) is carried out on fruit flies and the number of F2 offspring with normal and vestigial wings is counted.Null hypothesis: There's no significant difference between the observed and \\ u i n n i \\ i' 111 _i' n 1111111' Mexpected results.

Here are two really colourful photosynthesis experiments for you to enjoy. Let's chop up some plants and marvel at the beauty of Biology...You Can Investigate the Pigments in Leaves Using Chromatography1) All plants contain several different photosynthetic pigments in their leaves.Each pigment absorbs a different wavelength of light, so having more than one type of pigment increases the range of wavelengths of light that a plant can absorb.2) In addition to photosynthetic pigments, some plants also have other pigments in their leaves,which play other essential roles, e.g. protecting the leaves from excessive UV radiation.Different species of plants contain different proportions and mixtures of pigments.3) You can use thin layer chromatography (TLC) todetermine what pigments are present in the leaves of a plant. Like all chromatography, TLC involves:4) A sample of pigments can be extracted from the plant and put on the TLC plate. When the plate is placed vertically in the solvent, the solvent moves upwards through the gel, carrying the dissolved pigments with it.Some pigments will travel faster or further through the gel than others, which separates them out.5) It's possible to identify a certain pigment by calculating its Rf value and looking it up in a database. The Rf value is the distance a substance has moved through the gel in relation to the solvent. Each pigment has a specific Rf value.A mobile phase \u2014 where molecules can move. In TLC, this is a liquid solvent.A stationary phase \u2014 where molecules can't move. In TLC, this consists of a solid (e.g. glass) plate with a thin layer of gel (e.g. silica gel) on top.TLC can be Used to Compare the Pigments in Different PlantsThis example shows you how to use TLC to compare the pigments present in shade-tolerant plants andshade-intolerant plants.

Two distinct layers will form in the liquid\u2014 the top layer is the pigments mixed in with the petroleum ether.3) Transfer some of the liquid from the top layer into a second test tube with some anhydrous sodium sulfate.4) Draw a horizontal pencil line near the bottom of a TLC plate.Build up a single concentrated spot of the liquid from step 3 on the line by applying several drops and ensuring each one is drybefore the next is added. This is the point of origin.5) Once the point of origin is completely dry, put the plate into a small glasscontainer with some prepared solvent (e.g. a mixture of propanone, cyclohexaneand petroleum ether) \u2014 just enough so that the point of origin is a little bit above solvent the solvent. Put a lid on the container and leave the plate to develop. As the solvent spreads up the plate, the different pigments move with it, but at different rates \u2014 so they separate.6) When the solvent has nearly reached the top, take the plate out and mark the solvent front (the furthest point the solvent has reached) with a pencil and leave the plate to dry in a well-ventilated place.7) There should be several new coloured spots on the chromatography plate between the point of origin and the solvent front. These are the separated pigments. You can calculate their Rf values and look them up in a database to identify what the pigments are.8) Repeat the process for the shade-intolerant plant you're investigating and compare the pigments present in their leaves.solvent frontspcts of separated pigmentspoint of origin\ndistance travelled by spot distance travelled by solventYou may find that the mixture of pigments in the leaves of the shade-tolerant plant is quite different compared to the shade- intolerant plant. Ore way that shade-tolerant plants can adapt to the light conditions in their environment is by possessing a different proportion of photosynthetic pigments, which allows the plant to make the best use of the light available to it. The mixture of non-photosyntetic pigments is also likely to be different. For example, the chloroplasts of shade-tolerant plants are adapted for photosynthesis in low light conditions, but really sensitive to higher levels of light. These plants sometimes produce dark red and purple pigments called anthocyanins, which are thought to protect their chloroplasts from brief exposure to higher light levels.Topic 5A \u2014 Photosynthesis and Respiration\n","63":"9 1A.2 CARBOHYDRATES 1 CHEMISTRY FOR BIOLOGISTS\n \u2022P entose sugars (n = 5) have five carbon atoms and the \ngeneral formula C5H10O5.

The arrangement of the atoms \non the side chains can make a significant difference to the way in which the molecule can be used by the body. The carbon atoms are numbered in order to identify the different arrangements.\nGlucose has two isomers (different forms): \u03b1-glucose and \n\u03b2-glucose. The two isomers have different arrangements of  the atoms on the side chains of  the molecule. The\u00a0different isomers form different bonds between neighbouring glucose molecules, and this affects the polymers that are made. Y ou will learn more about \u03b1- and \u03b2-glucose in Section 4A.5.\nDID YOU KNOW? \nHydrogenating some sugars reduces the energy they provide. When glucose is hydrogenated, it forms sorbitol (C\n6H14O6). Sorbitol \ntastes up to 60% sweeter than glucose but it provides less energy when it is used in the body (11\n kJg\u22121 compared to 17  kJg\u22121). The \ncombination of the very sweet taste and the lower energy count makes it useful as a sweetener for people who want to lose weight.

Two monosaccharides join in a condensation reaction to form a disaccharide, and a molecule of  water (H\n2O) is released. The \nlink between the two monosaccharides results in a covalent bond known as a glycosidic bond (see fig E). We use numbers to show which carbon atoms are involved in the bond. If  carbon 1 on one monosaccharide joins to carbon 4 on another monosaccharide, we call it a 1,4-glycosidic bond.

If only there was a way to stimulate memory cell production without getting the disease... well, there is \u2014 vaccination.Vaccines can Protect Individuals and Populations Against Disease1) While your B-cells are busy dividing to build up their numbers to deal with a pathogen (i.e. the primary response \u2014 see previous page), you suffer from the disease. Vaccination can help avoid this.2) Vaccines contain antigens that cause your body to produce memory cells against a particular pathogen, without the pathogen causing disease. This means you become immune without getting any symptoms.3) Vaccines protect individuals that have them and, because they reduce the occurrence of the disease, those not vaccinated are also less likely to catch the disease (because there are fewer people to catch it from). This is called herd immunity.4) Vaccines always contain antigens \u2014 these may be free or attached to a dead or attenuated (weakened) pathogen.5) Vaccines may be injected or taken orally. The disadvantages of taking a vaccine orally are that it could be broken down by enzymes in the gut or the molecules of the vaccine may be too large to be absorbed into the blood.6) Sometimes booster vaccines are given later on (e.g. after several years) to make sure that memory cells are produced.Antigenic Variation Helps Some Pathogens Evade the Immune System1) Antigens on the surface of pathogens activate the primary response.2) When you're infected a second time with the same pathogen (which has the same antigens on its surface) they activate the secondary response and you don't get ill.3) However, some sneaky pathogens can change their surface antigens. This antigen variability is called antigenic variation. (Different antigens are formed due to changes in the genes of a pathogen.)4) This means that when you're infected for a second time, the memory cells produced from the first infection will not recognise the different antigens. So the immune system has to start from scratch and carry out a primary response against these new antigens.5) This primary response takes time to get rid of the infection, which is why you get ill again.6) Antigenic variation also makes it difficult to develop vaccines against some pathogens for the same reason. Examples of pathogens that show antigenic variation include HIV and the influenza virus.7) Here's how antigenic variation affects the production of vaccines to help prevent people catching influenza:1) The influenza (flu) vaccine changes every year. That's because the antigens on the surface of the influenza virus change regularly, forming new strains of the virus.2) Memory cells produced from vaccination with one strain of the flu will not recognise other strains with different antigens. The strains are immunologically distinct.3) Every year there are different strains of the influenza virus circulating in the population, so a different vaccine has to be made.4) New vaccines are developed and one is chosen every year that is the most effective against the recently circulating influenza viruses.5) Governments and health authorities then implement a programme of vaccination using the most suitable vaccine.1st infection\n2nd infectiondifferent antigensThe oral vaccine was proving hard to swallow.\nTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","65":"38Exchange Across Cell Membranes \u2014 DiffusionOoooh it's starting to get a bit more exciting... here's how some substances can get across cell membranes without using energy, just what you've always wanted to know, I bet.Diffusion is the Passive Movement of Particles1) Diffusion is the net movement of particles (molecules or ions) from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.2) Molecules will diffuse both ways, but the net movement will be to the area of lower concentration. This continues until particles are evenly distributed throughout the liquid or gas.3) The concentration gradient is the path from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Particles diffuse down a concentration gradient4) Diffusion is a passive process \u2014 no energy is needed for it to happen.5) Particles can diffuse across cell membranes, as long as they can move freely through the membrane.111' h 1 I I I  I  I IF! , M,,,, (\/Polar molecules have Z ~ Partlal positive and negative ~ charges (see p. 20).

They're also non-polar, which makes them soluble in lipids, so they can dissolve in the hydrophobic bilayer.6) When molecules diffuse directly through a cell membrane, it's also known as simple diffusion.Facilitated Diffusion uses Carrier Proteins and Protein Channels1) Some larger molecules (e.g. amino acids, glucose) would diffuse extremely slowly through the phospholipid bilayer because they're so big.2) Charged particles, e.g. ions and polar molecules, would also diffuse slowly \u2014 that'sbecause they're water soluble, and the centre of the bilayer is hydrophobic (see page 36).3) So to speed things up, large or charged particles diffuse through carrier proteins or channel proteins in the membrane instead \u2014 this is called facilitated diffusion.4) Like diffusion, facilitated diffusion moves particles down a concentration gradient, from a higher to a lower concentration.5) It's also a passive process \u2014 it doesn't use energy.'fiAndy needed all his concentration for this particular gradient...Carrier proteins move large molecules across membranes, down their concentration gradient.

They're not even living things \u2014 they can only reproduce inside the cells of another organism (called the host). All viruses cause disease, and you need to know all about one particularly nasty blighter...HIV is the Virus That Causes AIDS1) HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that affects the immune system.It eventually leads to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).2) AIDS is a condition where the immune system deteriorates and eventually fails. This makes someone with AIDS more vulnerable to other infections, like pneumonia (see next page).3) HIV infects (and eventually kills) helperT-cells, which act as the host cells (see p. 28) for the virus. Remember, helper T-cells send chemical signals that activate phagocytes, cytotoxic T-cells and B-cells (see p. 44) so they're hugely important cells in the immune response. Without enough helper T-cells, the immune system is unable to mount an effective response to infections because other immune system cells don't behave how they should.4) People infected with HIV develop AIDS when the helper T-cell numbers in their body reach a critically low level.HIV has a Spherical StructureYou might get asked about the structure of HIV in your exam1) A core that contains the genetic material (RNA) and some proteins (including the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is needed for virus replication).2) An outer coating of protein called a capsid.3) An extra outer layer called an envelope. This is made of membrane stolen from the cell membrane of a previous host cell.4) Sticking out from the envelope are loads of copies of an attachment protein that help HIV attach to thehost helper T-cell.HIV Replicates Inside its Host\u2019s Helper T-CellsHIV (and all other viruses) can only reproduce inside the cells of the organism it has infected. HIV replicates inside the helper T-cells of the host. It doesn't have the equipment (such as enzymes and ribosomes) to replicate on its own, so it uses those of the host cell.Here's how HIV replicates:1) The attachment protein attaches to a receptor molecule on the cell membrane of the host helper T-cell.2) The capsid is released into the cell, where it uncoats and releases the genetic material (RNA) into the cell's cytoplasm.3) Inside the cell, reverse transcriptase is used to make a complementary strand of DNA from the viral RNA template (see p. 16-17 for more on DNA and RNA).4) From this, double-stranded DNA is made and inserted into the human DNA.5) Host cell enzymes are used to make viral proteins from theviral DNA found within the human DNA.6) The viral proteins are assembled into new viruses, which bud from the cell and go on to infect other cells.During the initial infection period, HIV replicates rapidly and the infected person may experience severe flu-likesymptoms. After this period, HIV replication drops to a lower level. This is the latency period. During the latency period (which can last for years), the infected person won't experience any symptoms.Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\u00a9HIVhelper T cellDNA\u00a9\u00aev \u201c \u201c  DAttachment protein CapsidS1 , \" \"........................u-n,,,,,._ ttachnient proteins can also -EnvelopeGeneticmaterialReverse transcriptase\n","67":"io4 Topic 5 A \u2014 Photosynthesis and RespirationPhotosynthesis, Respiration and ATPAll organisms need energy for life processes (and you'll need some for revising), so it's pretty important stuff.

Here's a quick recap:AdenineATPPhosphate groupsPhosphate bond1) A cell can't get its energy directly from glucose.2) So, in respiration, the energy released from glucose is used to make ATP (adenosine triphosphate).ATP carries energy around the cell to where it's needed.3) ATP is synthesised via a condensation reaction between ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (P.) using energy from an energy-releasing reaction, e.g. the breakdown of glucose in respiration. The energy is stored as chemical energy in the phosphate bond. The enzyme ATP synthase catalyses this reaction.4) ATP diffuses to the part of the cell that needs energy.5) Here, it's hydrolysed back into ADP and inorganic phosphate (P;). Chemical energy is releasedfrom the phosphate bond and used by the cell. ATP hydrolase catalyses this reaction.6) The ADP and inorganic phosphate are recycled and the process starts again.Topic 5 A \u2014 Photosynthesis and Respiration\n","68":"106PhotosynthesisRight, pen at the ready.

They are found in plant cells.2) Thylakoids (fluid-filled sacs) are stacked up in the chloroplast into structures called grana (singular = granum).The grana are linked together by bits of thylakoid membrane called lamellae (singular = lamella).4) Chloroplasts contain photosynthetic pigments (e.g. chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotene). These are coloured substances that absorb the light energy needed for photosynthesis. The pigments are found in the thylakoid membranes \u2014 they're attached to proteins. The protein and pigment is called a photosystem.5) There are two photosystems used by plants to capture light energy.Photosystem I (or PSI) absorbs light best at a wavelength of 700 nm and photosystem II (PSII) absorbs light best at 680 nm.6) Contained within the inner membrane of the chloroplast and surrounding the thylakoids is a gel-like substance called the stroma. It contains enzymes, sugars and organic acids.7) Carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis and not used straight away are stored as starch grains in the stroma.outer memb'aneinner membrane stromathylakoid thylakoidmembrane lamellagranum(thylakoidcf arHPhotosynthesis can be Split into Two StagesThere are actually two stages that make up photosynthesis:crsmmammmm________cn- See p.' 108 for \\oad% more* * ' \u20141) As the name suggests, this reaction needs light energy.2) It takes place in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts.3) Here, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll (and other photosynthetic pigments) in the photosystems. The light energy excites the electrons in the chlorophyll, leading to their eventual release from the molecule.The chlorophyll has been photoionised.4) Some of the energy from the released electrons is used to add a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP, and some is used to reduce NADP to form reduced NADP. ATP transfers energy and reduced NADP transfers hydrogen to the light-independent reaction.5) During the process H^O is oxidised to 02.The Light-Independent Reaction1) This is also called the Calvin cycle and as the name suggests it doesn't use light energy directly. (But it does rely on the products of the light-dependent reaction.)2) It takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast.3) Here, the ATP and reduced NADP from the light-dependent reaction supply the energy and hydrogen to make simple sugars from CO,.\nIn the Light-Dependent Reaction ATP is Made by PhotophosphorylationIn the light-dependent reaction, the energy resulting from the photoionisation of chlorophyll is used for three things:1) Making ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. This reaction is called photophosphorylation (see p. 105).2) Making reduced NADP from NADP.3) Splitting water into protons (H+ ions), electrons and oxygen. This is called photolysis (see p. 105).The light-dependent reaction actually includes two types of photophosphorylation \u2014 non-cyclic and cyclic.Each of these processes has different products (see next page).Topic 5A \u2014 Photosynthesis and RespirationThis diagram shows how the two reactions link together in the chloroplast.thylakoid membrane Q.< c 0 ,e\n","69":"60The Effects of Lung DiseaseIt's all very well when your lungs are working perfectly; but some pathogens (and even your lifestyle) can muck them up good and proper. This can make it more difficult to breathe and reduce the rate of gas exchange.Measures of Lung Function Can Help to Diagnose Lung DiseasesLung diseases affect both ventilation (breathing) and gas exchange in the lungs \u2014 in other words, how well the lungs function. Doctors can carry out tests to investigate lung function and diagnose a lung disease. You might be asked to interpret results from tests like these in your exams. Here are some terms you might come across:1) Tidal volume is the volume of air in each breath \u2014 usually between 0.4 dm* and 0.5 dm* for adults.2) Ventilation rate is the number of breaths per minute. For a healthy person at rest it's about 15 breaths.3) Forced expiratory volumet (FEV1) is the maximum volume of air that can be breathed out in 1 second.4) Forced vital capacity (FVC) is the maximum volume of air it is possible to sV\\n m u n m i m ibreathe forcefully out of the lungs after a really deep breath in. \u201c stan s \u00b0r. z0\/1 - decimetres cubed, -X 1 dm3 is the same -You can figure out tidal volume, ventilation rate and other measures of breathing from the graph produced from a spirometer (a fancy machine that scientists and doctors use to measure the volume of air breathed in and out):9. as a litre. :\nMeasuring tidal volume is one of the hardest jobs in the world.Different Diseases Affect the Lungs in Different WaysHere are some examples of different lung diseases and how they affect breathing.Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB)1) When someone becomes infected with tuberculosis bacteria, immune system cells build a wall around the bacteria in the lungs. This forms small, hard lumps known as tubercles.2) Infected tissue within the tubercles dies and the gaseous exchange surface is damaged, so tidal volume is decreased.3) Tuberculosis also causes fibrosis (see below), which further reduces the tidal volume.4) A reduced tidal volume means less air can be inhaled with each breath. In order to take in enough oxygen, patients have to breathe faster, i.e. ventilation rate is increased.5) Common symptoms include a persistent cough, coughing up blood and mucus, chest pains, shortness of breath and fatigue.Fibrosis1) Fibrosis is the formation of scar tissue in the lungs.This can be the result of an infection or exposure to substances like asbestos or dust.2) Scar tissue is thicker and less elastic than normal lung tissue.3) This means that the lungs are less able to expand and so can't hold as much air as normal \u2014 tidal volume is reduced, and so is FVC (i.e. a smaller volume of air can be forcefully breathed out).4) There's a reduction in the rate of gaseous exchange \u2014 diffusion is slower across a thicker scarred membrane.5) Symptoms of fibrosis include shortness of breath, a dry cough, chest pain, fatigue and weakness.6) Fibrosis sufferers have a faster ventilation rate than normal \u2014 to get enough air into their lungs to oxygenate their blood.Topic 3A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","70":"Management and managers\nManagers  \u2018get things done\u2019 \u00a0\u2013 not by doing all jobs \nthemselves but by working with and delegating to \nother people. Managers do not all use the same style \nof leadership and di ff erent managers will approach \nproblems and decisions in very di ff erent ways, but the key \nfunctions of management are common to all. Th ese are \nbest explained by reference to some of the best-known \nmanagement writers, such as Fayol and Drucker. By \ncombining the main ideas of these two writers we can \narrive at the following list of management tasks and \nfunctions.\nManager:  responsible for setting objectives, organising \nresources and motivating sta ff  so that the organisation\u2019s \naims are met.\nKEY TERM\nThe functions of management \u00a0\u2013 what \nmanagers are responsible for\n1 Setting objectives and planning: All good managers \nthink ahead. Senior management will establish overall \nstrategic objectives and these will be translated into tactical \nobjectives for the less-senior managerial sta ff . The planning \nneeded to put these objectives into e ff ect is also important. \nA new production or marketing objective will require the \nplanning and preparation of su ff i c i en t  r eso u r c es.\n2 Organising resources to meet the objectives: This is \nnot just about giving instructions. People throughout the \nbusiness need to be recruited carefully and encouraged to \ntake some authority and to accept some accountability via \ndelegation. Senior managers will ensure that the structure \nof the business allows for a clear division of tasks and that \neach section or department is organised to allow them to \nwork towards the common objectives.\n3 Directing and motivating sta ff :  This means guiding, \nleading and overseeing of employees to ensure that \norganisational goals are being met. The significance of \ndeveloping sta ff  so that they are motivated to employ all \nof their abilities at work is now widely recognised. This will \nmake it more likely that organisational aims are achieved.\n4 Coordinating activities: As the average size of business \nunits increases \u00a0\u2013 especially true for multinationals \u00a0\u2013 so \nthe need to ensure consistency and coordination between \ndiff erent parts of each firm increases. The goals of each \nbranch, division, region and even all sta ff  must be welded \ntogether to achieve a common sense of purpose. At a \npractical level, this can mean avoiding the situation where \ntwo divisions of the same company both spend money \non researching into the same new product, resulting in \nwasteful duplication of e ff ort.5 Controlling and measuring performance against targets: \nManagement by objectives establishes targets for all groups, \ndivisions and individuals. It is management\u2019s responsibility \nto appraise performance against targets and to take action if \nunderperformance occurs. It is just as important to provide \npositive feedback when things keep going right.\nManagement roles\nTo carry out these functions, managers have to undertake \nmany di ff erent roles. Henry Mintzberg ( Th e Nature of \nManagerial Work , 1973) identi fi ed ten roles common to \nthe work of all managers. Th ese are divided into three \ngroups (see Table 10.1):\n\u25a0 Interpersonal roles \u00a0\u2013 dealing with and motivating sta ff  at all \nlevels of the organisation.\n\u25a0 Informational roles \u00a0\u2013 acting as a source, receiver and \ntransmitter of information.\n\u25a0 Decisional roles \u00a0\u2013 taking decisions and allocating resources \nto meet the organisation\u2019s objectives.\nLeadership \u00a0\u2013 the importance of it and \nqualities needed\nLeadership  is a key part of being a successful manager. \nIt involves setting a clear direction and vision for an \norganisation \u00a0\u2013 oft en a new direction and vision if \ncircumstances demand it \u00a0\u2013 that others will be prepared \nto follow. Employees will want to follow a good leader \nand will respond positively to them. A poor leader \nwill o ft en fail to win over sta ff  and will have problems \ncommunicating with and organising workers e ff ectively. \nTh e best managers are also good leaders of people \u00a0\u2013 but \nsome managers are not. Managers that focus so much on \ncontrol and allocation of people and resources can fail \nto provide a sense of purpose or focus that others will \nunderstand and be prepared to follow. Without clear and \ncharismatic leadership workers may be very well managed, \nbut will they be inspired to help the leader and the \nbusiness take a fresh direction and achieve new goals?\nLeadership:  the art of motivating a group of people \ntowards achieving a common objective.\nKEY TERM\nWhat makes a good leader? Many studies have been \nconducted on this very point \u00a0\u2013 some argue that leaders are \nborn with natural assets that create an aura or charisma \nthat others will fi nd appealing. Other research is more \ninclined to support the view that leaders can be trained \nto adopt the key attributes of good leadership.

The right side only needs to get blood to the lungs, which are nearby.2) The ventricles have thicker walls than the atria, because they have to push blood out of the heart whereas the atria just need to push blood a short distance into the ventricles.3) The atrioventricular (AV) valves link the atria to the ventricles and stop blood flowing back into the atria when the ventricles contract.4) The semi-lunar (SL) valves link the ventricles to the pulmonary artery and aorta, and stop blood flowing back into the heart after the ventricles contract.5) The cords attach the atrioventricular valves to the ventricles to stop them being forced up into the atria when the ventricles contract.Captain Jeff reckoned the lock gates were just like a big heart valve \u2014 with enough pressure he would be able to force his way through.The valves only open one way \u2014 whether they're open or closed depends on the relative pressure of the heart chambers.If there's higher pressure behind a valve, it's forced open, but if pressure is higher in front of the valve it's forced shut. This means blood only flows in one direction through the heart.higherlowerpressurepressureJLlowerhigherpressurepressurevalve closedvalve openTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n","72":"62Interpreting Lung Disease DataIt's very possible that you could be asked to interpret some data on lung disease in the exam. So being my usual nice sell I've given you some examples to show you how to do it. I know it looks a bit dull but believe me, it'll really help.You Need to be Able to Interpret Data on Risk Factors and Lung Disease1) All diseases have factors that will increase a person's chance of getting that disease. These are called risk factors. For example, it's widely known that if you smoke you're more likely to get lung cancer (smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer).2) This is an example of a correlation \u2014 a link between two things (see page 213). However, a correlation doesn't always mean that one thing causes the other. Smokers have an increased risk of getting cancer but that doesn't necessarily mean smoking causes the disease \u2014 there are lots of other factors to take into consideration.3) You need to be able to describe and analyse data given to you in your exams.Here's an example of the sort of thing you might get:EXAMPLE 1 \u2014 SMOKING AND LUNG CANCER\nCcQ nsO5040O-C d5 Uun T5302010Percentage of males aged 16 and over who smoked manufactured cigarettes in Great Britain\u2022\/vYear\u0000ip No) cv nrooooo120iAge-standardised mortality rates for male lung cancer in the United Kingdom1003 CX- o80604020Year of deaths<0 kOYou might be asked to:1) Describe the data \u2014 The graph on the left shows that the number of adult males in Great Britain who smoke decreased between 1990 and 2012. The graph on the right shows that the male lung cancer mortality (death) rate decreased between 1990 and 2012 in the United Kingdom.2) Draw conclusions \u2014You need to be careful what you say here. There's a correlation (link) between the number of males who smoked and the mortality rate for male lung cancer. But you can't say that one caused the other. There could be other reasons for the trend, e.g. deaths due to lung cancer may have decreased because less asbestos was being used in homes (not because fewer people were smoking).Other points to consider \u2014 The graph on the right shows mortality (death) rates. The rate of cases of lung cancer may have been increasing but medical advances may mean more people were surviving (so only mortality was decreasing).You might also need to evaluate the way in which scientific data has led to government restrictions on the sources of risk factors. E.g.Responses to dataMedical studies in 1950s and 1960s documented the link between smoking and various forms of cancer, particularly lung cancer. The evidence prompted the first voluntary agreement between the UK government and tobacco companies in 1971, which stated that tobacco products and adverts should carry a health warning label. As of October 2008, picture health warnings were made compulsory on all UK boxes of cigarettes after studies suggested they were more effective than written warnings alone.Topic 3A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","73":"1BSPECIFICATION \nREFERENCE5  A THEROSCLEROSIS\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n \u25fcUnder stand the course of events that lead to atherosclerosis.\nCARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES\nProblems with the cardiovascular system have serious consequences.

It can begin in late childhood and continues throughout life. A plaque can continue to develop until it restricts the flow of  blood through the artery or even blocks it completely. Plaques are most likely to form in the arteries of  the heart (coronary arteries) and neck (carotid arteries).

Atherosclerosis begins with damage to the \nendothelial lining of  blood vessels. This damage can be caused by several factors, including high blood pressure and substances in tobacco smoke. Atherosclerosis usually occurs in arteries rather than in veins. This is because the blood in the arteries flows fast under relatively high pressure, which puts more strain on the endothelial lining of  the vessels and can cause small areas of  damage. In the veins, the pressure is lower so damage to the endothelium is much less likely.cardiovascular diseases\n31%\n27%9%33%communicable (infectious)\ndiseases, childbirth andnutritional conditions \ninjuries\nall other causes\ncardiovascular diseases\n31%\n27%9%33%communicable (infectious)\ndiseases, childbirth andnutritional conditions \ninjuries\nall other causes\n\u25b2 fig A  T his WHO data from 2017 \nshows cardiovascular disease is the biggest single cause of death around the world.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that damage to the \nendothelium occurs first and this is often caused by high blood pressure, often as a result of smoking.\nEXAM HINT\nLearn the stages of the development of atherosclerosis: damage to the endothelium of the arteries \u2192 inflammatory response \u2192 accumulation of cholesterol \u2192 atheroma \u2192 fibrous tissue\/calcium salts \u2192 plaque \u2192 narrowing\/loss of elasticity of the artery.1.11 1.10\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

This means that they're all identical in structure.2) As you know, antibodies are very specific because their binding sites have a unique tertiary structure (see p.44) that only one particular antigen will fit into (one with a complementary shape).3) You can make monoclonal antibodies that bind to anything you want, e.g. a cell antigen or other substance, and they will only bind to (target) this molecule.EXAMPLE: Targeting drugs to a particular cell type \u2014 cancer cells1) Different cells in the body have different surface antigens.2) Cancer cells have antigens called tumour markers that are not found on normal body cells.3) Monoclonal antibodies can be made that will bind to the tumour markers.4) You can also attach anti-cancer drugs to the antibodies.5) When the antibodies come into contact with the canccr cells they will bind to the tumour markers.6) This means the drug will only accumulate in the body where there are cancer cells.7) So, the side effects of an antibody-based drug are lower than other drugs because they accumulate near specific cells.monoclonalantibodyantigen binding siteanti-cancer drugdrug attached to antibodyantibody binds to tumour markers on cancer cellcell-surface antigen\/\\----------------------------No0No------------------------------------------------------------\u2014L\nnormal body cell tumour marker cancer cellEXAMPLE: Targeting a particular substance for medical diagnosis \u2014 pregnancy testingPregnancy tests detect the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) that's found in the urine of pregnant women:1) The application area contains antibodies for hCG bound to a coloured bead (blue).2) When urine is applied to the application area any hCG will bind to the antibody on the beads, forming an antigen-antibody complex.3) The urine moves up the stick to the test strip, carrying any beads with it.4) The test strip contains antibodies to hCG that are stuck in place (immobilised).5) If there is hCG present the test strip turns blue because the immobilised antibody binds to any hCG \u2014 concentrating the hCG-antibody complex with the blue beads attached.If no hCG is present, the beads will pass through the test area without binding to anything, and so it won't go blue.coloured bead antibody \u00a9 ^ to hCGhCG\nappflow of liquidIimmobilised antibody to hCGication areatest stripTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","77":"24Topic 2A \u2014 Cell Structure and DivisionEukaryotic Cells and OrganellesThere are two types of cell \u2014 prokaryotic and eukaryotic.

This helps them to survive in their environment...Plants Need to Respond to Stimuli TooFlowering plants, like animals, increase their chances of survival by responding to changes in their environment, e.g:\u2022 They sense the direction of light and grow towards it to maximise light absorption for photosynthesis.\u2022 They can sense gravity, so their roots and shoots grow in the right direction.\u2022 Climbing plants have a sense of touch, so they can find things to climb up and reach the sunlight.A Tropism is a Plant\u2019s Growth Response to an External Stimulus1) A tropism is the response of a plant to a directional stimulus (a stimulus coming from a particular direction).2) Plants respond to stimuli by regulating their growth.3) A positive tropism is growth towards the stimulus.4) A negative tropism is growth away from the stimulus.Phototropism is the growth of a plant in response to light. Shoots are positively phototropic and grow towards light. Roots are negatively phototropic and grow away from light.ShootsRootsGravitropism is the growth of a plant in response to gravity. Shoots are negatively gravitropic and grow upwards.Roots are positively gravitropic and grow downwards.Responses are Brought About by Growth FactorsThe men's gymnastics team were negatively gravitropic.1) Plants respond to directional stimuli using specific growth factors\u2014 these are hormone-like chemicals that speed up or slow down plant growth.2) Growth factors are produced in the growing regions of the plant (e.g. shoot tips, leaves) and they move to where they're needed in the other parts of the plant.3) Growth factors called auxins stimulate the growth of shoots by cell elongation\u2014 this is where cell walls become loose and stretchy, so the cells get longer.4) High concentrations of auxins inhibit growth in roots though.Indoleacetic Acid (IAA) is an Important Auxin1) Indoleacetic acid (IAA) is an important auxin that's produced in the tips of shoots in flowering plants.2) IAA is moved around the plant to control tropisms \u2014 it moves by diffusion and active transport over short distances, and via the phloem over long distances.3) This results in different parts of the plant having different concentrations of IAA.The uneven distribution of IAA means there's uneven growth of the plant, e.g:Phototropism \u2014 IAA moves to the more shaded parts of the shoots and roots,so there's uneven growth.shootIAA concentration increases on the shaded side \u2014 cells elongate and the shoot bends towards the lightIAA concentration increases V3on the shaded side \u2014 growth is inhibited so the root bends away from the lightGravitropism \u2014 IAA moves to the underside of shoots and roots, so there's uneven growth.s^00^ IAA concentration IAA concentration increases increases on the lower on the lower side \u2014 growth side \u2014 cells elongate so is inhibited so the root the shoot grows upwards grows downwards-------rootTopic 6 A \u2014 Stimuli and Responses\n","79":"What do businesses do?\nBusinesses identify the needs of consumers or other fi rms. \nTh e y  t h e n  p u r c h a s e  r e s o u r c e s \u00a0\u2013 or factors of production \u00a0\u2013 in \norder to produce goods and services that satisfy these needs, \nusually with the aim of making a pro fi t.

When gametes from two parents fuse together, the alleles they contain form the genotype of the offspring produced. At each locus, the genotype can be homozygous or heterozygous.Genetic diagrams can be used to predict the genotypes and phenotypes of the offspring produced if two parents are crossed (bred). You need to know how to use genetic diagrams to interpret or predict the results of various crosses, including monohybrid crosses. Monohybrid inheritance is the inheritance of a characteristic controlled by a single gene. Monohybrid crosses show the likelihood of the different alleles of that gene (and so different versions of the characteristic) being inherited by offspring of certain parents.

Stem cells could be used to grow organs for those people awaiting transplants.\u2022 They could improve the quality of life for many people \u2014 e.g. stem cells could be used to replace damaged cells in the eyes of people who are blind.Human Stem Cells Can Come from Adult Tissue or EmbryosTo use stem cells scientists have to get them from somewhere. There are three main potential sources of human stem cells:(5Adult Stem Cells1) These are obtained from the body tissues of an adult.For example, adult stem cells are found in bone marrow.2) They can be obtained in a relatively simple operation \u2014 with very little risk involved, but quite a lot of discomfort.3) Adult stem cells aren't as flexible as embryonic stem cells \u2014 they can only specialise into a limited range of cells, not all body cell types (they're multipotent).<\u00a3Embryonic Stem Cells1) These are obtained from embryos at an early stage of development.2) Embryos are created in a laboratory using in vitro fertilisation (IVF) \u2014 egg cells are fertilised by sperm outside the womb.3) Once the embryos are approximately 4 to 5 days old, stem cells are removed from them and the rest of the embryo is destroyed.4) Embryonic stem cells can divide an unlimited number of times and develop into all types of body cells (they're pluripotent).(2Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPS Cells)x\\l1 l M ' M I) | \/ | , | | |l, , , , (|- Inscription factors are - r proteins that control whether =- \u00b0r not genes are transcribed ~'\/a see Pa9e 190 for more Z \/n f'11 ii 11 \/ , \/111 M , M)Xs\"1) iPS cells are created by scientists in the lab. The process involves 'reprogramming' specialised adult body cells so that they become pluripotent.2) The adult cells are made to express a series of transcription factors that are normally associated with pluripotent stem cells. The transcription factors cause the adult body cells to express genes that are associated with pluripotency.3) One of the ways that these transcription factors can be introduced to the adult cells is by infecting them with a specially-modified virus. The virus has the genes coding for the transcription factors within its DNA. When the virus infects the adult cell, these genes are passed into the adult cell's DNA, meaning that the cell is able to produce the transcription factors.4) Induced pluripotent stem cells could become really useful in research and medicine in the future\u2014 see next page. At the moment though, more research into how similar they actually are to true pluripotent embryonic stem cells is needed before they can be properly utilised.Topic 8A \u2014 Mutations and Gene Expression\n","83":"150Control of Blood Glucose ConcentrationHomeostasis doesn't always work. One example of this is diabetes...Diabetes Occurs when Blood Glucose Concentration is Not ControlledDiabetes mellitus is a condition where blood glucose concentration can't be controlled properly. There are two types:1) In Type I diabetes, the immune system attacks the (3 cells in the islets of Langerhans so they can't produce any insulin. No one knows exactly what causes the immune system to do this.Scientists have found that some people have a genetic predisposition to developing Type I diabetes. They also think that the disease may be triggered by a viral infection.2) After eating, the blood glucose level rises and stays high \u2014 this is called hyperglycaemia and can result in death if left untreated. The kidneys can't reabsorb all this glucose, so some of it's excreted in the urine.3) Type 1 diabetes is treated with insulin therapy. Most people with Type I diabetes need regular insulin injections throughout the day, but some people use an insulin pump to deliver insulin continuously instead. Insulin therapy has to be carefully controlled because too much insulin can produce a dangerous drop in blood glucose levels \u2014 this is called hypoglycaemia.4) Eating regularly and controlling simple carbohydrate intake (intake of sugars) helps to avoid a sudden rise in glucose.1) Type II diabetes is usually acquired later in life than Type I. It is often linked with obesity and is more likely in people with a family history of the condition. Other risk factors include lack of exercise, age and poor diet.2) It occurs when the |3 cells don't produce enough insulin or when the body's cells don't respond properly to insulin. Cells don't respond properly because the insulin receptors on their membranes don't work properly, so the cells don't take up enough glucose. This means the blood glucose concentration is higher than normal.3) It can be treated by eating a healthy, balanced diet, losing weight (if necessary) and regular exercise. Glucose-lowering medication can be taken if diet and exercise can't control it. Eventually, insulin injections may be needed.Type II Diabetes is a Growing Health Problem1) Type II diabetes is becoming increasingly common in the UK. This has been linked to increasing levels of obesity, a move towards more unhealthy diets and low levels of physical activity.2) Type II diabetes can cause additional health problems, including visual impairment and kidney failure, so health advisors are understandably keen to educate people about the risks and reduce the incidenceof the disease. Some people also think the food industry has a role to play in tackling the problem.3) You need to understand the various responses to the increase in Type II diabetes and be able to evaluate them.To reduce the risk of developing Type II diabetes, health advisors recommend that people:\u2022 eat a diet that's low in fat, sugar and salt, with plenty of whole grains, fruit and vegetables,\u2022 take regular exercise,\u2022 lose weight if necessary.Campaigns like the NHS's 'Change4Life', aim to educate people on how to have a healthier diet and lifestyle, and so reduce their risk of developing conditions like Type II diabetes.Health advisors have also challenged the food industry to reduce the advertising of junk food (particularly to children), to improve the nutritional value of their products, and to use clearer labelling on products \u2014 allowing consumers to make healthier choices about what to buy.w 1111111111 u h 111 ii \\ 111 ii 111111 \\ \\ h 111,In response to criticism, some food companies have z Some people believe that diet varieties are not zattempted to make their products more healthy, e.g. 5 as 300^ ^or health as they are claimed to be, z.. r ,, 1 . 1 - e.q. there is some evidence to suqaest that\u2022 using sugar alternatives to sweeten tood\/drinks, z Jr \u0000 , . , ,. . ,. z 00 ^ artificial sweeteners are linked to weight gain. ^\u2022 reducing the sugar, fat and salt content of products. 111111 w 11 n n 1 u 1111111111 w 111111 uHowever, there is pressure on companies to increase profits.

Infectious diseases can be really nasty, but luckily there's an army of cells in the body that helps lo protect us \u2014 the immune system.Foreign Antigens Trigger an Immune ResponseAntigens are molecules (usually proteins) that can generate an immune response when clctected by the body.They arc usually found on the surface of cells and are used by the immune system to identify: pathogens (organisms that cause disease), abnormal body cells (e.g. cancerous or pathogen-infected cells, which have abnormal antigens on their surface), toxins and cells from other individuals of the same species (e.g. organ transplants).There are four main stages in the immune response:(T) Phagocytes Engulf PathogensA phagocyte (e.g. a macrophage) is a type of white blood cell that carries out phagocytosis (engulfment of pathogens). They're found in the blood and in tissues and are the first cells to respond to an immune system trigger inside the body. Here's how they work:1) A phagocyte recognises the foreign antigens on a pathogen.2) The cytoplasm of the phagocyte moves round the pathogen, engulfing it.3) The pathogen is now contained in a phagocytic vacuole (a bubble) in the cytoplasm of the phagocyte.4) A lysosome (an organelle that contain enzymes called lysozymes) fuses with the phagocytic vacuole. The lysozymes break down the pathogen.5) The phagocyte then presents the pathogen's antigens \u2014 it sticks the antigens on its surface to activate other immune system cells.nucleuscytoplasmlysosomeantigens on surface ofphagocyte engulfs the pathogenlysosome fuses with phagocytic vacuole(2) Phagocytes Activate T-cellsA T-cell {also called a T-lymphocyte) is another type of white blood cell. It has receptor proteins on its surface that bind to complementary antigens presented to it by phagocytes. This activates the T-cell. Different types of T-cells respond in different ways. For example, helper T-cells {TH cells) release chemical signals that activate and stimulate phagocytes and cytotoxic T-cells (Tc cells), which kill abnormal and foreign cells B-cells, which secrete antibodies (see below).Th cells also activate(3) T-cells Activate B-cells, Which Divide into Plasma CellsB-cells (also called B-lymphocytes) are also a type of white blood cell. They're covered with antibodies \u2014 proteins that bind antigens to form an antigen-antibody complex. Each B-cell has a different shaped antibody on its membrane, so different ones bind to different shaped antigens.1) When the antibody on the surface of a B-cell meets a complementary shaped antigen, it binds to it.2) This, together with substances released from helper T-cells, activates the B-cell. This process is called clonal selection.3) The activated B-cell divides into plasma cells.(V) Plasma Cells Make More Antibodies to a Specific AntigenPlasma cells are identical to the B-cell (they're clones). They secrete loads of antibodies specific to the antigen. These are called monoclonal antibodies. They bind to the antigens on the surface of the pathogen to form lots of antigen-antibody complexes,An antibody has two binding sites, so can bind to two pathogens at the same time. This means that pathogens become clumped together \u2014 this is called agglutination. Phagocytes then bind to the antibodies and phagocytose many pathogens at once. This process leads to the destruction of pathogens carrying this antigen in the body.variableregions(orange)constan regions (blue)heavychainAntibodies are proteins \u2014 they're made up of chains of amino acids.The specificity of an antibody depends on its variable regions, which form the antigen binding sites. Each antibody has a variable region with a unique tertiary structure {due to different amino acid sequences) that's complementary to one specific antigen. All antibodies have the same constant regions.Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","86":"36Topic 2B \u2014 Cell MembranesCell Membrane StructureYou might remember a bit about cell membranes from p. 25. Well now it's time to delve a little deeper...Membranes Control What Passes Through ThemAll cells are surrounded by membranes. In eukaryotic cells,many of the organelles are surrounded by membranes too.1)2)Cell-surface membranes surround cells. They are a barrier between the cell and its environment, controlling which substances enter and leave the cell. They're partially permeable \u2014 they let some molecules through but not others. Substances can move across the cell-surface membrane by diffusion, osmosis or active transport (see pages 38-43).The membranes around organelles divide the cell into different compartments \u2014 they act as a barrier between the organelle and the cytoplasm. They are also partially permeable and control what substances enter and leave the organelle.Cell Membranes have a Fluid Mosaic\u2019 StructurePartially permeable membranes can be useful at sea.The basic structure of all cell membranes is pretty much the same. They're composed of lipids (mainly phospholipids \u2014 see page 7), proteins and carbohydrates (attached to proteins or lipids).1)2)3)4)5)In 1972, the fluid mosaic model was suggested to describe the arrangement of molecules in the membrane.

This is particularly important for cells that aren't supported by other cells, e.g. red blood cells, which float free in the blood.Topic 2B \u2014 Cell Membranes\n","87":"140Synaptic TransmissionNeurotransmitters Can be Excitatory, Inhibitory or Both1) Excitatory neurotransmitters depolarise the postsynaptic membrane, making it fire an action potential if the threshold is reached. E.g. acetylcholine is an excitatory neurotransmitter at cholinergic synapses in the CNS \u2014 it binds to cholinergic receptors to cause an action potential in the postsynaptic membrane \u2014 and at neuromuscular junctions (see below).2) Inhibitory neurotransmitters hyperpolarise the postsynaptic membrane (make the potential difference more negative), preventing it from firing an action potential. E.g. acetylcholine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter at cholinergic synapses in the heart. When it binds to receptors here, it can cause potassium ion channels to open on the postsynaptic membrane, hyperpolarising it.Summation at Synapses Finely Tunes the Nervous ResponseIf a stimulus is weak, only a small amount of neurotransmitter will be released from a neurone into the synaptic cleft. This might not be enough to excite the postsynaptic membrane to the threshold level and stimulate an action potential. Summation is where the effect of neurotransmitter released from many neurones (or one neurone that's stimulated a lot in a short period of time) is added together. There are two types of summation:Spatial summation1)2)3)Temporal summation_ + + + +Temporal summation is where two or more nerve impulses arrive in quick 4succession from the same presynaptic neurone.

Now you've enjoyed that poem, it's time to concentrate. I hope you like remembering reactions involved in respiration, because these pages have several.There are Two Types of Respiration1) The two types of respiration are aerobic (requires oxygen) and anaerobic (doesn't require oxygen).2) Both produce ATP (see p. 104), although anaerobic respiration produces less.3) Both start with the process of glycolysis (see below). The stages after glycolysis differ.Glycolysis Makes Pyruvate from Glucose1) Glycolysis involves splitting one molecule of glucose (with 6 carbons \u2014 6C) into two smaller molecules of pyruvate (3C).2) The process happens in the cytoplasm of cells.3) Glycolysis is the first stage of both aerobic and anaerobic respiration and doesn't need oxygen to take place \u2014 so it's an anaerobic process.There are Two Stages in Glycolysis Phosphorylation and OxidationFirst, ATP is used to phosphorylate glucose to triose phosphate. Overall there's a net gain of 2 ATP and 2 reduced NAD.Stage One \u2014 Phosphorylation]1) Glucose is phosphorylated using a phosphate from a molecule of ATP.This creates 1 molecule of glucose phosphate and 1 molecule of ADP.2) ATP is then used to add another phosphate, forming hexose bisphosphate.3) Hexose bisphosphate is then split into 2 molecules of triose phosphate.1) Triose phosphate is oxidised(loses hydrogen), forming 2 molecules of pyruvate.2) NAD collects the hydrogen ions, forming 2 reduced NAD.3) 4 ATP are produced, but 2 were used up in stage one, so there's a net gain of 2 ATP.ATPADPThen triose phosphate is oxidised, releasing ATP.glucoseDHnumber of carbons in the moleculeglucose phosphate |6C|ATPADPZ)Hhexose bisphosphate12 x triose phosphate4ATP2 NAD\n2 reduced NADIn aerobic respiration...1) The two molecules of reduced NAD go to oxidative phosphorylation \u2014 see page 116.2) The two pyruvate molecules are actively transported intothe matrix of the mitochondria for the link reaction (see the next page).In Anaerobic Respiration Pyruvate is Converted to Ethanol or LactateIn anaerobic respiration, the pyruvate produced in glycolysis is converted into ethanol (in plants and yeast) or lactate (in animal cells and some bacteria) using reduced NAD:Alcoholic Fermentation reducedCO.- NAD NADLactate Fermentation reduced NAD NADpyruvateethanalUethanolpyruvateylactate (lactic acid)The production of ethanol or lactate regenerates oxidised NAD.

These pages cover the facts behind the replication mechanism, as well as some of the history behind its discovery. This stuff is really clever. Honest.DNA Replicates by Semi-Conservative ReplicationDNA copies itself before cell division (see p. 32) so that each new cell has the full amount of DNA.The method is called semi-conservative replication because half of the strands in each new DNA moleculeare from the original DNA molecule. This means that there's genetic continuity between generations of cells (i.e. the cells produced by cell division inherit their genes from their parent cells).1)The enzyme DNA helicase breaks the hydrogen bondsbetween bases on the two polynucleotide DNA strands. This makes the helix unwind to form two single strands.Breaks the hydrogen bonds2)Each original single strand acts as a template for a new strand.

In a DNA helix, the strands run in opposite directions \u2014 they're antiparallel.The active site of DNA polymerase is only complementary to the 3' endof the newly forming DNA strand \u2014 so the enzyme can only add nucleotides to the new strand at the 3' end.This means that the new strand is made in a 5' to 3' direction and that 3'- DNA polymerase moves down the template strand in a 3' to 5' direction. Because the strands in the double-helix are antiparallel, the DNA polymerase working on one of the template strands moves in the opposite direction to the DNA polymerase working on the other template strand.DNA Polymerase\nDNA PolymeraseTopic 1B \u2014 More Biological Molecules\n","90":"6LipidsLipids are really nice.

This means that the NnRr parent produced mostly NR and nr gametes. Some Nr and nR gametes were still made due to crossing over, but there were fewer Nnrr and nnRr offspring overall. As a result, a higher proportion of the offspring have their parents' phenotypes.An Epistatic Gene Masks the Expression of Another Gene1) Many different genes can control the same characteristic \u2014 they interact to form the phenotype.2) This can be because the allele of one gene masks (blocks) the expression of the alleles of other genes\u2014 this is called epistasis.Example 1In humans a widow's peak (see picture) is controlled by one gene and baldness by others. If you have the alleles that code for baldness, it doesn't matter whether you have the allele for a widow's peak or not, as you have no hair. The baldness genes are epistatic to the widow's peak gene, as the baldness genes mask the expression of the widow's peak gene.Example 2Flower pigment in a plant is controlled by two genes. Gene 1 codes for a yellow pigment (Y is the dominant yellow allele) and gene 2 codes for an enzyme that turns the yellow pigment orange (R is the dominant orange allele). If you don't have the Y allele it won't matter if you have the R allele or not as the flower will be colourless.

Frequent press releases giving details of \nundesirable company activity and coverage of \u2018direct \naction\u2019 events, such as meetings, demonstrations and \nconsumer boycotts will help to constantly keep the \ncampaign in the public eye.

Humans need things like money and the newest mobile phone, but enzymes are quite content with the right temperature and pH.Temperature has a Big Influence on Enzyme ActivityLike any chemical reaction, the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction increases when the temperature's increased. More heat means more kinetic energy, so molecules move faster. This makes the enzymes more likely to collide with the substrate molecules. The energy of these collisions also increases, which means each collision is more likely to result in a reaction. But, if the temperature gets too high, the reaction stops.1) The rise in temperature makes the enzyme's molecules vibrate more.2) If the temperature goes above a certain level, this vibration breaks some of the bonds that hold the enzyme in shape.3) The active site changes shape and the enzyme and substrate no longer fit together.4) At this point, the enzyme is denatured\u2014 it no longer functions as a catalyst.optimum temperature11 nn 11,TemperaturepH Also Affects Enzyme ActivityO\u2019\" \" I M I | | | ,, , ,~ Every enzyme has an enzyme is r optimum temperature = denatured r For most human enzymes - r ,t,saro^37\u00b0C but some r _ enzymes, like those used in ~- biological washing powders, ~ ~ can work well at 60 \u00b0C ~All enzymes have an optimum pH value. Most human enzymes work best at pH 7 (neutral), but there are exceptions. Pepsin, for example, works best at acidic pH 2, which is useful because it's found in the stomach. Above and below the optimum pH, the H+ and OH ions found in acids and alkalis can mess up the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds that hold the enzyme's tertiary structure in place. This makes the active site change shape, so the enzyme is denatured.Enzyme Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction1) The more enzyme molecules there are in a solution,the more likely a substrate molecule is to collide with one and form an enzyme-substrate complex. So increasing the concentration of the enzyme increases the rate of reaction.2) But, if the amount of substrate is limited, there comes a point when there's more than enough enzyme molecules to deal with all the available substrate, so adding more enzyme has no further effect.steady increase as more active sites are available \\if substrate amount is limited, an increase in enzyme concentration eventually has no further effectEnzyme ConcentrationSubstrate Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction Up to a Pointsteady increase as more substrate molecules are availableall active sites used \u2014 increase in substrate concentration has no further effectSubstrate Concentration1) The higher the substrate concentration, the faster the reaction \u2014 more substrate molecules means a collision between substrate and enzyme is more likely and so more active sites will be used. This is only true up until a 'saturation' point though. After that, there are so many substrate molecules that the enzymes have about as much as they can cope with(all the active sites are full), and adding more makes no difference.2) Substrate concentration decreases with time during a reaction (unless more substrate is added to the reaction mixture), so if no other variables are changed, the rate of reaction will decrease over time too.

Half these chromosomes are from the father (the sperm) and half are from the mother (the egg).5) During sexual reproduction, any sperm can fertilise any egg \u0000 produces zygotes with different combinations of chromosomes to both parents. This mixing of genetic materialin sexual reproduction increases genetic diversity within a species (there's more on genetic diversity on page 92).2 nfertilisation is random. Random fertilisationGametes are Formed by MeiosisMeiosis is a type of cell division. It takes place in the reproductive organs. Cells that divide by meiosis are diploid to start with, but the cells that are formed from meiosis are haploid \u2014 the chromosome number halves. Without meiosis, you'd get double the number of chromosomes when the gametes fused. Not good.1) Before meiosis starts, the DNA unravels and replicates so there are two copies of each chromosome, called chromatids.2) The DNA condenses to form double-armed chromosomes, each made from two sister chromatids. The sister chromatids are joined in the middle by a centromere.3) Meiosis I (first division) \u2014 the chromosomes arrange themselves into homologous pairs4) These homologous pairs are then separated, halving the chromosome number.5) Meiosis II (second division) \u2014 the pairs of sister chromatids that make up each chromosome are separated (the centromere is divided).6) Four haploid cells (gametes) that are genetically different from each other are producedIn the exams, you might need to spot when meiosis happens in an organism with a life cycle you haven't seen before, e.g. an insect or plant. Just remember (hat in any organism, meiosis is needed for sexual reproduction because it produces daughter cells (gametes) with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell.You might also be told how many chromosomes are in a parent cell, then asked to complete diagrams showing how many chromosomes will be in the daughter cells after the first and second divisions of meiosis. Remember that the chromosome number is halved during the first division.A Note About Homologous Pairs: Humans have 46 chromosomes in total \u2014 23 pairs. One chromosome in each pair came from mum and one from dad, e.g. there are two number 1's (one from mum and one from dad), two number 2s etc. The chromosomes that make up each pair are the same size and have the same genes. although they could have different versions of those genes (called alleles).

This may lead to a higher incidence of genetic disease.3) The founder effect can occur as a result of migration leading to geographical separation or if a newcolony is separated from the original population for another reason, such as religion.Example \u2014The AmishThe Amish population of North America are all descended from a small number of Swiss who migrated there. The population shows little genetic diversity. They have remained isolated from the surrounding population due to their religious beliefs, so few new alleles have been introduced.

If it wasn't for pies, my favourite jeans would still fit.Mitosis is Cell Division that Produces Genetically Identical CellsThere are two types of cell division in eukaryotes \u2014 mitosis and meiosis (see pages 88-89 for more on meiosis).1) In mitosis a parent cell divides to produce two genetically identical daughter cells(they contain an exact copy of the DNA of the parent cell).2) Mitosis is needed for the growth of multicellular organisms (like us) and for repairing damaged tissues.3) In multicellular organisms, not all cells keep their ability to divide (see next page). The ones that do, follow a cell cycle. Mitosis is part of the cell cycle:The cell cycle consists of a period of cell growth and DNA replication called interphase. Mitosis happens after that. Interphase (cell growth) is subdivided into three separate growth stages.These are called G,, S and G,.GAP PHASE 2cell keeps growing and proteins needed for cell division are madeSYNTHESIScell replicates its DNA,ready to divide by mitosisMITOSIS (the cycle starts and ends here)GAP PHASE 1 cell grows and new organelles and proteins are madeMitosis has Four Division StagesMitosis is really one continuous process, but it's described as a series of division stages \u2014 prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. Interphase comes before mitosis in the cell cycle.Interphase \u2014 The cell carries out normal functions, but also prepares to divide. The cell's DNA is unravelled and replicated, to double its genetic content. The organelles are also replicated so it has spare ones, and its ATP content is increased (ATP provides the energy needed for cell division).Prophase \u2014 The chromosomes. condense, getting shorter and fatter. Tiny bundles of protein called centrioles start moving to opposite ends of the cell, forming a network of protein fibres across it called the spindle. The nuclear envelope (the membrane around the nucleus) breaks down and chromosomes lie free in the cytoplasm.Centromere%CentromereAs mitosis begins, the chromosomes are made of two strands joined in the middle by a centromere. One chromatid The separate strands are called chromatids. , , ^There are two strands because chromatids each chromosome has already made an identical copy of itself during interphase.When mitosis is over, the chromatids end up as one-strand chromosomes in the daughter cells.2)3)Metaphase \u2014 The chromosomes (each with two chromatids) line up along the middle of the cell and become attached to the spindle by their centromere.Anaphase \u2014The centromeres divide, separating each pair of sister chromatids. The spindles contract, pulling chromatids to opposite poles (ends) of the spindle, centromere first.This makes the chromatids appear v-shaped.Sister chromatids moving to opposite poles of the spindle4)Telophase \u2014 The chromatids reach the opposite poles on the spindle.They uncoil and become long and thin again. They're now called chromosomes again. A nuclear envelope forms around each group of chromosomes, so there are now two nuclei.

As it \ncools further, the molecules become more widely spaced. As a result, ice is less dense than water and floats, forming an insulating layer and helping to prevent the water underneath it from freezing. It also melts quickly because, being at the top, it is exposed to the sun. It is very unusual for the solid form of  a substance to be less dense than the liquid form. This unusual property enables organisms to live in water, even in countries where it gets cold enough to freeze in winter.\n \u2022W\nater is slow to absorb and release heat \u2013 it has a high specific \nheat capacity.

Surface tension is very important in plant transport systems, and also affects life at the surface of  ponds, lakes and other water masses (see fig I).\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that co means two similar things together, as in cohabit, \nand ad means two different things together.\n\u25b2 fig I Without surface tension, a r aft spider like this could not move \nacross the water and hunt.EXAM HINT\nAll these properties are a result of dipoles and hydrogen bonding between water molecules.

The arteries and veins are like the large roads carrying heavy traffic while the narrow town streets and tracks are represented by the vast area of  branching and spreading capillaries called the capillary network. In the capillary network, substances carried by the blood are exchanged with cells in the same way that products are transported from factories, oil refineries or farms and distributed into shops and homes. The structures of  the different types of  blood vessel closely reflect their functions in your body.\nARTERIES\nArteries carry blood away from your heart towards the cells of  your body. The structure of  an artery is shown in fig A. Almost all arteries carry oxygenated blood. The exceptions are:\n \u2022the pulmonar\ny artery \u2013 carrying deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs\n \u2022the umbilical ar\ntery \u2013 during pregnancy, this carries deoxygenated blood from the fetus to  \nthe placenta.\nThe arteries leaving the heart branch off  in every direction, and the diameter of  the lumen, the central space inside the blood vessel, gets smaller the further away it is from the heart. The very smallest branches of  the arterial system, furthest from the heart, are the arterioles. \nThe middle layers of\nthe artery wall containelastic \ufb01bres and smoothmuscle; arteries nearestthe heart have more elastic\ufb01bres, those further fromthe heart have a greaterproportion of muscle tissue.\nelastic \ufb01bres andsmooth musclelumentough outerlayer\nendotheliumexternal layerof tough tissue\nThe endothelium forms asmooth lining which allows theeasiest possible \ufb02ow of blood.Lumen is small whenartery unstretched by\ufb02ow of blood from heart.\n\u25b2 fig A  T he structure of an artery means it is adapted to cope with the surging of the blood as the heart pumps.\nBlood is pumped out from the heart in a regular rhythm, about 70 times a minute. Each heartbeat \nsends a high-pressure flow of  blood into the arteries. The major arteries close to the heart must withstand these pressure surges. Their walls contain a lot of  elastic fibres, so they can stretch to accommodate the greater volume of  blood without being damaged (see fig B). Between surges, the elastic fibres return to their original length, squeezing the blood to move it along in a continuous flow. The pulse you can feel in an artery is the effect of  the surge each time the heart beats. The blood pressure in all arteries is relatively high, but it falls in arteries further away from the heart. These are known as the peripheral arteries. LEARNING TIP\nRemember that all arteries carry \nblood away from the heart, so they have thick walls and lots of collagen to withstand the high pressure.\nEXAM HINT\nYou will study the structure and the function of the types of blood vessel separately.

As the bacteria reproduced, they took up nitrogen from the broth to help make nucleotides for new DNA. So the nitrogen gradually became part of the bacteria's DNA.2) A sample of DNA was taken from each batch of bacteria, and spun in a centrifuge. The DNA from the heavy nitrogen bacteria settled lower down the centrifuge tube than the DNA from the light nitrogen bacteria \u2014 because it's heavier.3) Then the bacteria grown in the heavy nitrogen broth were taken out and put in a broth containing only light nitrogen. The bacteria were left for one round of DNA replication, and then another DNA sample was taken out and spun in the centrifuge.4) If replication was conservative, the original heavy DNA, which would still be together, would settle at the bottom and the new light DNA would settle at the top.5) If replication was semi-conservative, the new bacterial DNA molecules would contain one strand of the old DNA containing heavy nitrogen and one strand of new DNA containing light nitrogen. So the DNA would settle out between where the light nitrogen DNA settled out and where the heavy nitrogen DNA settled out.6) As it turned out, the DNA settled out in the middle, showing that the DNA molecules contained a mixture of heavy and light nitrogen. The bacterial DNA had replicated semi-conservatively in the light nitrogen.Once Meselson and Stahl had confirmed that DNA replication in bacteria was semi-conservative, other scientists carried out experiments to show that it was the universal method for DNA replication in all living things.Practice QuestionsQ1 What is the role of DNA helicase in DNA replication?Q2 What's the key difference between the conservative and semi-conservative theories of DNA replication?Exam QuestionQ1 Dcscribc the process of semi-conservative DNA replication.

Both aerobic and anaerobic respiration in yeast produce C02, so the rate of C02 production gives an indication of the yeast's respiration rate. One way to measure CO, production is by using a gas syringe to collect the CO.,.The methods below show you how to investigate the effects of temperature on yeast respiration.

The gas syringe should be set to zero.Start a stop watch as soon as the bung has been put in the test tube.As the yeast respire, the C02 formed will travel up the tube and into the gas syringe, which is used to measure the volume of C02 released.At regular time intervals (e.g. every minute), record the volume of C02 that is present in the gas syringe.Do this for a set amount of time (e.g. 10 minutes).A control experiment should also be set up at each temperature, where no yeast is present. No C02 should be formed without the yeast. Repeat the experiment three times at each temperature you're investigating.

This contains synaptic vesicles filled with chemicals called neurotransmitters.4) When an action potential reaches the end of a neurone it causes neurotransmitters to be released into the synaptic cleft.They diffuse across to the postsynaptic membrane (the one after the synapse) and bind to specific receptors.5) When neurotransmitters bind to receptors they might trigger an action potential (in a neurone), cause muscle contraction(in a muscle cell), or cause a hormone to be secreted (from a gland cell).6) Because the receptors are only on the postsynaptic membranes, synapses make sure impulses are unidirectional \u2014 the impulse can only travel in one direction.7) Neurotransmitters are removed from the cleft so the response doesn't keep happening, e.g. they're taken backinto the presynaptic neurone or they're broken down by enzymes (and the products are taken into the neurone).8) There are many different neurotransmitters, e.g. acetylcholine (ACh) and noradrenaline.

An action potential on the postsynaptic membrane is generated if the threshold is reached.9) ACh is removed from the synaptic cleft so the response doesn't keep happening.

The potential difference becomes more negative than the resting potential (i.e. less than -70 mV).^ Resting potential \u2014 the ion channels are reset. The sodium-potassium pump returns the membrane to its resting potential and maintains it until the membrane's excited by another stimulus.After an action potential, the neurone cell membrane can't be excited again straight away. This is because the ion channels are recovering and they can't be made to open \u2014 sodium ion channels are closed during repolarisation and potassium ion channels are closed during hyperpolarisation. This period of recovery is called the refractory period.The Action Potential Moves Along the Neurone as a Wave of Depolarisation1) When an action potential happens, some of the sodium ions that enter the neurone diffuse sideways.2) This causes sodium ion channels in the next region of the neurone to open and sodium ions diffuse into that part.3) This causes a wave of depolarisation to travel along the neurone.4) The wave moves away from the parts of the membrane in the refractory period because these parts can't fire anaction potential.refractory refractoryperiodi It's like a Mexican wave _ = travelling through a - = crowd \u2014 sodium ions _ ' rushing inwards causes __ = a wave of activity alongstimulus -+ + +----------------Nt Nlthe membrane. rwave of depolarisationThe Refractory Period Produces Discrete Impulses1) During the refractory period, ion channels are recovering and can't be opened.2) So the refractory period acts as a time delay between one action potential and the next.This means that:\u2022 action potentials don't overlap, but pass along as discrete (separate) impulses.\u2022 there's a limit to the frequency at which the nerve impulses can be transmitted.\u2022 action potentials are unidirectional (they only travel in one direction).Action Potentials have an AII-or-Nothing Nature1) Once the threshold is reached, an action potentialwill always fire with the same change in voltage, cmaiutimnlnc AAAno matter how big the stimulus is. a2) If the threshold isn't reached, an action potential won't fire.

Increasingly, there is general agreement \nthat fi rms must adopt a wider perspective when setting \ntheir objectives and not just be aiming for pro fi ts or \nexpansion. One reason for this is the much greater adverse \npublicity given to business activity that is perceived as \nbeing damaging to stakeholder groups and the wider \nworld. Increasingly, in fl uential pressure groups are forcing \nbusinesses to reconsider their approach to decision-\nmaking. Also, legal changes \u00a0\u2013 at the local, national and \nEU level \u00a0\u2013 have forced businesses to refrain from certain \npractices.

Might businesses be criticised \nfor \u2018jumping on the corporate social responsibility \nbandwagon\u2019 rather than praised for their genuine concern \nfor society and the environment? Conceivably, fi rms are \nbeing ethical or environmentally conscious because they \nhave an objective that Peter Drucker, a famous writer \non management, calls \u2018public responsibility\u2019, because \nthey want to behave in these ways. Many consumer \ngroups and pressure groups are still dubious as to \nwhether these objectives are based on genuinely held \nbeliefs or not.

They're much easier to explain if you describe their structure in four 'levels'. These levels are a protein's primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures.Primary Structure \u2014 this is the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain.Secondary Structure \u2014 the polypeptide chain doesn't remain flat and straight.Hydrogen bonds form between the amino acids in the chain.This makes it automatically coil into an alpha (a) helix or fold into a beta ((3) pleated sheet \u2014 this is the secondary structure.Tertiary Structure \u2014 the coiled or folded chain of amino acids is often coiled and folded further. More bonds form between different parts of the polypeptide chain, including hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds (attractions between negative and positive charges on different parts of the molecule).Disulfide bridges also form whenever two molecules of the amino acid cysteine come close together \u2014 the sulfur atom in one cysteine bonds to the sulfur atom in the other. For proteins made from a single polypeptide chain, the tertiary structure forms their final 3D structure.Quaternary Structure \u2014 some proteins are made of several different polypeptide chains held together by bonds. The quaternary structureis the way these polypeptide chains are assembled together.

These are very small \nvessels that spread throughout the tissues of  the body. The capillary network links the arterioles and the venules. Capillaries branch between cells \u2013 no cell is far from a capillary, so substances can diffuse between cells and the blood quickly. Also, because the diameter of  each individual capillary is small, the blood travels relatively slowly through them, giving more opportunity for diffusion to occur (see fig C). The smallest capillary is no wider than a single red blood cell.\nCapillaries have a very simple structure which is well adapted \nto their function. Their walls are very thin and contain no elastic fibres, smooth muscle or collagen. This helps them fit between individual cells and allows rapid diffusion of  substances between the blood and the cells. The walls consist of  just one very thin cell. Oxygen and other molecules, such as digested food molecules and hormones, quickly diffuse out of  the blood in the capillaries into the nearby body cells, and carbon dioxide and other waste molecules diffuse into the capillaries. Blood entering the capillary network from the arteries is oxygenated.

High light intensity of a certain wavelengthLight is needed to provide the energy for the light-dependent reaction\u2014 the higher the intensity of the light, the more energy it provides.Only certain wavelengths of light are used for photosynthesis.The photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotene only absorb the red and blue light in sunlight.(Green light is reflected, which is why plants look green.)2. Temperature around 25 \u00b0CWavelength \/ nmPhotosynthesis involves enzymes (e.g. ATP synthase, rubisco). If the temperature falls below 10 \u00b0C the enzymes become inactive, but if the temperature is more than 45 \u00b0C they may start to denature.Also, at high temperatures stomata close to avoid losing too much water. This causes photosynthesis to slow down because less C02 enters the leaf when the stomata are closed.3. Carbon dioxide at 0.4%\u2022 Carbon dioxide makes up 0.04% of the gases in the atmosphere.\u2022 Increasing this to 0.4% gives a higher rate of photosynthesis, but any higher and the stomata start to close.Plants also need a constant supply of water \u2014 too little and photosynthesis has to stop but too much and the soil becomes waterlogged (reducing the uptake of minerals such as magnesium, which is needed to make chlorophyll a).Light, Temperature and C02  can all Limit Photosynthesis1) All three of these things need to be at the right level to allow a plant to photosynthesise as quickly as possible.2) If any one of these factors is too low or too high, it will limit photosynthesis (slow it down).Even if the other two factors are at the perfect level, it won't make any difference to the speed of photosynthesis as long as that factor is at the wrong level.3) On a warm, sunny, windless day, it's usually C02 that's the limiting factor, and at night it's the light intensity.4) However, any of these factors could become the limiting factor, depending on the environmental conditions.i\/iCD-PCo-poAlight intensityBetween points A and B, the rate of photosynthesis is limited by the light intensity.

They are an \nintegral part of  all cell membranes and are also used as an energy store. Lipids contain many carbon\u2013\nhydrogen bonds and almost no oxygen. When lipids are oxidised in the respiration process, the bonds are broken and carbon dioxide and water are the final products. This reaction can be used to drive the production of  much ATP (see Sections 1A.3, 2A.2 and 2A.4 and Book 2 Chapter 5A). Lipids, \nespecially triglycerides, store about three times as much energy as the same mass of  carbohydrates. Many plants and animals convert spare food into oils or fats as an energy store to use when needed. For example, the seeds of  plants contain lipids to provide energy for the seedling when it starts to grow, which is why seeds are such an important food source for many animals.\nFATS AND OILS\nFats and oils are important groups of  lipids. Chemically they are very similar, but fats such as butter are solids at room temperature whereas oils such as olive oil are liquids (see fig A). Fats come mainly from animal sources while oils are mainly from plant sources.\nLike carbohydrates, the chemical elements that all lipid molecules contain are carbon, hydrogen and \noxygen. However, lipids contain a much lower proportion of  oxygen than carbohydrates. Fats and oils contain two types of  organic chemical substance, fatty acids and glycerol (propane-1,2,3-triol). These are combined using ester bonds. Glycerol has the chemical formula C\n3H8O3 (see fig B).\nAll fatty acids have a long hydrocarbon chain \u2013 a folded backbone of  carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms attached, and a carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) at one end. Living tissues contain more than 70 different types of  fatty acid. Fatty acids vary in two ways:\n \u2022the length of\n the carbon chain can differ (but is often 15\u201317 carbon atoms long)\n \u2022the f\natty acid may be a saturated fatty acid or an unsaturated fatty acid.\nIn a saturated fatty acid, each carbon atom is joined to the one next to it by a single covalent bond. A common example is stearic acid (see fig C). In an unsaturated fatty acid, the carbon chains have one or more double covalent bonds between carbon atoms in them. A monounsaturated fatty acid has one carbon\u2013carbon double bond and a polyunsaturated fatty acid has more than one carbon\u2013carbon double bond (see fig\u00a0D). Linoleic acid is an example of  a polyunsaturated fatty acid.

These cells require a supply of  chemical substances such as glucose and oxygen for cellular respiration. These must be transported from outside a large organism into the cells. Respiration supplies energy for the other reactions of  life, but it also produces the toxic waste product carbon dioxide. This and other waste products need to be removed from the cells before they cause damage to them. \nLarge multicellular organisms have internal transport systems that \ncarry substances to every cell in the body. These systems deliver oxygen and nutrients and remove waste so that cells can carry out their functions efficiently. In large complex animals such as humans, chemicals made in a cell in one part of  the body \u2013 such as a hormone like insulin or adrenaline \u2013 may influence a different type of  cell elsewhere in the body. So substances made internally need to be moved around the body as well.\nIn many animals, including all the vertebrates, this transport \nsystem is the heart and circulatory system and the fluid that flows through it. This is an example of  a mass transport system \u2013 substances are transported in the flow of  a fluid with a mechanism for moving it around the body. All large complex organisms have some form of  mass transport system which overcomes the limits of  diffusion between the internal and external environments. Substances are delivered over short distances from the mass transport system to individual cells deep in the body by processes such as diffusion, osmosis and active transport.\nFEATURES OF MASS TRANSPORT SYSTEMS\nMass transport systems are very effective for moving substances around the body. Most mass transport systems have certain features which are the same. They have:\n \u2022e\nxchange surfaces to get materials into and out of  the transport \nsystem\n \u2022a system of\n vessels that carry substances \u2013 these are usually \ntubes, sometimes following a very specific route, sometimes widespread and branching\n \u2022a w\nay of  making sure that substances are moved in the right \ndirection (e.g. nutrients in and waste out)\n \u2022a w\nay of  moving materials fast enough to supply the needs \nof  the organism \u2013 this may involve mechanical methods such as the pumping of  the heart or ways of  maintaining a concentration gradient so that substances move quickly from one place to another (e.g. using active transport)\n \u2022a suita\nble transport medium (e.g. fluid)\n \u2022in man\ny cases, a way of  adapting the rate of  transport to the \nneeds of  the organism.\nCIRCULATION SYSTEMS\nMany animals have a circulatory system in which a heart pumps blood around the body. Insects have an open circulatory system with the blood circulating in large open spaces. However, most larger animals, including mammals, have a closed circulatory system with the blood contained within tubes. The blood makes a continuous journey out to the most distant parts of  the body and back to the heart.\nLEARNING TIP\nThe main advantages of a closed system are:\n\u2022 the pressure can be increased to make the blood flow more quickly\n\u2022 the flow can be directed more precisely to the organs that need \nmost oxygen and nutrients.\nAnimals such as fish have a single circulation system (see fig \nC). The heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the gills, the organs \nof  gas exchange where the blood takes in oxygen (becomes oxygenated) and gives up carbon dioxide at the same time. The blood then travels on around the rest of  the body of  the fish, giving up oxygen to the body cells before returning to the\u00a0heart.\ngill\ncapillarie saorta\nventricle atriumsystemic\ncapillarie s\n\u25b2 fig C  T he single circulation of a fish  \nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that mass flow is like a stream with all the components \nflowing together.\nBirds and mammals need much more oxygen than fish. Not \nonly do they have to move around without the support of  water, but they also maintain a constant body temperature that may be higher or lower than their surroundings. This takes a lot of  resources, so their cells need plenty of  oxygen and glucose and make waste products that need to be removed quickly. Birds and mammals have evolved the most complex type of  transport system, known as a double circulation because it involves two separate circulation systems. The systemic circulation carries oxygenated blood (oxygen-rich blood) from the heart to the cells of  the body where the oxygen is used. It also carries the deoxygenated blood (blood that has given up its oxygen to the body cells) back to the heart. The pulmonary circulation carries\u00a0deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs to be oxygenated and then carries the oxygenated blood back to the heart (see fig D).\nThe separate circuits of  a double circulatory system ensure that \nthe oxygenated and deoxygenated blood cannot mix, so the tissues receive as much oxygen as possible. Another big advantage is that the fully oxygenated blood can be delivered quickly to the body tissues at high pressure. The blood going through the tiny blood vessels in the lungs is at relatively low pressure, so it does \nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Transfer the root tip into the boiling tube and incubate for about 5 minutes.Use a pipette to rinse the root tip well with cold water. Leave the tip to dry on a paper towel.Place the root tip on a microscope slide and cut 2 mm from the very tip of it.

In science, risk describes the probability that an event will happen. Probability means the chance or likelihood of  the event, calculated mathematically. For example, imagine you have six coloured balls \u2013 red, blue, green, yellow, orange and purple \u2013 in a black cloth bag (see fig A).

Personal perception of  risk is based on a variety of  factors which include: \n \u2022ho\nw familiar you are with the activity \n \u2022ho\nw much you enjoy the activity\n \u2022w\nhether or not you approve of  the activity. \nThe actual mathematical risk may play very little part in developing your personal perception of  risk. People often overestimate the benefits, or minimise the risk, of  behaviour that they want to continue. For example, there is now strong evidence from around the world that obesity is linked to a range of  diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers. However, people like eating and so they still become overweight. On the other hand, they will over-emphasise the risks of  activities if  they want to avoid them or prevent others from doing them. For example, parents over-emphasise the risk of  wandering away to small children, to help make the child behave and stay close.\nIn another example, there is good scientific evidence that smoking affects our risk of  developing \ndiseases such as atherosclerosis, as well as lung cancer. However, knowledge of  the mathematical risk of  an early death if  you smoke cigarettes doesn\u2019t always stop people from smoking.\u25b2 fig A  T he risk, chance or \nprobability that you will pick a blue ball out of the black bag is 1 in 6.

This means that there's a voltage across the membrane. Voltage is also known as potential difference.\u2022 The potential difference when a cell is at rest is called its resting potential. When a stimulus is detected, the cell membrane is excited and becomes more permeable, allowing more ions to move in and out of the cell \u2014 altering the potential difference. The change in potential difference due to a stimulus is called the generator potential.\u2022 A bigger stimulus excites the membrane more, causing a bigger movement of ions and a bigger change in potential difference \u2014 so a bigger generator potential is produced.\u2022 If the generator potential is big enough it'll trigger an action potential \u2014 an electrical impulse along aneurone (see pages 136-137). An action potential is only triggered if the generator potential reaches a certain level called the threshold level. Action potentials are all one size, so the strength of the stimulus is measured by the frequency of action potentials (the number of action potentials triggered during a certain time period).\u2022 If the stimulus is too weak the generator potential won't reach the threshold, so there's no action potential.Pacinian Corpuscles are Pressure Receptors in Your Skin1) Pacinian corpuscles are mechanoreceptors \u2014 they detect mechanical stimuli, e.g. pressure and vibrationsThey're found in your skin.2) Pacinian corpuscles contain the end of a sensory neurone, imaginatively called a sensory nerve ending. The sensory nerve ending is wrapped in loads of layers of connective tissue called lamellae.3) When a Pacinian corpuscle is stimulated, e.g. by a tap on the arm, the lamellae are deformed and press on the sensory nerve ending.A) This causes the sensory neurone's cell membrane to stretch, deforming the stretch-mediated sodium ion channels. The channels open and sodium ions diffuse into the cell, creating a generator potential.5) If the generator potential reaches the threshold, it triggers an action potential.Pacinian corpuscle\nNa\u2019 channels open, so Na* diffuses into cellall other parts of the membrane have Na' channels closedlayers of connective tissue (lamellae)_ sensory nerve ending\\sensory neuroneinside of the membrane is negatively charged\u2014 compared to the outsideO1'1 ' 1 I ' 1 I II 1 | I I III M M I I I I I I I | l | l , | I I M \/\/- racmian corpuscles only respond to mechanical 3Z stimuli this is a good example of how ~- receptors only respond to specific stimuli. =\" I ' 11 \" 1 11 1 1 1 1 ' l I I I I I I W M I I I M n | | | ,, ^Photoreceptors are Light Receptors in Your Eye1) Light enters the eye through the pupil.The amount of light that enters is controlled by the muscles of the iris.2) Light rays are focused by the lens onto the retina, which lines the inside of the eye.

These same bonds are essential in protein \nstructures. In amino acids, tiny negative charges are present on the oxygen of  the carboxyl groups and tiny positive charges are present on the hydrogen atoms of  the amino groups. When these charged groups are close to each other, the opposite charges attract, forming a hydrogen bond. Hydrogen bonds are weak but, potentially, they can be made between any two amino acids in the correct position, so there are many of  them holding the protein together very firmly. They are very important in the folding and coiling of  polypeptide chains (see fig C). Hydrogen bonds break easily and reform if  pH or temperature conditions change.\nDISULFIDE BONDS\nDisulfide bonds form when two cysteine molecules are close together in the structure of  a polypeptide (see fig C). An oxidation reaction occurs between the two sulfur-containing groups, resulting in a strong covalent bond known as a disulfide bond. These disulfide bonds are much stronger than hydrogen bonds but they happen much less often. They are important for holding the folded polypeptide chains in place.\nhydrogen bondhydrogen bond\ndisul\ufb01de bonddisul\ufb01de bond\n\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\n\u25b2 fig C  Hydr ogen bonds and disulfide bonds maintain the shape of protein molecules and this determines  \ntheir function.\nIONIC BONDS\nIonic bonds can form between some of  the strongly positive and negative amino acid side chains \nwhich are sometimes found deep inside the protein molecules. They are strong bonds, but they are not as common as the other structural bonds.\nY our hair is made of  the protein keratin. Some methods of  styling hair change the bonds within the protein \nmolecules. Blow drying or straightening hair breaks the hydrogen bonds and temporarily reforms them with the hair curling in a different way until the hydrogen bonds reform in their original places.\nPerming is a chemical treatment which is used in some hair salons to completely change the way hair \nlooks for weeks or months. The chemicals break the disulfide bonds between the polypeptide chains and reform them in a different place. This effect is permanent \u2013 hair will stay styled in that particular way until it is cut off.\nPROTEIN STRUCTURE\nProteins can be described by their primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure (see fig\u00a0D). \n \u2022T\nhe primary structure of  a protein is the sequence of  amino acids that make up the polypeptide \nchain, held together by peptide bonds.\n \u2022T\nhe secondary structure of  a protein is the arrangement of  the polypeptide chain into a regular, \nrepeating three-dimensional (3D) structure, held together by hydrogen bonds. One example is the right-handed helix (\u03b1-helix), a spiral coil with the peptide bonds forming the backbone and the R\u00a0groups protruding in all directions. Another is the \u00df-pleated sheet, in which the polypeptide chain folds into regular pleats held together by hydrogen bonds between the amino and carboxyl ends of  the amino acids. Most fibrous proteins have this type of  structure. Sometimes there is no regular secondary structure and the polypeptide forms a random coil.LEARNING TIP\nRemember that fibrous proteins \nhave a simpler structure and so tend to be more stable to changes in temperature and pH.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

And here's why...Totipotent Stem Cells are Able to Mature into Any Type of Body Cell1) Multicellular organisms are made up from many different cell types that are specialised for their function, e.g. liver cells, muscle cells, white blood cells.2) All these specialised cell types originally came from stem cells.3) Stem cells are unspecialised cells that can develop into other types of cell.4) Stem cells divide to become new cells, which then become specialised.5) All multicellular organisms have some form of stem cell.6) Stem cells are found in the embryo (where they become all the specialised cells needed to form a fetus) and in some adult tissues (where they become specialised cells that need to be replaced, e.g. stem cells in the intestines constantly replace intestinal epithelial cells).7) Stem cells that can mature (develop) into any type of body cell in an organism,(including the cells that make up the placenta in mammals) are called totipotent cells.8) Totipotent stem cells are only present in mammals in the first few cell divisions of an embryo.9) After this point the embryonic stem cells become pluripotent. They can still specialise into any cell in the body, but lose the ability to become the cells that make up the placenta.10) The stem cells present in adult mammals are either:\u2022 Multipotent stem cells \u2014 These are able to differentiate into a few different types of cell. For example, both red and white blood cells can be formed from multipotent stem cells found in bone marrow.\u2022 Unipotent stem cells \u2014 These can only differentiate into one type of cell.For example, there's a type of unipotent stem cell that can only divide to produce epidermal skin cells, which make up the outer layer of your skin.Stem Cells Become Specialised Because Different Genes are ExpressedStem cells become specialised because during their development, they only transcribe and translate part of their DNA:1)2)3)4)5)6)Stem cells all contain the same genes \u2014 but during development, not all of them are transcribed and translated (expressed).\"Mill III,, ,, m\u201e(\/- Remember: transcription is 3 Z when DNA is copied into ^- mRNA.

Other genes, such as those involved in removing the nucleus, are expressed too. Many other genes are not expressed (switched off), resulting in a specialised red blood cell.Topic 8A \u2014 Mutations and Gene Expression\n","128":"26Eukaryotic Cells and OrganellesORGANELLEDIAGRAMDESCRIPTIONFUNCTIONGolgi VesiclevesicleA small fluid-filled sac inthe cytoplasm, surrounded by a membrane and produced by the Golgi apparatus.Stores lipids and proteins made by the Golgi apparatus and transports them out of the cell (via the cell-surface membrane).LysosomeoA round organelle surrounded by a membrane, with no clear internal structure.

This enzyme can react with asubstrate to produce a coloured product. This causes the solution in the reaction vessel to change colour.4) If there's a colour change, it demonstrates that the antigen or antibody of interest is present in the sample being tested (e.g. blood plasma). In some types of ELISA, the quantity of this antigen\/antibody can be worked out from the intensity of the colour change.5) There are several different types of ELISA. Direct ELISA uses a single antibody that is complementary to the antigen you're testing for. Indirect ELISA is different because it uses two different antibodies.This method is outlined below:EXAMPLE: Using an ELISA as a HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) TestAn indirect ELISA test can be used to see if a patient possesses antibodies to the HIV virus:0 HIV antigen is bound to the bottom of a well in a well plate (a plastic tray with loads of little circular pits in it).\u00a9 A sample of the patient's blood plasma, which might contain several different antibodies, is added to the well.If there are any HIV-specific antibodies (i.e. antibodies against HIV) these will bind to the HIV antigen stuck to the bottom of the well. The well is then washed out to remove any unbound antibodies.(3) A secondary antibody, that has a specific enzyme attached to it, is added to the well.This secondary antibody can bind to the HIV-specific antibody (which is also called the primary antibody).The well is washed out again to remove any unbound secondary antibody. If there's no primary antibody in the sample, all of the secondary antibody will be washed away.(?) A solution is added to the well. This solution contains a substrate, which is able to react with the enzyme attached to the secondary antibody and produce a coloured product. If the solution changes colour, it indicates that the patient has HIV-specific antibodies in their blood and is infected with HIV.antibody specific to HIV antigenantibody not specific to HIV antigenHIVantigensecondary antibody with attached enzymecolour change = HIV is present (positive result)wash out 1= 0vXwash out(T) HIV antigen bound to bottom of the well(2) plasma sample added@ secondary antibody added(J) substrate addeds\\l I II II II II II I I I II I I I I i M II 11 \\ I I I I I I I I I I i H I I II M I II i II I I I I I I I i it I I\/, ~ The washing steps are important to make sure unbound antibodies aren't left in 3 5 the well which could affect the results.

Some habitats will be more biodiverse than others.2) Global biodiversity \u2014 you could also consider the variety of species on fcarlh. Recent estimates put the total number of species on tarth at about 8.7 million. Biodiversity varies in different parts of the world \u2014 it is greatest at the equator and decreases towards the poles.Pete wasn't sure that the company's new increased biodiversity policy would be good for productivity.Biodiversity Can be Measured Using an Index of Diversity1) Species richness is a measure of the number of different species in a community. It can be worked out by taking random samples of a community (see page 100) and counting the number of different species.2) Species richness is also a simple measure of biodiversity. But the number of different species in a communityisn't the only thing that affects biodiversity. The population sizes of those species do too. Species that are in acommunity in very small numbers shouldn't be treated the same as those with bigger populations.3) An index of diversity is another way of measuring biodiversity. It's calculated using an equation that takes both the number of species in a community (species richness) and the abundance of each species (population sizes) into account.4) You can calculate an index of diversity (d) using this formula:dN(N - 1) X n(n -  1)Where...N = Total number of organisms of all species n = Total number of organisms of one species X = 'Sum of' (i.e. added together)111 *11111 I I I I I I I \/ I I I I,Z.

However; your body has systems to control your heart beat which speed it up or slow it down.Cardiac Muscle Controls the Regular Beating of the HeartCardiac (heart) muscle is 'myogenic' \u2014 it can contract and relax without receiving signals from nerves.This pattern of contractions controls the regular heartbeat.1) The process starts in the sinoatrial node (SAN), which is in the wall of the right atrium.2) The SAN is like a pacemaker \u2014 it sets the rhythm of the heartbeat by sending out regular waves of electrical activity to the atrial walls.3) This causes the right and left atria to contract at the same time.4) A band of non-conducting collagen tissue prevents the waves of electrical activity from being passed directly from the atria to the ventricles.5) Instead, these waves of electrical activity are transferred from the SAN to the atrioventricular node (AVN).6) The AVN is responsible for passing the waves of electrical activity on to the bundle of His. But, there's a slight delay before the AVN reacts, to make sure the atria have emptied before the ventricles contract.7) The bundle of His is a group of muscle fibres responsible for conducting the waves of electrical activity between the ventricles to the apex (bottom) of the heart. The bundle splits into finer muscle fibres in the right and left ventricle walls, called the Purkyne tissue.8) The Purkyne tissue carries the waves of electrical activity into the muscular walls of the right and left ventricles, causing them to contract simultaneously, from the bottom up.waves of electrical\nPurkyne tissue\nControl of Heart Rate Involves the Brain and Autonomic Nervous System1) The sinoatrial node (SAN) generates electrical impulses that cause the cardiac muscles to contract.2) The rate at which the SAN fires (i.e. heart rate) is unconsciously controlled by a part of the braincalled the medulla oblongata.3) Animals need to alter their heart rate to respond to internal stimuli, e.g. to prevent fainting due to lowblood pressure or to make sure the heart rate is high enough to supply the body with enough oxygen.4) Stimuli are detected by pressure receptors and chemical receptors:\u2022 There are pressure receptors called baroreceptors in the aorta and the carotid arteries(major arteries in the neck).

Energy from ATP is released through a hydrolysis reaction (see page 22).Water has a High Latent Heat of Vaporisation1) It takes a lot of energy (heat) to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules.2) So water has a high latent heat of vaporisation \u2014 a lot of energy is used up when water evaporates (vaporises).3) This is useful for living organisms because it means they can use water loss through evaporation to cool down (e.g. humans sweat to cool down) without losing too much water.Topic 1B \u2014 More Biological Molecules\n","133":"10Enzyme ActionEnzymes crop up loads in biology \u2014 they're really useful 'cos they make reactions work quickly. So, whether you feel the need for some speed or not, read on \u2014 because you really need to know this basic stuff about enzymes.Enzymes are Biological CatalystsEnzymes speed up chemical reactions by acting as biological catalysts. A catalyst is a substance _1)2)3)4)5)6)- readior without being _r up in the reaction\"'t 11 n ' i\" 111\" 1Enzymes catalyse metabolic reactions \u2014 both at a cellular level (e.g. respiration) and for the organism as a whole (e.g. digestion in mammals).Enzymes can affect structures in an organism (e.g. enzymes are involved in the production of collagen, an important protein in the connective tissues of animals) as well as functions (like respiration).Enzyme action can be intracellular \u2014 within cells, or extracellular \u2014 outside cells.Enzymes are proteins (see previous page).Enzymes have an active site, which has a specific shape. The active site is the part of the enzyme where the substrate molecules (the substance that the enzyme interacts with) bind to.Enzymes are highly specific due to their tertiary structure (see next page).Enzymes Lower the Activation Energy of a ReactionIn a chemical reaction, a certain amount of energy needs to be supplied to the chemicals before the reaction will start. This is called the activation energy \u2014 it's often provided as heat. Enzymes lower the amount of activation energy that's needed, often making reactions happen at a lower temperature than they could without an enzyme. This speeds up the rate of reaction.When a substrate fits into the enzyme's active site it forms an enzyme-substrate complex \u2014 it's this that lowers the activation energy. Here are two reasons why:1) If two substrate molecules need to be joined, being attached to the enzyme holds them close together, reducing any repulsion between the molecules so they can bond more easily.2) If the enzyme is catalysing a breakdown reaction, fitting into the active site puts a strain on bonds in the substrate, so the substrate molecule breaks up more easily.chemical reaction beginsactivation ener^y_neede_d _ without enzymeenergy is released as the product is formedTime- chemical reaction without enzyme-chemicalreactionwithenzymeThe \u2018L o c k  and K e y \u2019 Model is a Good Start...Enzymes are a bit picky \u2014 they only work with substrates that fit their active site. Early scientists studying the action of enzymes came up with the lock and key' model. This is where the substrate fits into the enzyme in the same way that a key fits into a lock.enzyme is unchanged\ncomplexScientists soon realised that the lock and key model didn't give the full story. The enzyme and substrate do have to fit together in the first place, but new evidence showed that the enzyme-substrate complex changed shape slightly to complete the fit. This locks the substrate even more tightly to the enzyme. Scientists modified the old lock and key model and came up with the 'induced fit' model.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","134":"56Gas ExchangeLots of organisms have developed adaptations to improve their rate of gas exchange. It's a tricky business if you're an insect or a plant though \u2014 you've got to exchange enough gas but avoid losing all your water and drying to a crisp...Gas Exchange Surfaces have Two Major AdaptationsMost gas exchange surfaces have two things in common:1) They have a large surface area.2) They're thin (often just one layer of epithelial cells)\u2014 this provides a short diffusion pathway across the gas exchange surfaceThe organism also maintains a steep concentration gradient of gases across the exchange surface.All these features increase the rate of diffusion \u2014see page 39.Single-celled Organisms Exchange Gases across their Body Surface1) Single-celled organisms absorb and release gases by diffusion through their outer surface.2) They have a relatively large surface area, a thin surface and a short diffusion pathway (oxygen can take part in biochemical reactions as soon as it diffuses into the cell)\u2014 so there's no need for a gas exchange system.Fish Use a Counter-Current System for Gas ExchangeThere's a lower concentration of oxygen in water than in air. So fish have special adaptations to get enough of it.1) Water, containing oxygen, enters the fish through its mouth and passes out through the gills.2) Each gill is made of lots of thin plates called gill filaments, which give a big surface area for exchange of gases.3) The gill filaments are covered in lots of tiny structures called artcry ___^ \/(plural = lamellae)lamellae, which increase the surface area even more.4) The lamellae have lots of blood capillaries and a thin surface layer of cells to speed up diffusion.artery (deoxygenated blood to gill)artery (oxygenated blood from the gill)lamella\nblood leaves lamella with high oxygen conc.Water flowing towards the lamella (relatively high oxygen conc.'blood enters lamella with low oxygen conc.Water flowing away from the lamella (relatively low oxygen conc.)gill filaments5) Blood flows through the lamellae in one direction and water flows over in the opposite direction. This is called a counter-current system. It maintains a large concentration gradient between the water and the blood. The concentration of oxygen in the water is always higher than that in the blood, so as much oxygen as possible diffuses from the water into the blood.Insects use Tracheae to Exchange Gasesdistance along gill platetracheae and tracheoles give large surface area1) Insects have microscopic air-filled pipes calledtracheae which they use for gas exchange. fe2) Air moves into the tracheae through pores on the surface called spiracles3) Oxygen travels down the concentration gradient towards the cells.4) The tracheae branch off into smaller tracheoles which have thin, permeable walls and go to individual cells. This means that oxygen diffuses directly into the respiring cells \u2014 the insect's circulatory system doesn't transport Or5) Carbon dioxide from the cells moves down its own concentration gradient towards the spiracles to be released into the atmosphere.6) Insects use rhythmic abdominal movements to move air in and out of the spiraclesspiracletracheole lined with single layer of cells to minimise diffusion distanceOj diffuses into respiring cellsCO, diffuses into tracheal tubesTopic 3 A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","135":"Joint ventures\nTh ese are not the same as a merger, but they can lead to \nmergers of the businesses if their joint interests coincide \nand if the joint venture is successful.

They are made of  many monosaccharide units \njoined by condensation reactions that create glycosidic bonds (see Section\u00a01A.2 fig E). Polysaccharides \ndo not have the sweet taste of  many mono- and disaccharides, but these complex polymers include some very important biological molecules.\nMolecules with between 3 and 10 sugar units are known as oligosaccharides, while molecules \ncontaining 11 or more monosaccharides are known as true polysaccharides. The glycosidic bonds in the polysaccharide can be broken to release monosaccharide units for cellular respiration.\nThe glycosidic bond between two glucose units is split by a process known as hydrolysis (see fig\u00a0A).  \nThe hydrolysis reaction is the opposite of  the condensation reaction that created the molecule, so water \nis added to the bond. Starch and glycogen are gradually broken down into shorter and shorter chains and eventually single sugars are left. Disaccharides break down to form two monosaccharides. Hydrolysis takes place during digestion in the gut, and also in the muscle and liver cells when the carbohydrate stores are broken down to release sugars for use in cellular respiration (see Book 2 Chapter 7A).\nH\nHOH\nOHO\n1 46\n2 35\n1,4-glycosidic bondH\nHO OHH O\n1 4\n2 356\nH\nHOH O\n1 4\n2 356H\nOOHH O\n1 4\n2 356\nmaltosecondensation hydrolysis\nH2O H2O\u03b1-glucose \u03b1-glucose\n\u25b2 fig A  Gly cosidic bonds are made by condensation reactions and broken down by hydrolysis.\nCARBOHYDRATES AND ENERGY \nMONOSACCHARIDES AND DISACCHARIDES\nEvery chemical reaction taking place in a cell needs energy.

Y ou will learn much more about cellular respiration later in your course in Book 2 Chapter 7A. \nThe arrangement of  atoms in a molecule of  \u03b1-glucose means that it can be broken down completely \nin a series of  reactions, if  oxygen is available.

Harsh I know.Before You Start Planning, Be Clear on What You\u2019re Trying to Find OutLike all scientists, you should start off by making a prediction or hypothesis \u2014 a specific testable statement, based on theory, about what will happen in the experiment. You then need to plan a good experiment that will provide evidence to support the prediction \u2014 or help disprove it.A Good Experiment Gives Results that are...D\\\\l I U I \\ I I I II 1\/ r I l My Z Precise results are 3 - sometimes referred - Z to as reliable results, c \"W; 111111 ii 1 if 11111Precise \u2014 precise results don't vary much from the mean. Precision is reduced by random error (the unpredictable way in which all measurements vary).Repeatable and reproducible \u2014 repeatable means that if the same person repeats the experiment using the same methods and equipment, they will get the same results. Reproducible means that if someone different does the experiment, using a slightly different method or piece of equipment, the results will still be the same. Valid \u2014 valid results answer the original question. To get valid results you need to control all the variables (see below) to make sure you're only testing the thing you want to.Accurate \u2014 accurate results are really close to the true answer. Human interpretation of a measurement (e.g. determining a colour change) can reduce the accuracy of results.Here are some things you need to consider when designing a good experiment:2)3)4)D2)EXAMPLE:3)Only one variable should be changed \u2014Variables are quantities that have the potential to change, e.g. pH. In an experiment you usually change one variable and measure its effect on another variable.\u2022 The variable that you change is called the independent variable.\u2022 The variable that you measure is called the dependent variable.All the other variables should be controlled \u2014When you're investigating a variable you need to keep everything else that could affect it constant.This means you can be sure that only your independent variable is affecting the thing you're measuring (the dependent variable).Negative controls should be used \u2014Negative controls are used to check that only the independent variable is affecting the dependent variable. Negative controls aren't expected to have any effect on the experiment.1)2)3)4)5)4)Investigating the effect of light intensity on rate of photosynthesis of Canadian pondweedLight intensity is the independent variable.Rate of photosynthesis is the dependent variable. pH, temperature and the time the pondweed is left should all stay the same (and the quantities should be recorded to allow someone else to reproduce the experiment).The experiment should be repeated at least three times for each light intensity used.A negative control, in which the experiment is carried out in the dark, should also be used.No photosynthesis should happen with this control.The experiment should be repeated at least three times and a mean should be calculated \u2014 this reduces the effect of random error on your experiment, which makes your results more precise. Doing repeats and getting similar results each time also shows that your data is repeatable and makes it more likely to be reproducible.Examiners love getting you to comment on experimental design or suggest improvements to methods \u2014 e.g. how a method could be improved to make the results more precise. So make sure you know how to design a good experiment.Select Appropriate Apparatus, Equipment and Techniques1) When you're planning an experiment you need to decide what it is you're going to measure and how often you're going to take measurements. E.g. if you're investigating the rate of respiration, you could either measure the volume of oxygen used over time or the volume of carbon dioxide produced over time. You could take measurements at, e.g. 30 second intervals or 60 second intervals.2) Then you need to choose the most appropriate apparatus, equipment and techniques for the experiment. E.g.\u2022 The measuring apparatus you use has to be sensitive enough to measure the changes you're looking for.For example, if you need to measure small changes in pH, a pH meter (which can measure pH to several decimal places) would be more sensitive than indicator paper.\u2022 The technique you use has to be the most appropriate one for your experiment. E.g. if you want to measure the concentration of glucose in an unknown solution, using a colorimeter in conjunction with quantitative Benedict's reagent (see page 151) will help you to get more accurate results than simply comparing the colour differences of the solutions by eye.Practical Skills\n","138":"39 1B.3 CIRCULATION IN THE BLOOD VESSELS MAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS\nsmooth inner surface\nouter tough layer consisting\nmainly of collagen \ufb01bresrelatively thin layer of smooth muscle with few elastic \ufb01bres\nrelatively large lumen\nvein\nartery\n\u25b2 fig D  T he arrangement of tissues in a vein reflects the pressure of blood  \nin the vessel.\nEventually only two veins (sometimes called the great veins) carry \nthe blood from the body tissues back to the heart \u2013 the inferior vena cava from the lower parts of  the body and the superior vena cava from the upper parts of  the body.\nVeins can hold a large volume of  blood \u2013 in fact more than half  of  \nthe body\u2019s blood volume is in the veins at any one time.

Ecosystems have developed a much better system to make sure necessary elements like nitrogen and phosphorus can be recycled and don't run out.Fungi and Bacteria Have an Important Role in Nutrient Recycling1) A natural ecosystem is one that hasn't been changed by human activity. In natural ecosystems nutrients are recycled though the food webs, but human activity often disrupts the cycling of nutrients.2) Microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, are an important part of food webs. Many are saprobionts (a type of decomposer) \u2014 they feed on the remains of dead plants and animals and on their waste products (faeces, urine), breaking them down. This allows important chemical elements in the remains to be recycled.3) Saprobionts secrete enzymes and digest their food externally, then absorb the nutrients they need. This is known as extracellular digestion. During this process, organic molecules are broken down into inorganic ions. Obtaining nutrients from dead organic matter using extracellular digestion is known as saprobiotic nutrition.4) Some fungi form symbiotic relationships with the roots of plants. These relationships are known as mycorrhizae.\u2022 The fungi are made up of long, thin strands called hyphae, which connect to the plant's roots.\u2022 The hyphae greatly increase the surface area of the plant's root system, helping the plant to absorb ions from the soil that are usually scarce (e.g. phosphorus). Hyphae also increase the uptake of water by the plant.\u2022 In turn, the fungi obtain organic compounds, such as glucose, from the plant.The Nitrogen Cycle shows how Nitrogen is Recycled in EcosystemsPlants and animals need nitrogen to make proteins and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). The atmosphere's made up of about 78% nitrogen gas, but plants and animals can't use it in that form \u2014 they need bacteria to convert it into nitrogen-containing compounds first. The nitrogen cycle shows how nitrogen is converted into a usable form and then passed on between different living organisms and the non-living environment.The nitrogen cycle includes food chains (nitrogen is passed on when organisms are eaten), and four different processes that involve bacteria \u2014 nitrogen fixation, ammonification, nitrification and denitrification:(T) Nitrogen fixation\u00a3AtmosphericnitrogenThe Nitrogen CycleNitrogen compounds plantsNitrogen fixation is when nitrogen gas in theatmosphere is turned into nitrogen-containing __________________ ____compounds. Biological nitrogen fixation is carried out (denitrifigmion) by bacteria such as Rhizobium.

This could make the whole crop vulnerable to the same disease because the plants are genetically identical. Environmentalists are also concerned about monocultures reducing biodiversity, as this could damage the environment.Some people are concerned about the possibility of 'superweeds' \u2014 weeds that are resistant to herbicides. These could occur if transformed crops interbreed with wild plants. There could then be an uncontrolled spread of recombinant DNA, with unknown consequences.Organic farmers can have their crops contaminated by wind-blown seeds from nearby genetically modified crops. This means they can't sell their crop as organic and may lose their income.IndustryAnti-globalisation activists oppose globalisation (e.g. the growth of large multinational companies at the expense of smaller ones). A few, large biotechnology companies control some forms of genetic engineering. As the use of this technology increases, these companies get bigger and more powerful. This may force smaller companies out of business, e.g. by making it harder for them to compete. Without proper labelling, some people think they won't have a choice about whether to consume food made using genetically engineered organisms.Some consumer markets, such as the EU, won't import GM foods and products. This can cause an economic loss to producers who have traditionally sold to those markets.MedicineCompanies who own genetic engineering technologies may limit the use of technologies that could be saving lives.Some people worry this technology could be used unethically, e.g. to make designer babies (babies that have characteristics chosen by their parents). This is currently illegal though.Recombinant DNA technology also creates ownership issues. Here are some examples:\u2022 There is some debate about who owns genetic material from humans once it has been removed from the body \u2014 the donor or the researcher. Some people argue that the individual holds the right to their own genetic information, however others argue that value is created by the researcher who uses it to develop a medicine or in diagnosis.\u2022 A small number of large corporations own patents to particular seeds. They can charge high prices, sometimes including a 'technology fee', and can require farmers to repurchase seeds each year.If non-GM crops are contaminated by GM crops, farmers can be sued for breaching the patent law....But Humanitarians Think it will Benefit PeopleRecombinant DNA technology has many potential humanitarian benefits:1) Agricultural crops could be produced that help reduce the risk of famine and malnutrition, e.g. drought-resistant crops for drought-prone areas.2) Transformed crops could be used to produce useful pharmaceutical products (e.g. vaccines) which could make drugs available to more people, e.g. in areas where refrigeration (usually needed for storing vaccines) isn't available.3) Mcdicines could be produced more chcaply, so more people can afford them.4) Recombinant DNA technology has the potential to be used in gene therapy to treat human diseases (see next page).>0U need to be able z- to balance the humanitarian : r h\/neflts opposing views =- from environmentalists and ~ S ant|-9|obalisat,on activists r(see above) -Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n","143":"164Topic 7B \u2014 Populations and EvolutionThe Hardy-Weinberg PrincipleSometimes you need to look at the genetics of a whole population, rather than a cross between just two individuals.

It predicts that the frequencies of alleles in a population won't change from one generation to the next.2) But this prediction is only true under certain conditions \u2014 it has to be a large population where there's no immigration, emigration, mutations or natural selection. There also needs to be random mating \u2014 all possible genotypes can breed with all others.3) The Hardy-Weinberg equations (see below) can be used to calculate the frequency of particular alleles, genotypes and phenotypes within populations.4) The equations can also be used to test whether or not the Hardy-Weinberg principle applies to particular alleles in particular populations, i.e. to test whether selection or any other factors are influencing allele frequencies.\u2014 if frequencies do change between generations in a large population then there is an influence of some kind.The Hardy-Weinberg Equations Can be Used to Predict Allele Frequency...When a gene has two alleles, you can figure out the frequency of one of the alleles of the gene if you know the frequency of the other allele, using this equation:Where: p = the frequency of one allele, usually the dominant oneq = the frequency of the other allele, usually the recessive oneThe total frequency of all possible alleles for a characteristic in a certain population is lO. So the frequencies of the individual alleles (e.g. the dominant one and the recessive one) must add up to 1.0.E.g. a species of plant has either red or white flowers.

The diffusion rate is quick because of the small distances the substances have to travel (see p. 39).2) In multicellular animals, diffusion across the outer membrane is too slow, for two reasons:\u2022 Some cells are deep within the body \u2014 there's a big distance between them and the outside environment.\u2022 Larger animals have a low surface area to volume ratio \u2014 it's difficult to exchange enough substances to supply a large volume of animal through a relatively small outer surface.So rather than using straightforward diffusion to absorb and excrete substances, multicellular animals need specialised exchange organs (like lungs \u2014 see p. 58).They also need an efficient system to carry substances to and from their individual cells \u2014 this is mass transport.In mammals, 'mass transport' normally refers to the circulatory system (see p. 70), which uses blood to carry glucose and oxygen around the body. It also carries hormones, antibodies (p. 44) and waste like CO,.Mass transport in plants involves the transport of water and solutes in the xylem and phloem (see pages 78 and 80).Topic 3 A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","145":"128 Topic 6A \u2014 Stimuli and ResponsesNervous CommunicationYour body has an amazing network of nerve cells which constantly send electrical signals \u2014 a bit like a big circuit board.Responding to their Environment Helps Organisms Survive1) Animals increase their chances of survival by responding to changes in their external environment, e.g. by avoiding harmful environments such as places that are too hot or too cold.2) They also respond to changes in their internal environment to make sure that the conditionsare always optimal for their metabolism (ail the chemical reactions that go on inside them).3) Plants also increase their chances of survival by responding to changes in their environment (see p. 130).4) Any change in the internal or external environment is called a stimulus.Receptors Detect Stimuli and Effectors Produce a Response1) Receptors detect stimuli \u2014 they can be cells or proteins on cell surface membranes. ^1'1\" M 1\" 1\" \" \\There are loads of different types of receptors that detect different stimuli. 5 ^^jftype^f stimulus '2) Effectors are cells that bring about a response to a stimulus, to produce an effect. ; _ see p. 132.Effectors include muscle cells and cells found in glands, e.g. the pancreas.

But when a female carrier and a male without colour-blindness have children (as in this example), only their male offspring are at risk of being colour-blind. So you can also say that there's a predicted 2:1:1 ratio \u2014 of female offspring without colour-blindness : male offspring without colour-blindness : male offspring with colour-blindness.8) This ratio will change if a female carrier (XNXn) and a male with colour-blindness (XnY) have children.The predicted ratio will then be 1 : 1 \u2014 of offspring with colour-blindness : offspring without colour-blindness. The ratio will be the same for offspring of each gender. You only end up with this predicted ratio for a monohybrid F, cross with a sex-linked characteristic.Some Autosomal Genes are LinkedD2)Autosome is the fancy name for any chromosome that isn't a sex chromosome.Autosomal genes are the genes located on the autosomes.Genes on the same autosome are said to be linked \u2014 because they're on the same autosome they'll stay together during the independent segregation of chromosomes in meiosis I, and their alleles will be passed on to the offspring together. The only reason this won't happen is if crossing over splits them up first3) The closer together two genes are on the autosome,the more closely they are said to be linked. This is because Genes A, B crossing over is less likely to split them up. T ^4) If two genes are autosomally linked, you won't get the ~ phenotypic ratio you expect in the offspring of a cross.5) For example, in a dihybrid cross between two heterozygous parents you'd expect a 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 ratio in the offspring (see previous page). Instead, the phenotypic ratio is more likely to be that expected for a monohybrid cross between two heterozygous parents (3:1) because the two autosomally-linked alleles are inherited together. This means that a higher proportion of the offspring will have their parents' (heterozygous) genotype and phenotype.6) This allows you to use the predicted phenotypic ratio to identify autosomal linkage.Topic 7A \u2014 Geneticsand C are all linked.Crossing over is when two homologous (paired) chromosomes swap bits'.

Check that the apparatus is watertight and airtight.Dry the leaves, allow time for the shoot to acclimatise, and then shut the tap.Remove the end of the capillary tube from the beaker of water until one air bubble has formed, then put the end of the tube back into the water.Record the starting position of the air bubble.Start a stopwatch and record the distance moved by the bubble per unit time, e.g. per hour. The rate of air bubble movement is an estimate of the transpiration rate.Remember, only change one variable (e.g. temperature) at a time. All other conditions (e.g. light, humidity) must be kept constant.You Might Have to Dissect PlantsYou can look at xylem or phloem in plant tissue (e.g. part of a plant stem) under a microscope, and then draw them. But first you need to dissect the plant and prepare a section of the tissue. You can do this using the following method:1) Use a scalpel (or razor blade) to cut a cross-section of the stem. Cut the sections as thinly as possible \u2014 thin sections are better for viewing under a microscope.2) Use tweezers to gently place the cut sections in water until you come to use them. This stops them from drying out.3) Transfer each section to a dish containing a stain, e.g. toluidine blue O (TBO), and leave for one minute. TBO stains the lignin in the walls of the xylem vessels blue-green.This will let you see the position of the xylem vessels and examine their structure.4) Rinse off the sections in water and mount each one onto a slide (see page 30).Practice QuestionsQ1 What is the function of xylem tissue?Q2 Give four factors that affect transpiration rate.Q3 Name a piece of apparatus used to measure transpiration rate.Exam QuestionQ1 a) What is meant by the term transpiration?

Natural selection affects different populations in different ways, as you'll soon discover...Different Types of Natural Selection Lead to Different Frequency PatternsYou might remember from the previous page that natural selection alters allele frequency in a population. Stabilising selection and directional selection are types of natural selection that affect allele frequencyin different ways. You need to learn these examples:Antibiotic Resistance Shows Directional SelectionDirectional selection is where individuals with alleles for characteristics of an extreme type are more likely to survive and reproduce. This could be in response to an environmental change. Bacteria evolving antibiotic resistance is an example of directional selection. Here's how it works:1) Some individuals in a population have alleles that give them resistance to an antibiotic.2) The population is exposed to the antibiotic, killing bacteria without the resistant allele.3) The resistant bacteria survive and reproduce without competition, passing on the allele that gives antibiotic resistance to their offspring.4) After some time, most organisms in the population will carry the antibiotic resistance allele.PARENTSik totali iton$3T5population \/\"rrs\\ breeding ^\u0000>_CA-^population ^o\/ \\ l=^> t<y_Ci1 \\ \/ \\\u00a3c\/ \\ \u00a3 \\ 3 \\ C---------^ . \u0000OFFSPRING\nlowantibiotic resistancehighantibiotic resistanceHuman Birth Weight Shows Stabilising SelectionStabilising selection is where individuals with alleles for characteristics towards the middle of the range are more likely to survive and reproduce. It occurs when the environment isn't changing, and it reduces the range of possible characteristics. An example of stabilising selection is human birth weight.1) Humans have a range of birth weights.2) Very small babies are less likely to survive \u2014 partly because they find it hard to maintain their body temperature.3) Giving birth to large babies can be difficult, so large babies are less likely to survive too.4) Conditions are most favourable for medium-sized babies \u2014 so weight of human babies tends to shift towards the middle of the range.PARENTStotal populationbreedingpopulationOFFSPRING\nweight of babylight--!\"\u0000weight of baby hcav7You Need to be Able to Interpret Data on the Effects of SelectionYou might be asked to interpret information about an unfamiliar species in the exam.

June wanted the business to grow and \nshe thought the best way to do this was to buy another \nbeauty salon in another area of the city. \u2018This will get \nthe business name really well-known and will give us \nthe basis for further sales growth of at least 20% a year,\u2019 \nshe told Will.

This means the mineral ions that they contain (e.g. phosphates and nitrates) are not returned to the soil by decomposers in the nitrogen or phosphorus cycles.3) Phosphates and nitrates are also lost from the system when animals or animal productsare removed from the land. Animals eat grass and other plants, taking in their nutrients.When they are taken elsewhere for slaughter or transferred to a different field, the nutrients aren't replaced through their remains or waste products.Fertilisers are Added to Soils to Replace Lost NutrientsAdding fertiliser replaces the lost minerals, so more energy from the ecosystem can be used for growth, increasing the efficiency of energy transfer. Fertilisers can be artificial or natural.Artificial fertilisers are inorganic \u2014 they contain pure chemicals (e.g. ammonium nitrate) as powders or pellets.Natural fertilisers are organic matter \u2014 they include manure, composted vegetables, crop residues (the parts left over after the harvest) and sewage sludge.True, Daisy had a dippy fringe, but she sure could produce a lot of fertiliser.Using Fertilisers Raises Environmental Issues1) Sometimes more fertiliser is applied than the plants need or are able to use at a particular time.2) This can lead to the fertilisers leaching into waterways.3) Leaching is when water-soluble compounds in the soil are washed away, e.g. by rain or irrigation systems. They're often washed into nearby ponds and rivers.4) This can lead to eutrophication (see next page).5) Leaching is more likely to occur if the fertiliser is applied just before heavy rainfall.6) Inorganic ions in chemical fertilisers are relatively soluble. This means that excess minerals that are not used immediately are more likely to leach into waterways. In natural fertilisers, the nitrogen and phosphorus are still contained in organic molecules that need to be decomposed by microorganisms before they can be absorbed by plants. This means that their release into the soil for uptake by plants is more controlled, and leaching is less likely.7) The leaching of phosphates is less likely than the leaching of nitrates because phosphates are less soluble in water.8) Using fertilisers also changes the balance of nutrients in the soil \u2014too much of a particular nutrient can cause crops and other plants to die.Topic 5B \u2014 Energy Transfer and Nutrient Cycles\n","153":"66 Topic 3BMore Exchange and Transport SystemsDigestion and AbsorptionThe whole point of digestion is to break down the food you eat into small molecules that your cells can absorb. As you might imagine, this involves loads of different chemical reactions and our old friends, enzymes.Food is Broken Down into Smaller Molecules During Digestion1) The large biological molecules (e.g. starch, proteins) in food are too big to cross cell membranes.This means they can't be absorbed from the gut into the blood.2) During digestion, these large molecules are broken down into smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, amino acids), which can move across cell membranes. This means they can be easily absorbed from the gut into the blood, to be transported around the body for use by the body cells.3) You might remember from Topic 1 A, that most large biological molecules are polymers, which can be broken down into smaller molecules (monomers) using hydrolysis reactions.Hydrolysis reactions break bonds by adding water.4) During hydrolysis, carbohydrates are broken down into disaccharides and then monosaccharides.Fats are broken down into fatty acids and monoglycerides. Proteins are broken down into amino acids.Digestive Enzymes are Used to Break Down Biological Molecules in Food1) A variety of different digestive enzymes are produced by specialised cells in the digestive systems of mammals. These enzymes are then released into the gut to mix with food.2) Since enzymes only work with specific substrates (see page 11), different enzymes are needed to catalyse the breakdown of different food molecules.Carbohydrates are Broken Down by Amylase and Membrane-Bound Disaccharidases1) Amylase is a digestive enzyme that catalyses the conversion of starch (a polysaccharide) into the smaller sugar maltose (a disaccharide). This involves the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds in starch.2) Amylase is produced by the salivary glands (which release amylase into the mouth) and also by the pancreas (which releases amylase into the small intestine).3) Membrane-bound disaccharidases are enzymes that are attached to the cell membranes of epithelial cellslining the ileum (the final part of the small intestine). They help to break down disaccharides (e.g. maltose, sucrose and lactose) into monosaccharides (e.g. glucose, fructose and galactose). Again, this involves the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds.<v\\u i \" i J1111111111 \/ I i, l I I I 11111,~ There s more on polysaccharides, tl ~ disaccharides and monosaccharides \u2014- on pages 2-5. \"\/> 111111' 11 n w i \/ it 1111111111 n4) Monosaccharides can be transported across the cell membranes of the ileum epithelial cells via specific transporter proteins (see next page).DisaccharideDisaccharidaseMonosaccharide Productsmaltosemaltaseglucose + glucosesucrosesucraseglucose + fructoselactoselactaseglucose + galactoseLipids are Broken Down by Lipase (with the Help of Bile Salts)1) Lipase enzymes catalyse the breakdown of lipids into monoglycerides and fatty acids. This involves the hydrolysis of the ester bonds in lipids.2) Lipases are made in the pancreas. They work in the small intestine.3) Bile salts are produced by the liver and emulsify lipids \u2014 this means they cause the lipids to form small droplets.4) Bile salts are really important in the process of lipid digestion. Several small lipid droplets have a bigger surface area than a single large droplet (for the same volume of lipid). So the formation of small droplets greatly increases the surface area of lipid that's available for lipases to work on.\u00a3 monoglyceride is a C- glycerol molecule with \u00a3 ~ one fatty acid attached =\nemulsificationbile saltsbiglipid dropletA \/V,\/ lipase digestion\u00b0o\u00b0of lipidsmall lipid dropletsmonoglycerides & fatty acids \u00b00\u00b0\u00b00 micelles5) Once the lipid has been broken down, the monoglycerides and fatty acids stick with the bile salts to form tiny structures called micelles.Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n","154":"73The HeartThe Cardiac Cycle Pumps Blood Round the BodyThe cardiac cycle is an ongoing sequence of contraction and relaxation of the atria and ventricles that keeps blood continuously circulating round the body. The volume of the atria and ventricles changes as they contract and relax. Pressure changes also occur, due to the changes in chamber volume (e.g. decreasing the volume of a chamber by contraction will increase the pressure in a chamber). The cardiac cycle can be simplified into three stages:\u00a9 ( Ventricles relax, atria contract )The ventricles are relaxed.The atria contract, decreasing the volume of the chambers and increasing the pressure inside the chambers. This pushes the blood into the ventricles. There's a slight increase in ventricular pressure and chamber volume as the ventricles receive the ejected blood from the contracting atria.\u00a9AtriaSL valves closed\nAV valves are open\\ \/( Ventricles contract, atria relax )The atria relax. The ventricles contract (decreasing their volume), increasing their pressure. The pressure becomes higher in the ventricles than the atria, which forces the AV valves shut to prevent back-flow. The pressure in the ventricles is also higher than in the aorta and pulmonary artery, which forces open the SL valves and blood is forced out into these arteries.\\ \/(Ventricles relax, atria relax\")The ventricles and the atria both relax.The higher pressure in the pulmonary artery and aorta closes the SL valves to prevent back-flow into the ventricles. Blood returns to the heart and the atria fill again due to the higher pressure in the vena cava and pulmonary vein. In turn this starts to increase the pressure of the atria. As the ventricles continue to relax, their pressure falls below the pressure of the atria and so the AV valves open. This allows blood to flow passively (without being pushed by atrial contraction) into the ventricles from the atria.

This can lead to classification systems being updated. Technologies that have been useful for clarifying evolutionary relationships include:Genome sequencing \u2014 Advances in genome sequencing have meant that the entire base sequence of an organism's DNA can be determined. The DNA base sequence of one organism can then be compared to the DNA base sequence of another organism, to see how closely related they are. Closely related species will have a higher percentage of similarity in their DNA base order, e.g. humans and chimps share around 94%, humans and mice share about 86%.Genome sequencing has clarified the relationship between skunks and members of the Mustelidae family (e.g. weasels and badgers). Skunks were classified in the Mustelidae family until their DNA sequence was revealed to be significantly different to other members of that family. So they were reclassified into the family Mephitidae.Comparing amino acid sequence \u2014 Proteins are made of amino acids. The sequence of amino acids in a protein is coded for by the base sequence in DNA (see p. 82). Related organisms have similar DNA sequences and so similar amino acid sequences in their proteins. E.g. cytochrome C is a short protein found in many species. The more similar the amino acid sequence of cytochrome C in two different species, the more closely related the species are likely to be.Immunological comparisons \u2014 Similar proteinswill also bind the same antibodies (see p. 44). E.g. if antibodies to a human version of a protein are added to isolated samples from some other species, any protein that's like the human version will also be recognised (bound) by that antibody.H~ G  d \/Chimpanzee ^\"^3n\/ Antibodies thatO recognise human proteinSo, the chimp protein is more similar to the human one than the mouse protein.You Need to be Able to Interpret Data on DNA and Protein SimilaritiesHere are two examples of the kind of thing you might get:Species ASpecies BSpecies CSpecies D'Species A100%86%42%44%Species B86%100%51%53%Species C42%51%100%91%Species D44%53%91%100%kThe table on the left shows the % similarityof DNA using DNA sequence analysis between several species of bacteria.b can also use -r DNA base sequences Sr to see how closely ~ Z re*ated two members of -The data shows that species A and B are more closely related to each other than r the same species they are to either C or D.

These are the factors we can change, so we can change our risk of  developing CVDs by the lifestyle choices we make.\nSMOKING AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nStudies have shown that smokers are far more likely to develop atherosclerosis than non-smokers with a similar lifestyle. Nine out of  ten people who need heart bypass surgery or stents as a result of  atherosclerosis are smokers. In 2007, a Spanish study showed a clear correlation between smoking and the incidence of  death from atherosclerotic heart disease. Causation was established by further research. For example, studies found that the substances in tobacco smoke:\n \u2022can dama\nge the artery linings, which makes the build-up of  plaques more likely\n \u2022can cause the ar\nteries to narrow, raise the blood pressure and increase the risk of  atherosclerosis.\nSimilar findings were made in a study on adults with heart disease in Jordan in 2017 (see fig B).1.16 1.12\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Proteins make \nhair, skin and nails, the enzymes needed for metabolism and digestion, and many of  the hormones that control the different body systems. They enable muscle fibres to contract, make antibodies that protect you from disease, help clot your blood and transport oxygen in the form of  haemoglobin. Understanding the structure of  proteins helps you understand the detailed biology of  cells and organisms. Like carbohydrates and lipids, proteins contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. In addition, they all contain nitrogen and many proteins also contain sulfur.\nProteins are a group of  macromolecules made up of  many \nsmall monomer units called amino acids joined together by condensation reactions. Amino acids combine in long chains to produce proteins. There are about 20 different naturally occurring amino acids that can combine in different ways to produce a wide range of  different proteins.\nAMINO ACIDS\nAll amino acids have the same basic structure, which is represented as a general formula. There is always an amino group (\u2013NH\n2) and a carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) attached to a carbon \natom (see fig A). The group known as the R group varies between amino acids. Some amino acids contain sulfur and selenium in their R group. The R groups are not involved in the reactions which join the amino acids together, but the structure of  the R group does affect the way the amino acid interacts with others within the protein molecule. This will mainly depend on whether the R\u00a0group is polar or not, and these interactions affect the tertiary structure of  the protein formed (see page 18).\nThis part is common \nto all amino acids and \nis just shown as a \nshaded rectangle in the examples below.general formula\nglycine cysteineN HR\nH HCC OH\nO\nHC H2SH\n \n\u25b2 fig A  Some differ ent amino acids.

They join in a condensation reaction and a molecule of  water is released. A peptide bond is formed when two amino acids join, and a dipeptide is the result (see fig B). The R group is not involved in this reaction. More and more amino acids join to form polypeptide chains, which contain from about 100 to many thousands of  amino acids. A polypeptide forms a protein when the structure of  the chain changes by folding or coiling or associates with other polypeptide chains.\namino acid 1\ndipeptidepeptide\nbondamino acid 2 (inverted)\nOH + OH N H\nH HCC\nON HHH\nCCO\nOH N H\nH HC C\nONHH\nCCOcondensation hydrolysisR1\nR1R2\nR2H2O H2O\n\u25b2 fig B  Amino acids ar e the building blocks of proteins, joined together  \nby peptide bonds.\nBONDS IN PROTEINS\nThe peptide bond between amino acids is a strong bond.

This is a prime example of how a widely accepted theory can change when new evidence comes along. The 'induced fit' model is still widely accepted \u2014 for now, anyway.\nenzymeas the substrate binds the active site changes shape slightly.productsXsubstrateenzyme-substratecomplexThe \u2018Luminous Tights\u2019 model was popular in the 1980s but has since been found to be grossly inappropriate.Enzyme Properties Relate to Their Tertiary Structure1) Enzymes are very specific \u2014 they usually only catalyse one reaction, e.g. maltase only breaks down maltose, sucrase only breaks down sucrose.2) This is because only one complementary substrate will fit into the active site.3) The active site's shape is determined by the enzyme's tertiary structure (which is determined by the enzyme's primary structure).4) Each different enzyme has a different tertiary structure and so a different shaped active site.If the substrate shape doesn't match the active site, an enzyme-substrate complex won't be formed and the reaction won't be catalysed.5) If the tertiary structure of the enzyme is altered in any way, the shape of the active site will change. This means the substrate won't fit into the active site, an enzyme-substrate complex won't be formed and the enzyme will no longer be able to carry out its function.6) The tertiary structure of an enzyme may be altered by changes in pH or temperature (see next page).7) The primary structure (amino acid sequence) of a protein is determined by a gene. If a mutation occurs in that gene (see p. 91), it could change the tertiary structure of the enzyme produced.Practice QuestionsQ1 What is an enzyme?Q2 What is the name given to the amount of energy needed to start a reaction?Q3 What is an enzyme-substrate complex?Q4 Why can an enzyme only bind to one substance?[4 marks] [2 marks]Exam QuestionsQ1 Dcscribc the \u2018induced fit\u2019 model of enzyme action.Q2 Explain how a change in the amino acid sequence of an enzyme may prevent it from functioning properly.But why is the enzyme-substrate complex?So enzymes lower the activation energy of a reaction. I like to think of it as an assault course (bear with me). Suppose the assault course starts with a massive wall \u2014 enzymes are like the person who gives you a leg up over the wall (see?). Without it you'd need lots of energy to get over the wall yourself and complete the rest of the course.

Most multicellular organisms (mammals, insects, fish) have a circulatory system of some type.The Circulatory System is a Mass Transport System1) Multicellular organisms, like mammals, have a low surface area to volume ratio (see p. 54), so they need a specialised transport system to carry raw materials from specialised exchange organs to their body cells \u2014 this is the circulatory system.2) The circulatory system is made up of the heart and blood vessels.3) The heart pumps blood through blood vessels (arteries,arterioles, veins and capillaries) to reach different parts of the body. You need to know the names of all the bloodvessels entering and leaving the heart, lungs and kidneys.-4) Blood transports respiratory gases, products of digestion, metabolic wastes and hormones round the body.There are two circuits.One circuit takes blood from the heart to the lungs, then back to the heart.The other loop takes blood around the rest of the body.

Some protein molecules \nare joined with (conjugated to) another molecule called a prosthetic group (see fig\u00a0F). This structural feature usually affects the performance and functions of  the molecules. These molecules are called conjugated proteins. Haemoglobin is a large protein with iron as the prosthetic group. It is a conjugated protein as well as a globular protein. Lipoproteins are formed when proteins are conjugated with lipids \u2013 you will find out more about these important biological molecules when you look at factors affecting the health of  your heart in Chapter 1B.\nGlycoproteins are proteins with a carbohydrate prosthetic group. The carbohydrate part of  the \nmolecule helps them to hold a lot of  water and also makes it harder for protein-digesting enzymes (proteases) to break them down. Lots of  lubricants used by the human body \u2013 such as mucus and the synovial fluid in the joints \u2013 are glycoproteins. Their water-holding properties make them slippery and viscous, which reduces friction. This also helps to explain why the mucus produced in the stomach protects the protein walls from digestion.\nLipoproteins are very important in the transport of  cholesterol in the blood. The lipid part of  the \nmolecule enables it to combine with the lipid cholesterol. There are two main forms of  lipoproteins in your blood \u2013 low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) (around 22\n nm in diameter) and high-density \nlipopr\noteins (HDLs) (approximately 8\u201311\n nm in diameter). T\nhe HDLs contain more protein than \nLDLs, which is partly why they are denser \u2013 proteins are more compact molecules than lipids.

If heart muscle doesn't receive enough oxygen it can lead to a heart attack(see previous page).4) Smoking also decreases the amount of antioxidants in the blood \u2014 these are important for protecting cells from damage. Fewer antioxidants means cell damage in the coronary artery walls is more likely, and this can lead to atheroma formation.High blood pressure1) High blood pressure increases the risk of damage to the artery walls.2) Damaged walls have an increased risk of atheroma formation, causing a further increase in blood pressure.3) Atheromas can also cause blood clots to form (see previous page).4) A blood clot could block flow of blood to the heart muscle, possibly resulting in myocardial infarction.5) So anything that increases blood pressure also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, e.g. being overweight, not exercising and excessive alcohol consumption.~ ^ther factors include age ' - (risk increases with age) ~ 5 and sex (men are more at E -v risk than women) - IW||VV\"Most of these factors are within our control \u2014 a person can choose to smoke, eat fatty foods, etc. However, some risk factors can't be controlled, such as having a genetic predisposition to coronary heart disease or having high blood pressure as a result of another condition, e.g. some forms of diabetes. Even so, the risk of developing cardiovascular disease can be reduced by removing as many risk factors as you possibly can.Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n"}}
