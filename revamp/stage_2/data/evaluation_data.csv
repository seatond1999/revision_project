0,"29 1B.1 THE PRINCIPLES OF CIRCULATION MAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS
THE NEED FOR TRANSPORT IN MULTICELLULAR 
ANIMALS
Within a large multicellular organism, many chemical reactions 
take place inside every microscopic cell. These cells require a supply of  chemical substances such as glucose and oxygen for cellular respiration. These must be transported from outside a large organism into the cells. Respiration supplies energy for the other reactions of  life, but it also produces the toxic waste product carbon dioxide. This and other waste products need to be removed from the cells before they cause damage to them. 
Large multicellular organisms have internal transport systems that 
carry substances to every cell in the body. These systems deliver oxygen and nutrients and remove waste so that cells can carry out their functions efficiently. In large complex animals such as humans, chemicals made in a cell in one part of  the body – such as a hormone like insulin or adrenaline – may influence a different type of  cell elsewhere in the body. So substances made internally need to be moved around the body as well.
In many animals, including all the vertebrates, this transport 
system is the heart and circulatory system and the fluid that flows through it. This is an example of  a mass transport system – substances are transported in the flow of  a fluid with a mechanism for moving it around the body. All large complex organisms have some form of  mass transport system which overcomes the limits of  diffusion between the internal and external environments. Substances are delivered over short distances from the mass transport system to individual cells deep in the body by processes such as diffusion, osmosis and active transport.
FEATURES OF MASS TRANSPORT SYSTEMS
Mass transport systems are very effective for moving substances around the body. Most mass transport systems have certain features which are the same. They have:
 •e
xchange surfaces to get materials into and out of  the transport 
system
 •a system of
 vessels that carry substances – these are usually 
tubes, sometimes following a very specific route, sometimes widespread and branching
 •a w
ay of  making sure that substances are moved in the right 
direction (e.g. nutrients in and waste out)
 •a w
ay of  moving materials fast enough to supply the needs 
of  the organism – this may involve mechanical methods such as the pumping of  the heart or ways of  maintaining a concentration gradient so that substances move quickly from one place to another (e.g. using active transport)
 •a suita
ble transport medium (e.g. fluid)
 •in man
y cases, a way of  adapting the rate of  transport to the 
needs of  the organism.
CIRCULATION SYSTEMS
Many animals have a circulatory system in which a heart pumps blood around the body. Insects have an open circulatory system with the blood circulating in large open spaces. However, most larger animals, including mammals, have a closed circulatory system with the blood contained within tubes. The blood makes a continuous journey out to the most distant parts of  the body and back to the heart.
LEARNING TIP
The main advantages of a closed system are:
• the pressure can be increased to make the blood flow more quickly
• the flow can be directed more precisely to the organs that need 
most oxygen and nutrients.
Animals such as fish have a single circulation system (see fig 
C). The heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the gills, the organs 
of  gas exchange where the blood takes in oxygen (becomes oxygenated) and gives up carbon dioxide at the same time. The blood then travels on around the rest of  the body of  the fish, giving up oxygen to the body cells before returning to the heart.

LEARNING TIP
Remember that mass flow is like a stream with all the components 
flowing together.
Birds and mammals need much more oxygen than fish. Not 
only do they have to move around without the support of  water, but they also maintain a constant body temperature that may be higher or lower than their surroundings. This takes a lot of  resources, so their cells need plenty of  oxygen and glucose and make waste products that need to be removed quickly. Birds and mammals have evolved the most complex type of  transport system, known as a double circulation because it involves two separate circulation systems. The systemic circulation carries oxygenated blood (oxygen-rich blood) from the heart to the cells of  the body where the oxygen is used. It also carries the deoxygenated blood (blood that has given up its oxygen to the body cells) back to the heart. The pulmonary circulation carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs to be oxygenated and then carries the oxygenated blood back to the heart (see fig D).
The separate circuits of  a double circulatory system ensure that 
the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood cannot mix, so the tissues receive as much oxygen as possible. Another big advantage is that the fully oxygenated blood can be delivered quickly to the body tissues at high pressure. The blood going through the tiny blood vessels in the lungs is at relatively low pressure, so it does

▲ fig B  Healthy r ed blood cells have a biconcave disc shape.
LEUCOCYTES (WHITE BLOOD CELLS)
Leucocytes or white blood cells are much larger than 
erythrocytes, but can also squeeze through tiny blood vessels because they can change their shape. There are around 4000–11
 
000 per mm3 of  blood and there are several different types. 
They are made in the bone marrow, although some mature in the thymus gland. Their main function is to defend the body against infection. Leucocytes are also very important in the inflammatory response of  the body when an area of  tissue is damaged. They all contain a nucleus and have colourless cytoplasm, although some types contain granules which can be stained. There are several different types of  leucocyte, which you will study further in  Book 2 Chapter 6B. 
PLATELETS
Platelets are tiny fragments of  large cells called megakaryocytes, which are found in the bone marrow. There are about 150
 000–400
 000 pla
telets per mm3 of  blood. They are 
involved in blood clotting (see page 35).
TRANSPORT OF OXYGEN
The many haemoglobin molecules that are in the red blood cells transport oxygen. Each haemoglobin molecule is a large globular protein consisting of  four peptide chains, each with an iron-containing prosthetic group. Each group can collect four molecules of  oxygen in a reversible process to form oxyhaemoglobin:
   Hb + 4O2 ⇋ Hb.4O2   ____________________________________     haemoglobin + oxygen ⇋ oxyhaemoglobin     
T
he first oxygen molecule that binds to the haemoglobin changes 
the arrangement of  the molecule making it easier for the following oxygen molecules to bind. The final oxygen molecule binds several hundred times faster than the first. The same process happens in reverse when oxygen dissociates from haemoglobin – it gets progressively harder to remove the oxygen.
EXAM HINT
Always use suitable scientific terms. This is important because it can 
help to focus a response clearly.
When the blood enters the lungs, the concentration of  oxygen 
in the red blood cells is relatively low. Oxygen moves into the red blood cells from the air in the lungs by diffusion. The oxygen is collected and bound to the haemoglobin, so the free oxygen concentration in the cytoplasm of  the red blood cells stays low. This maintains a steep concentration gradient from the air in the lungs to the red blood cells, so more and more oxygen diffuses in and joins onto the haemoglobin.The oxygen levels are relatively low in the body tissues. The concentration of  oxygen in the cytoplasm of  the red blood cells is higher than in the surrounding tissue. As a result, oxygen moves out into the body cells by diffusion down its concentration gradient. The haemoglobin molecules give up some of  their oxygen. When you are at rest or exercising gently, only about 25% of  the oxygen carried by the haemoglobin is released into your cells. There is another 75% in reserve in the transport system for when you are very active.
The strong affinity of  haemoglobin for oxygen means that a 
small change in the proportion of  oxygen in the surrounding environment can have a big effect on the saturation of  the blood with oxygen. So in the lungs, the haemoglobin rapidly gains oxygen and in the tissues, as the oxygen saturation of  the environment falls, oxygen is released rapidly (see fig C).

TRANSPORT OF CARBON DIOXIDE
Waste carbon dioxide diffuses from the respiring cells of  the 
body tissues into the blood along a concentration gradient. The reaction of  the carbon dioxide with water is crucial. When carbon dioxide is dissolved in the blood it reacts slowly with the water to form carbonic acid, H
2CO3. The carbonic acid separates to form 
hydrogen ions H+ and hydrogencarbonate ions HCO3–:
CO2 + H2O ⇋ H2CO3 ⇋ HCO3– + H+
About 5% of  the carbon dioxide is carried in solution in the plasma. A further 10–20% combines with haemoglobin molecules to make carbaminohaemoglobin. Most of  the carbon dioxide is transported in the cytoplasm of  the red blood cells as hydrogencarbonate ions. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase controls the rate of  the reaction between carbon dioxide and water to produce carbonic acid.
In the body tissues, there is a high concentration of  carbon dioxide 
in the blood, so carbonic anhydrase catalyses the formation of  carbonic acid.

2,"MAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS 42 1B.4 THE MAMMALIAN HEART
THE ACTION OF THE HEART
EXAM HINT
When describing the action of the heart, remember that blood flows 
through both sides at the same time. Make it clear that both atria pump at the same time and both ventricles pump at the same time.
1 T he inferior vena cava collects deoxygenated blood from the 
lower parts of  the body, while the superior vena cava receives 
deoxygenated blood from the head, neck, arms and chest. Deoxygenated blood is delivered to the right atrium.
2
 T
he right atrium receives the blood from the great veins. As it 
fills with blood, the pressure builds up and opens the tricuspid valve, so the right ventricle starts to fill with blood too. When the atrium is full it contracts, forcing more blood into the ventricle. The atrium has thin muscular walls because it receives blood at low pressure from the inferior vena cava and the superior vena cava and it needs to exert relatively little pressure to move the blood into the ventricle. One-way semilunar valves (like the valves in veins described in Section 1B.3) at the entrance to the atrium stop a backflow of  blood into the veins.
3
 
The tricuspid valve consists of  three flaps and is also 
known as an atrioventricular valve because it separates an atrium from a ventricle. The valve allows blood to pass from the atrium to the ventricle, but not in the other direction. The tough tendinous cords, also known as valve tendons or heartstrings, make sure the valves are not turned inside out by the pressure exerted when the ventricles contract.
4
 T
he right ventricle is filled with blood under some pressure 
when the right atrium contracts, then the ventricle contracts. Its muscular walls produce the pressure needed to force blood out of  the heart into the pulmonary arteries. These carry the deoxygenated blood to the capillaries in the lungs. As the ventricle starts to contract, the tricuspid valve closes to prevent blood flowing into the atrium. Semilunar valves, like those in veins, prevent the blood flowing back from the arteries into the ventricle.
5
 T
he blood returns from the lungs to the left side of  the heart in 
the pulmonary veins. The blood is at relatively low pressure after passing through the extensive capillaries of  the lungs. The blood returns to the left atrium, another thin-walled chamber that performs the same function as the right atrium. It contracts to force blood into the left ventricle. Backflow is prevented by another atrioventricular valve known as the bicuspid valve , which has only two flaps.
6
 As the left a
trium contracts, the bicuspid valve opens and the 
left ventricle is filled with blood under pressure. As the left ventricle starts to contract the bicuspid valve closes to prevent backflow of  blood to the left atrium. The left ventricle pumps the blood out of  the heart and into the aorta, the major artery of  the body. This carries blood away from the heart at even higher pressure than the major arteries that branch off  from it. 
The muscular wall of  the left side of  the heart is much thicker than that of  the right. The right side pumps blood to the lungs, which are relatively close to the heart. The delicate capillaries of  the lungs need blood delivered at relatively low pressure. The left side must produce sufficient force to move the blood under pressure to all the extremities of  the body and overcome the elastic recoil of  the arteries. Semilunar valves prevent the blood flowing back from the aorta into the ventricle.
LEARNING TIP
Remember that the valves do not operate on their own. They open 
and close as blood pressure changes in the chambers on either side of the valve. When the pressure is higher on one side it will push the valve open. When it is higher on the other side, it will close the valve.
The septum is a thick wall of  muscle and connective tissue 
between the two sides of  the heart. It prevents the oxygenated blood mixing with the deoxygenated blood. 
DID YOU KNOW? 
In an embryo, there is a gap in the septum called the foramen ovale and the blood from the two sides of the heart can mix. This does not matter because the lungs of the fetus do not function and little blood flows to them. At birth, this hole closes over as the lungs begin to function. If it does not, the baby has a condition called patent foramen ovale or ‘hole in the heart’ . This may be  so small it does not really matter. If it is large, it must be closed  by surgery.
DID YOU KNOW? 
Inside the heart
The diagrams we use of the inside of a mammalian heart make it 
look very clean and simple (see fig A). But when you dissect the heart of a mammal such as a sheep or a cow, you can see that it is much more complicated. Cutting open a heart and exploring the connections between the blood vessels and the chambers of the heart, and seeing the structure of the valves, helps you understand how it works as a three-dimensional pump (see fig C).

3,"45 1B.5 ATHEROSCLEROSIS MAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS
Once damage to the endothelium has occurred, the body’s inflammatory response begins and 
white blood cells arrive at the site of  the damage. These cells accumulate chemicals from the blood, especially cholesterol. This leads to a plaque (also known as an atheroma) forming on the endothelial lining of  the artery (see fig C). Fibrous tissue and calcium salts also build up (increase in amount) around the atheroma, turning it into a hardened plaque. This hardened area means that part of  the artery wall is less elastic and narrower than it should be. This is atherosclerosis and is summarised in fig B.
The plaque causes the lumen of  the artery to become much smaller. This increases the blood 
pressure, making it harder for the heart to pump blood around the body. The raised blood pressure makes damage more likely in other areas of  the endothelial lining and more plaques will form.  This will make the blood pressure even higher, and so the problem gets worse. There are many factors that are linked to the development of  atherosclerosis. Y ou will look at these in more detail  in Chapter 1C.
EFFECT OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS ON HEALTH
Atherosclerosis can have many serious effects on the health of  an individual. The development  of  atherosclerosis can be summarised as: damage to the endothelium of  the arteries → inflammatory response → accumulation of  cholesterol → atheroma → fibrous tissue/calcium salts → plaque → narrowing/loss of  elasticity of  the artery.
ANEURYSMS
If  an area of  an artery is narrowed by plaque, blood tends to collect behind the blockage. The artery bulges and the wall is put under more pressure than usual, so it becomes weakened. This is known as an aneurysm. The weakened artery wall may split open, leading to massive internal bleeding. Aneurysms frequently happen in the blood vessels supplying the brain or in the aorta, especially when it passes through the abdomen. The massive blood loss and drop in blood pressure are often fatal, but if  aneurysms are diagnosed they can be treated by surgery before they burst.
RAISED BLOOD PRESSURE
The arteries narrowed due to plaques on the walls cause raised blood pressure. This can lead to severe damage in a number of  organs, including the kidneys, the eyes and the brain. The high pressure damages the tiny blood vessels where your kidney filters out urea and other substances from the blood. If  the vessels feeding the kidney tubules become narrowed, the pressure inside them gets even higher and proteins may be forced out through their walls. If  you have high blood pressure, your doctors can test for protein in your urine as a sign of  kidney damage. 
Similarly, the tiny blood vessels supplying the retina of  your eye are easily damaged. If  they become 
blocked or leak, the retinal cells are starved of  oxygen and die and this can cause blindness. 
Bleeding from the capillaries into the brain results in one type of  stroke (see below).
HEART DISEASE
There are many kinds of  heart disease, but the two most common ones are angina and myocardial 
infarction (heart attack); both are closely linked to atherosclerosis (see figs B and D ).
In angina, plaques build up slowly in the coronary arteries, reducing blood flow to the parts of  the heart muscle beyond the plaques. Often symptoms are first noticed during exercise, when the cardiac muscle is working harder and needs more oxygen. The narrowed coronary arteries cannot supply enough oxygenated blood and the heart muscle resorts to anaerobic respiration. This causes a gripping pain in the chest that can extend into the arms, particularly the left one, and the jaw, and often also causes breathlessness. The symptoms of  angina subside once exercise stops, but the experience is painful and frightening.
Fortunately, most angina is relatively mild. It can be helped by taking regular exercise, losing weight 
and not smoking. The symptoms can be treated by drugs that cause rapid dilation of  the coronary blood vessels so that they supply the cardiac muscle with the oxygen it needs. However, if  the blockage of  the coronary arteries continues to get worse, so will the symptoms of  the angina. Other drugs are then used to dilate the blood vessels and reduce the heart rate. Unfortunately, drugs cannot

ANTIOXIDANTS AND HEART HEALTH
However, as you know, it isn’t enough to show a correlation between two things. We need to show 
how one thing causes another and we still don’t really know how fruit and vegetables have their effect. They are very varied in their chemistry. For some time, it was thought that the antioxidants found in fruit and vegetables might be the answer. Vitamins, such as vitamin A found in carrots, vitamin C from citrus fruits and vitamin E from leafy green vegetables, almonds and sunflower oil, are antioxidants and they are found in fruits and vegetables. Several studies appeared to show that antioxidants were the answer and many people started taking antioxidant supplements to protect their hearts. However, recent studies, including some very large metadata analyses (studies where scientists have looked at the results of  many different investigations), have shown that the evidence for antioxidants being good for your heart is inconclusive. There is some evidence that some antioxidants may cause harm.
VITAMIN C: A CASE STUDY
Vitamin C is important in the formation of  connective tissue in the body, such as in the bones, teeth, skin and many internal body surfaces including the endothelial lining of  blood vessels. A severe lack of  vitamin C in the diet causes scurvy, which can result in bleeding gums, bruising easily and painful joints. As you have seen, if  the lining of  an artery is damaged, atherosclerosis is more likely to develop. So, it makes sense, in theory, that if  your diet is low in vitamin C, your arteries are more likely to be damaged and you are more likely to be affected by CVD. 
A study published in the British Medical Journal in 1997 looked at the association between 
concentration of  vitamin C in the blood and risk of  heart attack in 1605 men from eastern Finland. The men had no sign of  coronary artery disease when they were tested between 1984 and 1989. Their vitamin C levels were also tested. Between 1984 and 1992 a total 70 of  the men had a heart EXAM HINT

REFERENCE1.19 6 USING THE EVIDENCE
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
◼ Under stand how people use scientific knowledge about the effects of diet, including obesity indicators, exercise and 
smoking to reduce their risk of coronary heart disease.
There is much scientific evidence about the main factors that increase the risk of  heart disease. 
A lot of  that evidence is used by governments and health organisations to produce advice on how to improve our health. Why do they do this? 
PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE 
Cardiovascular disease has a negative effect on individuals, on families  and on society. It costs a lot of  money to treat people in hospital. When  people are too ill to work, they are losing money for their families, and  also for the companies where they work. Treating people with drugs to  prevent them from needing surgery is cheaper for health service providers.  It is even cheaper (and better for the individual) if  we can stop ourselves  needing the drugs. So, prevention is better than treatment for CVDs for  many reasons (see fig A). However, persuading people to change their  
lifestyle habits is often difficult.
For example, there is a lot of  reliable evidence to show that smoking is  
one of  the highest risk factors for CVDs. However, if  you stop smoking,  your risk of  developing heart disease is almost halved after just one year.  Moreover, research carried out by a team led by Azra Mahmud from  Trinity College Dublin and published in 2007 suggests that after 10 years,  the arteries of  smokers who stop smoking are the same as if  they had  never smoked. There is a lot of  support available for people who want to  stop smoking. Y et, despite all this, almost 1 billion people around the  world smoke cigarettes and millions of  them die each year of  CVDs and  cancers linked to their smoking. 
Health education programmes in schools and communities can help to  
make sure that everyone is aware of  the risks associated with different  lifestyle choices. However, each individual has to make their own choices  and take their own risks.
OVERWEIGHT OR UNDERFIT?
Most people are aware that obesity is linked to CVDs, and many go on  slimming diets to try to lose weight. Most people also know that taking  regular exercise helps protect against CVDs – but more people choose to  go on a diet than choose to take regular exercise. The results of  a study  carried out over an average of  eight years on 20
 000 men a
ged from  
30 to 83 years are given in Section 1C.4 fig B. Fitness was defined by  how much oxygen they used during exercise. The results show that if  you  are obese and fit you have a lower risk of  dying from CVDs than someone  who is not obese but unfit. Obviously, being the correct weight and fit is  best of  all! 
The problem is that many people enjoy their food, and don’t take sufficient exercise. It takes a lot of  
effort to cut down the amount of  food you eat and change to eating healthier foods including lots of  fruit and vegetables. ▲

sickness or other causes of absenteeism.
■ The e ff iciency of employees can be assessed before they are

■ By using teleworking  from home for some groups of

KEY TERMS
Advantages for the workers with part-time and 
flexible contracts
■ This contract could be ideal for certain types of workers, 
for example parents with young children, students or more 
elderly people who do not wish to work a full week.
■ They may be able to combine jobs with di ff erent firms, 
giving greater variety to their working lives.
Th ere are potential disadvantages too.
Disadvantages for the business
■ There will be more employees to manage than if they were 
all full-time.
■ Eff ective communication will become much more 
diff icult, not just because there will be more sta ff  in total 
but also because it may be impossible to hold meetings 
with all the sta ff  at any one time. There could be greater 
reliance on written communication methods because 
of this.
■ Motivation levels may be adversely a ff ected because 
part-time sta ff  may feel less involved and committed to 
the business than full-time workers. It will be much more 
diff icult to establish a teamwork culture if all the sta ff  
never actually meet each other because of their di ff erent 
working hours.
■ Workers may have more than one zero hours contract 
with di ff erent employers and they may not be available 
immediately if they are called on to work.Disadvantages for the workers
■ They will be earning less than full-time workers.
■ They may be paid at a lower rate than full-time workers.
■ The security of employment and other working 
conditions are o ft en inferior to those of full-time workers. 
This is now changing in some countries. In all of the states 
of the European Union for example, the law now gives 
as many employment rights to part-time as to full-time 
workers. This is still not the case in other regions of 
the world.
Temporary contracts
Off ering temporary employment contracts is another way 
fi rms use to reduce the overhead costs of employing sta ff  
when there may be less demand for them. Lower levels of 
job security can mean that safety needs, as identi fi ed by 
Maslow, may not be satis fi ed and this will have a negative 
eff ect on motivation. Temporary contracts can be either 
full-time or part-time. Th ey are contracts for fi xed periods 
of time as opposed to permanent contracts. Permanent 
contracts end only when a worker is sacked (for example 
for poor discipline), made redundant (for example when 
demand has fallen) or leaves of their own accord. Th e 
advantages and drawbacks of temporary contracts are 
similar to those of part-time contracts, especially the 
bene fi t of fl exibility o ff ered to employers. Such fl exibility is 
particularly important to seasonal business activities, such 
as fruit picking.

gives fi rms the chance to create a small team of full-time 
staff , called core workers, and combine this with a number 
of fl exible workers, who are employed only as and when 
necessary. Th is is further enhanced by the increasing 
trend towards outsourcing  – using outside self-employed 
contractors to perform speci fi c jobs within the business 
rather than employing sta ff  directly . Th e three types of 
contracts are termed ‘peripheral’ workers as they are not part 
of the central core of full-time employees (see Figure  13.1).

2 Collective bargaining between trade unions and 
major employers and their associations
Collective bargaining is when representatives of unions 
and national employers negotiate wage levels and working 
conditions for the whole industry or for large sections of 
it. Th ese collective negotiations made trade union leaders 
very powerful as they were able to threaten and actually 
call for strike action from all of their members and this 
could bring the entire industry to a halt.
Evaluation:
■ National agreements were not always suitable, or 
aff ordable, for smaller businesses.
■ Strikes and other industrial action caused disruption and 
lost output and sales.
■ Powerful unions resisted any changes that might adversely 
aff ect their members and this led to a lack of investment in, 
and development of, key industries.
3 Cooperation between labour and management
Th is approach is based on the recognition that successful 
competitive businesses will bene fi t all parties. Recent 
management thinking has been not to seek to oppose 
workers’ suggestions and those of their union leaders, but 
to actively involve them in important decision-making and 
operational issues. In much of modern industry, therefore, 
there is much less confrontation, far fewer strikes and a 
great deal more harmony and working towards common 
goals than there was in the 1960s and 1970s.
It is a commonly held view, at least in developed 
economies, that labour −management relations, based on 
mutual respect, understanding and common aims, are 
likely to lead to a competitive and productive business that 
will be able to survive the added strains of a globalised 
economy. Indeed, participation and employee involvement 
could become a signi fi cant factor determining the long-term 
success of business in rapidly changing market conditions.
Reasons for and role of a workforce plan
HR departments need to calculate the future sta ffi  ng needs 
of the business. Failure to do this can lead to too few or too 
many sta ff  or sta ff  with the wrong skills. HR departments 
must work in close harmony with the corporate plan of 
the business and the objectives this contains. If the overall 
business plan is to expand production and develop products 
for foreign markets, then this must be re fl ected in the workforce plan  – which becomes part of the fi rm’s strategy 
to meet its long-term goals. So, workforce planning  means 
thinking ahead and establishing the number and skills 
of the workforce required by the business in the future to 
meet its planned objectives. Th e s e  t w o  f a c t o r s  n e e d  c a r e f u l  
thought and the starting point is always a workforce audit .
Workforce planning: analysing and forecasting the 
numbers of workers and the skills of those workers that will 
be required by the organisation to achieve its objectives.
Workforce audit: a check on the skills and qualifications 
of all existing workers/managers.
KEY TERMS
Once this has been conducted, the next stages in 
workforce planning are to assess how many additional 
employees and skills might be needed.
1 The number of employees
Th e number of employees required in the future depends 
on many factors:
■ Forecast demand for the firm’s product:  This will be 
influenced by market and external conditions, seasonal 
factors, competitors’ actions, trends in consumer tastes 
and so on. It could be a mistake to replace a worker who 
decides to leave the firm if consumer demand is falling 
or if there is likely to be a seasonal downturn in demand. 
Demand forecasts may be necessary to help establish 
workforce planning needs, but we know that these are 
subject to margins of error. For this reason, some firms 
allow some additional sta ff ing to be built into the plan to 
allow for unplanned increases in demand. An alternative 
might be to recruit temporary or part-time sta ff  with 
flexible hours’ contracts  – this issue is studied in more 
detail later.
■ The productivity levels of sta ff : I f  p r o d u c t i v i t y  ( o u t p u t  p e r  
worker) is forecast to increase  – perhaps as a result of more 
eff icient machinery  – then fewer sta ff  will be needed to 
produce the same level of output.
■ The objectives of the business:  This could influence future 
workforce numbers in two main ways. Firstly, if the business 
plans to expand over the coming years, then sta ff i n g  n u m be rs 
will have to rise to accommodate this growth. Secondly, if the 
firm intends to increase customer-service levels, possibly at 
the expense of short-term profits, then more workers might 
need to be recruited. A workforce plan cannot be devised 
without consideration of business objectives.
■ Changes in the law regarding workers’ rights:  If the 
government of a country decides to pass laws that establish 
a shorter maximum working week or introduce a minimum 
wage level, then there will be a considerable impact on 
the workforce plan. A shorter working week might lead to 178Cambridge International AS and A Level Business"

■ limited liability
■ separate legal identity
■ continuity
■ ease of buying and selling of shares 
for shareholders  – this encourages 
investment in plcs
■ access to substantial capital sources due 
to the ability to issue a prospectus to the 
public and to o ff er shares for sale (called 
a flotation)■ legal formalities in formation
■ cost of business consultants and financial advisers when creating such a 
company
■ share prices subject to fluctuation  – sometimes for reasons beyond business 
control, for example state of the economy
■ legal requirements concerning disclosure of information to shareholders and 
the public, for example annual publication of detailed report and accounts
■ risk of takeover due to the availability of the shares on the stock exchange
■ directors influenced by short-term objectives of major investors
Table 2.5 Advantages and disadvantages of public limited companies
to shareholders. Knowing the maximum share capital 
means that the relative importance of any one share can 
be determined. Being aware of the company’s aims means 
that shareholders can avoid businesses that may operate in 
markets and products  – such as weapons  – that they may 
not want to be associated with.

Association .
Articles of Association: this document covers the internal 
workings and control of the business  – for example, the 
names of directors and the procedures to be followed at 
meetings will be detailed.
KEY TERM
When these documents have been completed satisfactorily, 
the registrar of companies will issue a certi fi cate of 
incorporation. Private limited companies may now 
begin trading. In addition, to gain a listing on the stock 
exchange, which as explained above will greatly increase 
the marketability of shares, the accounts and trading 
record of the business will be carefully scrutinised by the 
stock exchange.
Other forms of business organisation
Cooperatives
Th ese are a very common form of organisation in some 
countries, especially in agriculture and retailing. It is 
common to di ff erentiate between producer or worker 
cooperatives that are involved with making goods and 
consumer or retail cooperatives that sell goods and 
services. Certain features are common to all cooperatives:
■ All members can contribute to the running of the 
business,  sharing the workload, responsibilities and 
decision-making, although in larger cooperatives some 
delegation to professional managers takes place.■ All members have one vote at important meetings.
■ Profits are shared equally among members.
In agricultural cooperatives, the members arrange for 
the purchase of seeds and materials in bulk so that they 
may bene fi t from economies of scale. Th e  c o o p e r a t i v e  
oft en buys the produce of the members and then sells it 
collectively in order to obtain a better price.
Th e advantages of such business units are:
■ b u y i n g  i n  b u l k
■ working together to solve problems and take decisions
■ good motivation for all members to work hard as they will 
benefit from shared profits.
Th e potential drawbacks can include:
■ poor management skills, unless professional managers 
are employed
■ capital shortages because no sale of shares to the non-
member general public is allowed
■ slow decision-making if all members are to be consulted 
on important issues.
Franchises
A franchise  is not strictly a form of legal structure for a 
business, but it is a legal contract between two fi rms.
Franchise: a business that uses the name, logo and 
trading systems of an existing successful business.

9,"So cash fl ow is certainly important  – especially to small 
business start-ups. Cash- fl ow planning is vital for 
entrepreneurs because:
■ new business start-ups are o ft en o ff ered much less time to 
pay suppliers than larger, well-established firms  – they are 
given shorter credit periods
■ banks and other lenders may not believe the promises of 
new business owners as they have no trading record, they 
will expect payment at the agreed time
■ finance is o ft en very tight at start-up, so not planning 
accurately is of even more significance for new businesses.
Clearly, the consequences of not having a suitable level of 
cash in the business can be very serious  – or even life-
threatening for that business.
Cash and profit  – what’s the di ff e r e n c e ?
For many failed business owners there was no di ff erence 
between cash and pro fi t – which is why their business 
collapsed. All successful entrepreneurs and business 
managers, in contrast, understand that these two fi nancial 
concepts do not have the same meaning or signi fi cance for a 
business  – especially a newly formed one. It is very common 
for pro fi table businesses to run short of cash. On the other 
hand, loss-making businesses can have high cash in fl ows  
in the short term. Th e  e s s e n t i a l  d i ff erence between cash and 
profi t can be explained with three simple examples:
Example 1:  Jhumpa buys fresh fi sh from a market every 
day. She pays cash to the traders and gets a good deal 
because of this. She sells all of her stock on a high-street 
stall to shoppers who also pay her cash.
■ In a typical week Jhumpa buys fish costing $1,000 and sells 
it for $2,000.
■ How much profit does she make in a typical week (ignore 
other costs)? $1,000.
■ What was the di ff erence between her cash inflows and 
outflows in a typical week? $1,000 too  – as all purchases 
and sales were in cash.
■ In this very simplified example, cash = profit at the end of 
the week (but we have ignored other expenses too).
Cash inflows: payments in cash received by a business, 
such as those from customers (trade receivables) or from 
the bank, e.g. receiving a loan.
Cash outflows: payments in cash made by a business, 
such as those to suppliers and workers.
KEY TERMS
Example 2:  Shula owns Fine Foods, a specialist 
delicatessen. Last month she bought $500 of fresh goods 
from a supplier who o ff ers her one month’s credit. Th e goods sold very slowly during the month and she was 
forced to cut her prices several times. Eventually she sold 
them all for only $300, paid in cash by her customers.
■ What was her profit or loss (ignoring all other costs)? A loss 
of $200  – because even though she has not yet paid for the 
goods they are still recorded as a cost.
■ What was the di ff erence between her cash outflow and 
inflow? A positive inflow $300  – because she has not paid the 
supplier yet. So Shula has a positive cash flow from these 
goods this month even though she made a loss on them.
■ Cash was not the same as profit for this business.
Example 3:  Sanjit is concerned about competition for his 
jewellery shop. He buys most of his stock over the Internet 
for cash  – but has decided to increase the credit terms 
he gives to his customers to two months. Last month he 
bought some rings for $3,000 and paid in cash. He sold 
them all in the same month for $7,000– yet will not receive 
payment until two months’ time.
■ How much profit did he make on these rings? $4,000  – the 
rings have been sold and revenue recorded from the sale 
even though no cash payment has been made.
■ What was Sanjit’s cash-flow position from these deals? 
A negative outflow of $3,000  – he may be very short of 
cash until he receives payment from his customers.
■ Cash was not the same as profit for this business  – and 
there is a real danger that it could run out of cash to pay its 
everyday costs, such as wages and rent.
TOP TIP
When given the opportunity, emphasise the importance 
of having enough cash in the short term. Profit can wait 
to be earned in the long term  – but cash payments are 
always being made.
How to forecast cash flow
Forecasting cash fl ow means trying to estimate future cash 
infl ows and cash out fl ows, usually on a month-by-month 
basis. Let’s take the case of Mohammed, an entrepreneur 
planning to open a car-valeting service aiming to o ff er car 
cleaning to individual customers and owners of car fl eets, 
such as taxi fi rms.
Forecasting cash inflows
Where to start? Th e business owner will probably attempt 
to forecast cash in fl ows fi rst. Some of these will be easier to 
forecast than others. Here are some example cash in fl ows 
and how they might be forecast:
■ Owner’s own capital injection: This will be easy to forecast 
as this is under Mohammed’s direct control.46531: Forecasting and managing cash flows  "

HYDROGEN BONDS
Y ou were introduced to hydrogen bonds in Section 1A.1. These same bonds are essential in protein 
structures. In amino acids, tiny negative charges are present on the oxygen of  the carboxyl groups and tiny positive charges are present on the hydrogen atoms of  the amino groups. When these charged groups are close to each other, the opposite charges attract, forming a hydrogen bond. Hydrogen bonds are weak but, potentially, they can be made between any two amino acids in the correct position, so there are many of  them holding the protein together very firmly. They are very important in the folding and coiling of  polypeptide chains (see fig C). Hydrogen bonds break easily and reform if  pH or temperature conditions change.
DISULFIDE BONDS
Disulfide bonds form when two cysteine molecules are close together in the structure of  a polypeptide (see fig C). An oxidation reaction occurs between the two sulfur-containing groups, resulting in a strong covalent bond known as a disulfide bond. These disulfide bonds are much stronger than hydrogen bonds but they happen much less often. They are important for holding the folded polypeptide chains in place.

▲ fig C  Hydr ogen bonds and disulfide bonds maintain the shape of protein molecules and this determines  
their function.
IONIC BONDS
Ionic bonds can form between some of  the strongly positive and negative amino acid side chains 
which are sometimes found deep inside the protein molecules. They are strong bonds, but they are not as common as the other structural bonds.
Y our hair is made of  the protein keratin. Some methods of  styling hair change the bonds within the protein 
molecules. Blow drying or straightening hair breaks the hydrogen bonds and temporarily reforms them with the hair curling in a different way until the hydrogen bonds reform in their original places.
Perming is a chemical treatment which is used in some hair salons to completely change the way hair 
looks for weeks or months. The chemicals break the disulfide bonds between the polypeptide chains and reform them in a different place. This effect is permanent – hair will stay styled in that particular way until it is cut off.
PROTEIN STRUCTURE
Proteins can be described by their primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure (see fig D). 
 •T
he primary structure of  a protein is the sequence of  amino acids that make up the polypeptide 
chain, held together by peptide bonds.
 •T
he secondary structure of  a protein is the arrangement of  the polypeptide chain into a regular, 
repeating three-dimensional (3D) structure, held together by hydrogen bonds. One example is the right-handed helix (α-helix), a spiral coil with the peptide bonds forming the backbone and the R groups protruding in all directions. Another is the ß-pleated sheet, in which the polypeptide chain folds into regular pleats held together by hydrogen bonds between the amino and carboxyl ends of  the amino acids. Most fibrous proteins have this type of  structure. Sometimes there is no regular secondary structure and the polypeptide forms a random coil.LEARNING TIP
Remember that fibrous proteins 
have a simpler structure and so tend to be more stable to changes in temperature and pH.
