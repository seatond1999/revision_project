A force–extension graph for a rubber band can be obtained in a similar 
manner to the experiment with the spring, but an alternative method is 
shown in Figure 13.7. Safety note:  It is important that safety glasses are 
worn to reduce the risk of eye damage when the band breaks. It is best to 
use a short, thin rubber band, as it will stretch to several times its original 
length and thick bands are difficult to break. To alter the length of the band, 
the boss is loosened and moved up the stand. The force at each extension is 
read off the newton-meter.
The rubber band stretches very easily at first, reaching a length of three or 
four times its original value (Figure 13.8). It then becomes very stiff and 
difficult to stretch as it approaches its breaking point.Figure 13.7 Stretching a rubber band.

Natural rubber is a polymer. It contains long chains of atoms that are normally 
tangled in a disordered fashion (like strands of spaghetti). Relatively small 
forces are needed to ‘untangle’ these molecules so a large extension is produced 
for small loads. When the chains are fully extended, additional forces need 
to stretch the bonds between the atoms, so much smaller extensions are 
produced for a given load; the rubber becomes stiffer.
It should be noted that the band returns to its original length if the force is 
removed at any stage prior to breaking – that is, the rubber band is elastic.
Force–compression graphs
Up to now we have considered only the behaviour of materials that have 
been subjected to stretching – or tensile  forces. If weights were placed on 
top of a large rectangular sponge, the sponge would be noticeably squashed 
and force–compression readings easily measured. This is much more difficult 
for metals. Whereas long thin samples of copper wire can be extended by 
several centimetres with tensile forces of 50  N or less, the shorter, thicker 
samples needed for compression tests require much larger forces to produce 
measurable compressions.
In engineering laboratories, large hydraulic presses are used, but a school’s 
compression testing kit, shown in Figure 13.9, can demonstrate the effects of 
compression on a range of sample materials.

Figure 14.9 shows a mass on a spring undergoing one complete oscillation 
and the positions of the mass after successive intervals of one quarter of a 
period. Halfway through the cycle, the mass is moving through the midpoint 
in the opposite direction to the starting position. The oscillations at these 
points are out of step with each other or ‘out of phase ’. Any two oscillations 
that are half a cycle out of step are said to be in antiphase . At the end of the 
cycle, the mass is moving through the midpoint in the same direction as at 
the start and the vibrations are now back in phase.Key term
The phase  of an oscillation refers to the 
position within a cycle that the particle 
occupies relative to the onset of the 
cycle.

Figure 14.9 Phases of an oscillation.
If you consider the oscillations in Figure 14.9 to be five separate masses, you 
will note that masses 1 and 5 are always in phase, mass 3 is in antiphase with 
both 1 and 5 and masses 2 and 4 are one quarter of a cycle and three quarters 
of a cycle out of phase with mass 1.
For a sinusoidal waveform, one cycle represents 2 π radians (360  °), so 
oscillations that are in antiphase are said to have a phase difference  of π 
radians (180  °), while those that differ by one quarter and three quarters of 
a cycle are π
2 radians (90  °) and 3π
2 radians (270  °) out of phase, respectively.
The phase relationships of masses 1–5 are represented on the displacement–
time graphs in Figure 14.10.

Imagine a water wave travelling along the surface of a glass-sided aquarium. 
A snapshot of the edge of the wave viewed through the glass would reveal a 
wave profile  showing the shape of the surface at that instant. This profile 
shows the positions of the particles along the surface at that time and can be

2," 14 Nature of waves 216Electric and magnetic fields will be studied in some detail in the Year 2 
Student’s book, but you should be aware that the fields do not require a 
material medium and that varying electric fields cannot exist without 
associated magnetic fields and vice versa. Electromagnetic waves can be 
detected when they pass over charged particles. Some of their energy is 
transferred to the particles, which makes them vibrate at the frequency of 
the wave.
Electromagnetic waves can also occur as a result of ‘quantum jumps’ of 
electrons in atoms or from ‘excited’ nuclei. The waves produced in this 
manner are emitted as photons , which are ‘bundles’ of waves of a few 
nanoseconds duration that have wavelengths dependent on their energy. The 
photon nature of light will be investigated in Chapter 17.
The complete range of electromagnetic waves and some of their properties 
are given in Table 14.1.
You will have come across this material during your GCSE studies, so this 
is a useful reminder!14.2 Electromagnetic waves
Mechanical waves are initiated by vibrating objects passing on some of their 
energy to the atoms or molecules of a material medium. Electromagnetic 
waves are created when charged particles are accelerated.
Radio waves are an example of electromagnetic radiation. Electrons in an aerial 
are made to oscillate using electronic circuitry, and this produces a wave of 
continuously varying electric and magnetic fields with the same frequency as the 
oscillator. The electric field variations are in the plane of the antenna, with the 
magnetic field in a plane at right angles to it, as shown in Figure 14.14.

3," 16 Superposition of waves 256Standing waves in strings
When a pulse is sent along a rope that is fixed at one end, the reflected pulse is 
out of phase with the incident pulse. A phase change of π radians (180  °) takes 
place at the point of reflection (Figure 16.12). This means that destructive 
interference will occur and the fixed position will (not surprisingly) be a node.
Standing waves in a string can be investigated using Melde’s experiment 
(Figure 16.13). A thin length of string is attached to an oscillator, passed 
over a pulley wheel and kept taut by a weight hanging from its end. The 
frequency of the oscillator is adjusted until nodes and antinodes are clearly 
visible. A strobe lamp can be used to ‘slow down’ the motion so that the 
standing wave can be studied in more detail. The wavelength of the wave is 
found by measuring the distance between alternate nodes.

Figure 16.13 Melde’s experiment. 
Standing waves of shorter or longer wavelength are observed if the frequency 
of the oscillator is increased or decreased or the weight on the string is altered. 
The speed of the incident and reflected waves in the string can be calculated 
using v = f λ. An investigation into how this depends on the tension or 
thickness of the string can be performed.
Stringed instruments
Stringed instruments such as guitars, violins and pianos all produce standing 
waves on strings stretched between two points. When plucked, bowed or 
struck, the energy in the standing wave is transferred to the air around it 
and generates a sound. Because the string interacts with only a small region 
of air, the sound needs to be amplified – either by a 
resonating sound box or electronically.
The principle of stringed instruments can be 
demonstrated using a sonometer  (Figure 16.14). 
When the string is plucked at its midpoint, the waves 
reflected from each end will interfere to set up a 
standing wave in the string. As both ends are fixed, 
they must be nodes, so the simplest standing wave 
will have one antinode between two nodes – that 
is, the length of the string will be half a wavelength.
Using the expression v = Tμ and the wave equation, 
v = f λ, the frequency of the note emitted by the 
wire in this mode will be f = v

When a wave passes through a gap or is partially obstructed by a barrier, the 
wavefront spreads out into the ‘shadow’ region (Figure 16.20a). This effect is 
called diffraction  and is easily demonstrated using a ripple tank. The dark 
and light lines represent crests and troughs on the surface of the water, and 
can therefore be considered as wavefronts.
If the oscillator in a ripple tank is adjusted to a higher frequency, the 
wavelength shortens and the spreading is reduced. Narrowing the aperture 
of the gap between two barriers causes even more spreading of the wave 
(Figure 16.20b). When the width is similar to the wavelength, the wavefronts 
are almost circular.
Diffraction can be explained using Huygens’ construction (shown in 
Figure 16.21) Huygens considered every point on a wavefront as the source 
of secondary spherical wavelets which spread out with the wave velocity. 
The new wavefront is the envelope of these secondary wavelets.
When a wavefront is obstructed by a slit or an obstacle, the secondary 
wavelets at the edges are transmitted into the geometrical shadow causing 
the diffraction spreading. In some instances patterns can be seen due to the 
interference of imagined point sources on the wavefront as it passes through 
the slit or around the obstruction.
Figures 16.22 (a) and (c) show how the secondary wavelets at S1 and 
S2 spill over into the geometrical shadow. Figure 16.22 (b) illustrates how 
the wavefront in a very narrow aperture behaves as a single source of a 
secondary wavelet.

 16 Superposition of waves 262Short-wave radio and television signals do not diffract significantly into valleys 
or around the curvature of the Earth’s surface, but military communications 
radio sends out signals with wavelengths of several kilometres that can be 
detected by submarines almost halfway around the world.
Close inspection of the water waves on the ripple tank emerging from 
the narrow aperture in Figure 16.20b reveals regions of constructive and 
destructive superposition at the edges of the circular wavefront. This effect 
can be further investigated using a microwave kit (Figure 16.23). The 
transmitter is placed about 20  cm from a pair of aluminium sheets and 
directed at a gap of about 5  cm. The receiver is placed facing the aperture 
and about 50  cm away from the other side of the sheets. The output from the 
receiver is measured at the midpoint and at 10  ° intervals as it is moved along 
a semi-circular path.

Figure 16.23 Diffraction pattern.
The diffraction pattern shows a central maximum edged by a series of 
lower intensity maxima and minima as opposed to the regular pattern of 
interference from a double slit. The central maximum will broaden when 
the slit width is reduced.
It can be shown that, for a slit of width, a, the angle θ between the central 
maximum and the first minimum is given by the equation:
sin θ = λ
a
In general, to create a diffraction pattern using a slit, the wavelength 
should be of the same order of magnitude as the width of the slit. Patterns 
can be seen for slightly wider slits but the value of θ becomes smaller. For 
angles of less than about 10  °, the approximation sin  θ = tan  θ = θ radians 
can be used.
