As well as being found in all vertebrates, haemoglobin is found in earthworms, starfish, some insects, some plants and even in some bacteria.Haemoglobin Saturation Depends on the Partial Pressure of Oxygen1) The partial pressure of oxygen (p02) is a measure of oxygen concentration.The greater the concentration of dissolved oxygen in cells, the higher the partial pressure.2) Similarly, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pC02) is a measure of the concentration of CO, in a cell.3) Haemoglobin's affinity for oxygen varies depending on the partial pressure of oxygen:Oxygen loads onto haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin where there's a hi;Oxyhaemoglobin unloads its oxygen where there's a lower p02.4) Oxygen enters blood capillaries at the alveoli in the lungs. Alveoli have a high p02 so oxygen loads onto haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin.5) When cells respire, they use up oxygen \u2014 this lowers the pOr Red blood cells deliver oxyhaemoglobin to respiring tissues, where it unloads its oxygen6) The haemoglobin then returns to the lungs to pick up more oxygen.There was no use pretending \u2014 the partial pressure of CH., had just increased, and Keith knew who was to blame.Dissociation Curves Show How Affinity for Oxygen VariesA dissociation curve shows how saturated the haemoglobin is with oxygen at any given partial pressure.slll I I M M I III W I I I I I I II I \/\/,- 100% saturation means C- every haemoglobin molecule f~ is carrying the maximum -- of 4 molecules of oxygen. \u2014'\/1 I II I I M I II II M J 1 I II I I I IX\\U I I I II H I I I M I II M I I I M I l\/y- 0% saturation means none 3r of the haemoglobin molecules 5are carrying any oxygen. -\"'n I I M I i w I I I I II II 11 n I I 11The graph is 'S-shaped' because when haemoglobin (Hb) combines with the first 02 molecule, its shape alters in a way that makes it easier for other molecules to join too. But as the Hb starts to become saturated, it gets harder for more oxygen molecules to join. As a result, the curve has a steep bit in the middle where it's really easy for oxygen molecules to join, and shallow bits at each end where it's harder. When the curve is steep, a small change in p02 causes a big change in the amount of oxygen carried by the Hb.D.'Sg.o.g^i.p.D..Cv.rve,fpr..A<jM.ltHuman Haemoglobin\n\u201cI----1------1----r2 4 6 8 10partial pressure of 02 \/ kPaWhere p02 is high (e.g. in the lungs), haemoglobin has a high affinity for oxygen (i.e. it will readily combine with oxygen), so it has a high saturation of oxygen.Where p02 is low (e.g. in respiring tissues), haemoglobin has a low affinity for oxygen, which means it releases oxygen rather than combines with it. That's why it has a low saturation of oxygen.\nTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n","1":"96Classification of OrganismsFor hundreds of years people have been putting organisms into groups to make it easier to recognise and name them. For example, my brother is a member of the species Idioto bigearian (Latin for idiots with big ears).Phylogeny Tells Us About the Evolutionary History of Organisms1)2)3)First branch point- Orangutan- Human-Chimpanzee -Bonobo4)5)Phylogeny is the study of the evolutionary history of groups of organisms.Phylogeny tells us who's related to whom and how closely related they are.All organisms have evolved from shared common ancestors (relatives).This can be shown on a \u2014^phylogenetic tree, like this one. l \u2014\u2014\u20147\/This tree shows the relationship between members of the Hominidae family (great apes and humans).The first branch point represents a common ancestor of all the family members.This ancestor is now extinct. Orangutans were the first group to diverge (evolve to become a different species) from this common ancestor.Each of the following branch points represents another common ancestor from which a different group diverged. Gorillas diverged next, then humans, closely followed by bonobos and chimpanzees.Closely related species diverged away from each other most recently. E.g. humans and chimpanzees are closely related, as they diverged very recently. You can see this because their branches are close together.\u0000 Gorilla\nClassification is All About Grouping Together Related OrganismsTaxonomy is the science of classification. It involves naming organisms and organising them into groups.This makes it easier to identify and study them. Scientists now take into account phylogeny when classifying organisms, and group organisms according to their evolutionary relationships.1) There are eight levels of groups used to classify organisms.These groups are called taxa. Each group is called a taxon.2) The groups are arranged in a hierarchy, with the largest groups at the top and the smallest groups at the bottom.Organisms can only belong to one group at each level in the hierarchy \u2014 there's no overlap.3) Organisms are first sorted into three large groups (or taxa) called domains \u2014 the Eukarya, Bacteria and Archaea.4) Related organisms in a domain are then sorted into slightly smaller groups called kingdoms, e.g. all animalsare in the animal kingdom. More closely related organisms from that kingdom are then groupedinto a phylum, then grouped into a class, and so on down the eight levels of the hierarchy.DomainKingdomPhylumClassOrderFamilyGenusSpecies- You need to learn -\"ames andorder of the groups -5)6)As you move down the hierarchy, there are more groups at each level but fewer organisms in each group. The organisms in each group also become more closely related.The hierarchy ends with species \u2014 the groups that contain only one type of organism (e.g. humans, dogs, E. coll). You need to learn the definition of a species:A species is a group of similar organisms able to reproduce to give fertile offspring.7) Scientists constantly update classification systems because of discoveries about new species and new evidence about known organisms (e.g. DNA sequence data \u2014 see page 98).Topic 4B \u2014 Diversity, Classification and Variation\n","2":"146Topic 6C \u2014 HomeostasisHomeostasis BasicsAh, there's nothing like learning a nice long word to start you off on a new section \u2014 welcome to homeostasis.Homeostasis is the Maintenance of a Stable Internal Environment1) Changes in your external environment can affect your internal environment\u2014 the blood and tissue fluid that surrounds your cells.2) Homeostasis involves control systems that keep your internal environment roughly constant (within certain limits).3) Keeping your internal environment stable is vital for cells to function normally and to stop them being damaged.4) It's particularly important to maintain the right core body temperature and blood pH. This is because temperature and pH affect enzyme activity, and enzymes control the rate of metabolic reactions:\u2022 If body temperature is too high (e.g. 40 \u00b0C) enzymes may becomc denatured. The enzyme's molecules vibrate too much, which breaks the hydrogen bonds that hold them in their 3D shape.The shape of the enzyme's active site is changed and it no longer works as a catalyst.This means metabolic reactions are less efficient.\u2022 If body temperature is too low enzyme activity is reduced, slowing the rate of metabolic reactions.\u2022 The highest rate of enzyme activity happens at their optimum temperature (about 37 \u00b0C in humans).\u2022 If blood pH is too high or too low (highly alkaline or acidic) enzymes become denatured. The hydrogen bonds that hold them in their 3D shape are broken, so the shape of the enzyme's active site is changed and it no longer works as a catalyst. This means metabolic reactions are less efficient.\u2022 The highest rate of enzyme activity happens at their optimum pH \u2014 usually around pH 7 (neutral), but some enzymes work best at other pHs, e.g. enzymes found in the stomach work best at a low pH.5) It's important to maintain the right concentration of glucose in the blood because cells need glucose for energy. Blood glucose concentration also affects the water potential of blood \u2014 this is the potential (likelihood)of water molecules to diffuse out of or into a solution.\u2022 If blood glucose concentration is too high the water potential of blood is reduced to a point where water molecules diffuse out of cells into the blood by osmosis.This can cause the cells to shrivel up and die.\u2022 If blood glucose concentration is too low, cells are unable to carry out normal activities because there isn't enough glucose for respiration to provide energy.Homeostatic Systems Detect a Change and Respond by Negative Feedback1)2)3)4)5)6)Homeostatic systems involve receptors, a communication system and effectors (like the nervous system \u2014 see page 128).Receptors detect when a level is too high or too low, and the information's communicated via the nervous system or the hormonal system to effectors.The effectors respond to counteract the change \u2014 bringing the level back to normal. The mechanism that restores the level to normal is called a negative feedback mechanism.Negative feedback keeps things around the normal level, e.g. body temperature is usually kept within 0.5 \u00b0C above or below 37 \u00b0C.Negative feedback only works within certain limits though \u2014 if the change is too big then the effectors may not be able to counteract it, e.g. a huge drop in body temperature caused by prolonged exposure to cold weather may be too large to counteract.Control of body temperature by negative feedback:body detects temperature's too hotyour internal environment stays around the normal level (37 \u00b0C)body detects temperature's too coldeffectors respond to increase the temperaturetimea>ouJ3u\nTopic 6C \u2014 Homeostasis\n","3":"MAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS 34 1B.2 THE ROLES OF THE BLOOD\nopposite directions.

As it \ncools further, the molecules become more widely spaced. As a result, ice is less dense than water and floats, forming an insulating layer and helping to prevent the water underneath it from freezing. It also melts quickly because, being at the top, it is exposed to the sun. It is very unusual for the solid form of  a substance to be less dense than the liquid form. This unusual property enables organisms to live in water, even in countries where it gets cold enough to freeze in winter.\n \u2022W\nater is slow to absorb and release heat \u2013 it has a high specific \nheat capacity. The hydrogen bonds between the molecules need a lot of  energy to separate them. This means the temperature of  large bodies of  water such as lakes and seas does not change much throughout the year. This makes them good habitats for living organisms.\n \u2022W\nater is a liquid \u2013 it cannot be compressed. This is an \nimportant factor in many hydraulic mechanisms in living organisms.\n \u2022W\nater molecules are cohesive \u2013 the forces between the \nmolecules mean they stick together.

This is also important in plant transport systems and in surface tension.\n \u2022W\nater has a very high surface tension because the attraction \nbetween the water molecules, including hydrogen bonds, is greater than the attraction between the water molecules and the air. As a result, the water molecules hold together forming a thin \u2018skin\u2019 of  surface tension. Surface tension is very important in plant transport systems, and also affects life at the surface of  ponds, lakes and other water masses (see fig I).\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that co means two similar things together, as in cohabit, \nand ad means two different things together.\n\u25b2 fig I Without surface tension, a r aft spider like this could not move \nacross the water and hunt.EXAM HINT\nAll these properties are a result of dipoles and hydrogen bonding between water molecules.

The arteries and veins are like the large roads carrying heavy traffic while the narrow town streets and tracks are represented by the vast area of  branching and spreading capillaries called the capillary network. In the capillary network, substances carried by the blood are exchanged with cells in the same way that products are transported from factories, oil refineries or farms and distributed into shops and homes. The structures of  the different types of  blood vessel closely reflect their functions in your body.\nARTERIES\nArteries carry blood away from your heart towards the cells of  your body. The structure of  an artery is shown in fig A. Almost all arteries carry oxygenated blood. The exceptions are:\n \u2022the pulmonar\ny artery \u2013 carrying deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs\n \u2022the umbilical ar\ntery \u2013 during pregnancy, this carries deoxygenated blood from the fetus to  \nthe placenta.\nThe arteries leaving the heart branch off  in every direction, and the diameter of  the lumen, the central space inside the blood vessel, gets smaller the further away it is from the heart. The very smallest branches of  the arterial system, furthest from the heart, are the arterioles. \nThe middle layers of\nthe artery wall containelastic \ufb01bres and smoothmuscle; arteries nearestthe heart have more elastic\ufb01bres, those further fromthe heart have a greaterproportion of muscle tissue.\nelastic \ufb01bres andsmooth musclelumentough outerlayer\nendotheliumexternal layerof tough tissue\nThe endothelium forms asmooth lining which allows theeasiest possible \ufb02ow of blood.Lumen is small whenartery unstretched by\ufb02ow of blood from heart.\n\u25b2 fig A  T he structure of an artery means it is adapted to cope with the surging of the blood as the heart pumps.\nBlood is pumped out from the heart in a regular rhythm, about 70 times a minute. Each heartbeat \nsends a high-pressure flow of  blood into the arteries. The major arteries close to the heart must withstand these pressure surges. Their walls contain a lot of  elastic fibres, so they can stretch to accommodate the greater volume of  blood without being damaged (see fig B). Between surges, the elastic fibres return to their original length, squeezing the blood to move it along in a continuous flow. The pulse you can feel in an artery is the effect of  the surge each time the heart beats. The blood pressure in all arteries is relatively high, but it falls in arteries further away from the heart. These are known as the peripheral arteries. LEARNING TIP\nRemember that all arteries carry \nblood away from the heart, so they have thick walls and lots of collagen to withstand the high pressure.\nEXAM HINT\nYou will study the structure and the function of the types of blood vessel separately. However, you should remember that the vessels do not exist separately \u2013 they are all interlinked within the whole circulatory system.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

As the bacteria reproduced, they took up nitrogen from the broth to help make nucleotides for new DNA. So the nitrogen gradually became part of the bacteria's DNA.2) A sample of DNA was taken from each batch of bacteria, and spun in a centrifuge. The DNA from the heavy nitrogen bacteria settled lower down the centrifuge tube than the DNA from the light nitrogen bacteria \u2014 because it's heavier.3) Then the bacteria grown in the heavy nitrogen broth were taken out and put in a broth containing only light nitrogen. The bacteria were left for one round of DNA replication, and then another DNA sample was taken out and spun in the centrifuge.4) If replication was conservative, the original heavy DNA, which would still be together, would settle at the bottom and the new light DNA would settle at the top.5) If replication was semi-conservative, the new bacterial DNA molecules would contain one strand of the old DNA containing heavy nitrogen and one strand of new DNA containing light nitrogen. So the DNA would settle out between where the light nitrogen DNA settled out and where the heavy nitrogen DNA settled out.6) As it turned out, the DNA settled out in the middle, showing that the DNA molecules contained a mixture of heavy and light nitrogen. The bacterial DNA had replicated semi-conservatively in the light nitrogen.Once Meselson and Stahl had confirmed that DNA replication in bacteria was semi-conservative, other scientists carried out experiments to show that it was the universal method for DNA replication in all living things.Practice QuestionsQ1 What is the role of DNA helicase in DNA replication?Q2 What's the key difference between the conservative and semi-conservative theories of DNA replication?Exam QuestionQ1 Dcscribc the process of semi-conservative DNA replication.

Here are a few examples for you.You can Investigate Factors Affecting Respiration in Single-celled OrganismsYeast are single-celled organisms that can be grown in culture. They can respire aerobically when plenty of oxygen is available and anaerobically when oxygen isn't available. Both aerobic and anaerobic respiration in yeast produce C02, so the rate of C02 production gives an indication of the yeast's respiration rate. One way to measure CO, production is by using a gas syringe to collect the CO.,.The methods below show you how to investigate the effects of temperature on yeast respiration.

Place the test tube in a water bath set to one of thetemperatures being investigated.

The gas syringe should be set to zero.Start a stop watch as soon as the bung has been put in the test tube.As the yeast respire, the C02 formed will travel up the tube and into the gas syringe, which is used to measure the volume of C02 released.At regular time intervals (e.g. every minute), record the volume of C02 that is present in the gas syringe.Do this for a set amount of time (e.g. 10 minutes).A control experiment should also be set up at each temperature, where no yeast is present. No C02 should be formed without the yeast. Repeat the experiment three times at each temperature you're investigating.

In \nmammals, the heart is a complex, four-chambered muscular organ that sits in the chest protected by the ribs and sternum.

The right side of  the heart receives blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs. The left side of  the heart receives blood from the lungs and pumps it to the body. The blood in each side of  the heart does not mix with the blood from the other side. The two sides are separated by a thick, muscular septum. The heart is made of  a unique type of  muscle, known as cardiac muscle, which has special properties \u2013 it can carry on contracting regularly without resting or getting fatigued. Y ou will study this in more detail in Book 2 Topic 7. Cardiac muscle has a good blood supply \u2013 the coronary arteries bring oxygenated blood to the tissue (see fig B).

This contains synaptic vesicles filled with chemicals called neurotransmitters.4) When an action potential reaches the end of a neurone it causes neurotransmitters to be released into the synaptic cleft.They diffuse across to the postsynaptic membrane (the one after the synapse) and bind to specific receptors.5) When neurotransmitters bind to receptors they might trigger an action potential (in a neurone), cause muscle contraction(in a muscle cell), or cause a hormone to be secreted (from a gland cell).6) Because the receptors are only on the postsynaptic membranes, synapses make sure impulses are unidirectional \u2014 the impulse can only travel in one direction.7) Neurotransmitters are removed from the cleft so the response doesn't keep happening, e.g. they're taken backinto the presynaptic neurone or they're broken down by enzymes (and the products are taken into the neurone).8) There are many different neurotransmitters, e.g. acetylcholine (ACh) and noradrenaline.

An action potential on the postsynaptic membrane is generated if the threshold is reached.9) ACh is removed from the synaptic cleft so the response doesn't keep happening.

The potential difference becomes more negative than the resting potential (i.e. less than -70 mV).^ Resting potential \u2014 the ion channels are reset. The sodium-potassium pump returns the membrane to its resting potential and maintains it until the membrane's excited by another stimulus.After an action potential, the neurone cell membrane can't be excited again straight away. This is because the ion channels are recovering and they can't be made to open \u2014 sodium ion channels are closed during repolarisation and potassium ion channels are closed during hyperpolarisation. This period of recovery is called the refractory period.The Action Potential Moves Along the Neurone as a Wave of Depolarisation1) When an action potential happens, some of the sodium ions that enter the neurone diffuse sideways.2) This causes sodium ion channels in the next region of the neurone to open and sodium ions diffuse into that part.3) This causes a wave of depolarisation to travel along the neurone.4) The wave moves away from the parts of the membrane in the refractory period because these parts can't fire anaction potential.refractory refractoryperiodi It's like a Mexican wave _ = travelling through a - = crowd \u2014 sodium ions _ ' rushing inwards causes __ = a wave of activity alongstimulus -+ + +----------------Nt Nlthe membrane. rwave of depolarisationThe Refractory Period Produces Discrete Impulses1) During the refractory period, ion channels are recovering and can't be opened.2) So the refractory period acts as a time delay between one action potential and the next.This means that:\u2022 action potentials don't overlap, but pass along as discrete (separate) impulses.\u2022 there's a limit to the frequency at which the nerve impulses can be transmitted.\u2022 action potentials are unidirectional (they only travel in one direction).Action Potentials have an AII-or-Nothing Nature1) Once the threshold is reached, an action potentialwill always fire with the same change in voltage, cmaiutimnlnc AAAno matter how big the stimulus is. a2) If the threshold isn't reached, an action potential won't fire.

Increasingly, there is general agreement \nthat fi rms must adopt a wider perspective when setting \ntheir objectives and not just be aiming for pro fi ts or \nexpansion. One reason for this is the much greater adverse \npublicity given to business activity that is perceived as \nbeing damaging to stakeholder groups and the wider \nworld. Increasingly, in fl uential pressure groups are forcing \nbusinesses to reconsider their approach to decision-\nmaking. Also, legal changes \u00a0\u2013 at the local, national and \nEU level \u00a0\u2013 have forced businesses to refrain from certain \npractices.

Might businesses be criticised \nfor \u2018jumping on the corporate social responsibility \nbandwagon\u2019 rather than praised for their genuine concern \nfor society and the environment? Conceivably, fi rms are \nbeing ethical or environmentally conscious because they \nhave an objective that Peter Drucker, a famous writer \non management, calls \u2018public responsibility\u2019, because \nthey want to behave in these ways. Many consumer \ngroups and pressure groups are still dubious as to \nwhether these objectives are based on genuinely held \nbeliefs or not.

They're much easier to explain if you describe their structure in four 'levels'. These levels are a protein's primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures.Primary Structure \u2014 this is the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain.Secondary Structure \u2014 the polypeptide chain doesn't remain flat and straight.Hydrogen bonds form between the amino acids in the chain.This makes it automatically coil into an alpha (a) helix or fold into a beta ((3) pleated sheet \u2014 this is the secondary structure.Tertiary Structure \u2014 the coiled or folded chain of amino acids is often coiled and folded further. More bonds form between different parts of the polypeptide chain, including hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds (attractions between negative and positive charges on different parts of the molecule).Disulfide bridges also form whenever two molecules of the amino acid cysteine come close together \u2014 the sulfur atom in one cysteine bonds to the sulfur atom in the other. For proteins made from a single polypeptide chain, the tertiary structure forms their final 3D structure.Quaternary Structure \u2014 some proteins are made of several different polypeptide chains held together by bonds. The quaternary structureis the way these polypeptide chains are assembled together. For proteins made from more than one polypeptide chain (e.g. haemoglobin, insulin, collagen), the quaternary structure is the protein's final 3D structure.amino acid\nTopic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","17":"MAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS 38 1B.3 CIRCULATION IN THE BLOOD VESSELS\nEXAM HINT\nThe role of the elastic fibres in artery walls is to return to their original \nlength to help maintain the pressure.

The elastic recoil does not help to increase pressure, it simply helps to maintain the pressure \u2013 so do not suggest that the recoil helps pump blood along.\nIn the peripheral arteries, the muscle fibres in the vessel walls \ncontract or relax to change the size of  the lumen, controlling the blood flow. The smaller the lumen, the harder it is for blood to flow through the vessel. This controls the amount of  blood that flows into an organ, so regulating its activity.

Remember to link this to things you may learn later such as how blood flow to the skin changes when you are too hot or too cold.\nCAPILLARIES\nArterioles lead into networks of  capillaries. These are very small \nvessels that spread throughout the tissues of  the body. The capillary network links the arterioles and the venules. Capillaries branch between cells \u2013 no cell is far from a capillary, so substances can diffuse between cells and the blood quickly. Also, because the diameter of  each individual capillary is small, the blood travels relatively slowly through them, giving more opportunity for diffusion to occur (see fig C). The smallest capillary is no wider than a single red blood cell.\nCapillaries have a very simple structure which is well adapted \nto their function. Their walls are very thin and contain no elastic fibres, smooth muscle or collagen. This helps them fit between individual cells and allows rapid diffusion of  substances between the blood and the cells. The walls consist of  just one very thin cell. Oxygen and other molecules, such as digested food molecules and hormones, quickly diffuse out of  the blood in the capillaries into the nearby body cells, and carbon dioxide and other waste molecules diffuse into the capillaries. Blood entering the capillary network from the arteries is oxygenated.

High light intensity of a certain wavelengthLight is needed to provide the energy for the light-dependent reaction\u2014 the higher the intensity of the light, the more energy it provides.Only certain wavelengths of light are used for photosynthesis.The photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotene only absorb the red and blue light in sunlight.(Green light is reflected, which is why plants look green.)2. Temperature around 25 \u00b0CWavelength \/ nmPhotosynthesis involves enzymes (e.g. ATP synthase, rubisco). If the temperature falls below 10 \u00b0C the enzymes become inactive, but if the temperature is more than 45 \u00b0C they may start to denature.Also, at high temperatures stomata close to avoid losing too much water. This causes photosynthesis to slow down because less C02 enters the leaf when the stomata are closed.3. Carbon dioxide at 0.4%\u2022 Carbon dioxide makes up 0.04% of the gases in the atmosphere.\u2022 Increasing this to 0.4% gives a higher rate of photosynthesis, but any higher and the stomata start to close.Plants also need a constant supply of water \u2014 too little and photosynthesis has to stop but too much and the soil becomes waterlogged (reducing the uptake of minerals such as magnesium, which is needed to make chlorophyll a).Light, Temperature and C02  can all Limit Photosynthesis1) All three of these things need to be at the right level to allow a plant to photosynthesise as quickly as possible.2) If any one of these factors is too low or too high, it will limit photosynthesis (slow it down).Even if the other two factors are at the perfect level, it won't make any difference to the speed of photosynthesis as long as that factor is at the wrong level.3) On a warm, sunny, windless day, it's usually C02 that's the limiting factor, and at night it's the light intensity.4) However, any of these factors could become the limiting factor, depending on the environmental conditions.i\/iCD-PCo-poAlight intensityBetween points A and B, the rate of photosynthesis is limited by the light intensity.

They are an \nintegral part of  all cell membranes and are also used as an energy store. Lipids contain many carbon\u2013\nhydrogen bonds and almost no oxygen. When lipids are oxidised in the respiration process, the bonds are broken and carbon dioxide and water are the final products. This reaction can be used to drive the production of  much ATP (see Sections 1A.3, 2A.2 and 2A.4 and Book 2 Chapter 5A). Lipids, \nespecially triglycerides, store about three times as much energy as the same mass of  carbohydrates. Many plants and animals convert spare food into oils or fats as an energy store to use when needed. For example, the seeds of  plants contain lipids to provide energy for the seedling when it starts to grow, which is why seeds are such an important food source for many animals.\nFATS AND OILS\nFats and oils are important groups of  lipids. Chemically they are very similar, but fats such as butter are solids at room temperature whereas oils such as olive oil are liquids (see fig A). Fats come mainly from animal sources while oils are mainly from plant sources.\nLike carbohydrates, the chemical elements that all lipid molecules contain are carbon, hydrogen and \noxygen. However, lipids contain a much lower proportion of  oxygen than carbohydrates. Fats and oils contain two types of  organic chemical substance, fatty acids and glycerol (propane-1,2,3-triol). These are combined using ester bonds. Glycerol has the chemical formula C\n3H8O3 (see fig B).\nAll fatty acids have a long hydrocarbon chain \u2013 a folded backbone of  carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms attached, and a carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) at one end. Living tissues contain more than 70 different types of  fatty acid. Fatty acids vary in two ways:\n \u2022the length of\n the carbon chain can differ (but is often 15\u201317 carbon atoms long)\n \u2022the f\natty acid may be a saturated fatty acid or an unsaturated fatty acid.\nIn a saturated fatty acid, each carbon atom is joined to the one next to it by a single covalent bond. A common example is stearic acid (see fig C). In an unsaturated fatty acid, the carbon chains have one or more double covalent bonds between carbon atoms in them. A monounsaturated fatty acid has one carbon\u2013carbon double bond and a polyunsaturated fatty acid has more than one carbon\u2013carbon double bond (see fig\u00a0D). Linoleic acid is an example of  a polyunsaturated fatty acid.

Why do they do this? \nPREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE \nCardiovascular disease has a negative effect on individuals, on families  and on society. It costs a lot of  money to treat people in hospital. When  people are too ill to work, they are losing money for their families, and  also for the companies where they work. Treating people with drugs to  prevent them from needing surgery is cheaper for health service providers.  It is even cheaper (and better for the individual) if  we can stop ourselves  needing the drugs. So, prevention is better than treatment for CVDs for  many reasons (see fig A). However, persuading people to change their  \nlifestyle habits is often difficult.\nFor example, there is a lot of  reliable evidence to show that smoking is  \none of  the highest risk factors for CVDs. However, if  you stop smoking,  your risk of  developing heart disease is almost halved after just one year.  Moreover, research carried out by a team led by Azra Mahmud from  Trinity College Dublin and published in 2007 suggests that after 10 years,  the arteries of  smokers who stop smoking are the same as if  they had  never smoked. There is a lot of  support available for people who want to  stop smoking. Y et, despite all this, almost 1 billion people around the  world smoke cigarettes and millions of  them die each year of  CVDs and  cancers linked to their smoking. \nHealth education programmes in schools and communities can help to  \nmake sure that everyone is aware of  the risks associated with different  lifestyle choices. However, each individual has to make their own choices  and take their own risks.\nOVERWEIGHT OR UNDERFIT?\nMost people are aware that obesity is linked to CVDs, and many go on  slimming diets to try to lose weight. Most people also know that taking  regular exercise helps protect against CVDs \u2013 but more people choose to  go on a diet than choose to take regular exercise. The results of  a study  carried out over an average of  eight years on 20\n 000 men a\nged from  \n30 to 83 years are given in Section 1C.4 fig\u00a0B. Fitness was defined by  how much oxygen they used during exercise. The results show that if  you  are obese and fit you have a lower risk of  dying from CVDs than someone  who is not obese but unfit. Obviously, being the correct weight and fit is  best of  all! \nThe problem is that many people enjoy their food, and don\u2019t take sufficient exercise. It takes a lot of  \neffort to cut down the amount of  food you eat and change to eating healthier foods including lots of  fruit and vegetables. \u25b2\n fig A  Infogr aphics like this one published in Gulf News help \npeople understand the factors which affect their heart health.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember to read all the \ninformation in graphics.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

These cells require a supply of  chemical substances such as glucose and oxygen for cellular respiration. These must be transported from outside a large organism into the cells. Respiration supplies energy for the other reactions of  life, but it also produces the toxic waste product carbon dioxide. This and other waste products need to be removed from the cells before they cause damage to them. \nLarge multicellular organisms have internal transport systems that \ncarry substances to every cell in the body. These systems deliver oxygen and nutrients and remove waste so that cells can carry out their functions efficiently. In large complex animals such as humans, chemicals made in a cell in one part of  the body \u2013 such as a hormone like insulin or adrenaline \u2013 may influence a different type of  cell elsewhere in the body. So substances made internally need to be moved around the body as well.\nIn many animals, including all the vertebrates, this transport \nsystem is the heart and circulatory system and the fluid that flows through it. This is an example of  a mass transport system \u2013 substances are transported in the flow of  a fluid with a mechanism for moving it around the body. All large complex organisms have some form of  mass transport system which overcomes the limits of  diffusion between the internal and external environments. Substances are delivered over short distances from the mass transport system to individual cells deep in the body by processes such as diffusion, osmosis and active transport.\nFEATURES OF MASS TRANSPORT SYSTEMS\nMass transport systems are very effective for moving substances around the body. Most mass transport systems have certain features which are the same. They have:\n \u2022e\nxchange surfaces to get materials into and out of  the transport \nsystem\n \u2022a system of\n vessels that carry substances \u2013 these are usually \ntubes, sometimes following a very specific route, sometimes widespread and branching\n \u2022a w\nay of  making sure that substances are moved in the right \ndirection (e.g. nutrients in and waste out)\n \u2022a w\nay of  moving materials fast enough to supply the needs \nof  the organism \u2013 this may involve mechanical methods such as the pumping of  the heart or ways of  maintaining a concentration gradient so that substances move quickly from one place to another (e.g. using active transport)\n \u2022a suita\nble transport medium (e.g. fluid)\n \u2022in man\ny cases, a way of  adapting the rate of  transport to the \nneeds of  the organism.\nCIRCULATION SYSTEMS\nMany animals have a circulatory system in which a heart pumps blood around the body. Insects have an open circulatory system with the blood circulating in large open spaces. However, most larger animals, including mammals, have a closed circulatory system with the blood contained within tubes. The blood makes a continuous journey out to the most distant parts of  the body and back to the heart.\nLEARNING TIP\nThe main advantages of a closed system are:\n\u2022 the pressure can be increased to make the blood flow more quickly\n\u2022 the flow can be directed more precisely to the organs that need \nmost oxygen and nutrients.\nAnimals such as fish have a single circulation system (see fig \nC). The heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the gills, the organs \nof  gas exchange where the blood takes in oxygen (becomes oxygenated) and gives up carbon dioxide at the same time. The blood then travels on around the rest of  the body of  the fish, giving up oxygen to the body cells before returning to the\u00a0heart.\ngill\ncapillarie saorta\nventricle atriumsystemic\ncapillarie s\n\u25b2 fig C  T he single circulation of a fish  \nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that mass flow is like a stream with all the components \nflowing together.\nBirds and mammals need much more oxygen than fish. Not \nonly do they have to move around without the support of  water, but they also maintain a constant body temperature that may be higher or lower than their surroundings. This takes a lot of  resources, so their cells need plenty of  oxygen and glucose and make waste products that need to be removed quickly. Birds and mammals have evolved the most complex type of  transport system, known as a double circulation because it involves two separate circulation systems. The systemic circulation carries oxygenated blood (oxygen-rich blood) from the heart to the cells of  the body where the oxygen is used. It also carries the deoxygenated blood (blood that has given up its oxygen to the body cells) back to the heart. The pulmonary circulation carries\u00a0deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs to be oxygenated and then carries the oxygenated blood back to the heart (see fig D).\nThe separate circuits of  a double circulatory system ensure that \nthe oxygenated and deoxygenated blood cannot mix, so the tissues receive as much oxygen as possible. Another big advantage is that the fully oxygenated blood can be delivered quickly to the body tissues at high pressure. The blood going through the tiny blood vessels in the lungs is at relatively low pressure, so it does \nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

There are loads of different stains, all with crazy names (toluidine blue O, ethano-orcein, Feulgen stain...If you're using the beulgen stain, you'll need an extra rinse.Place a cover slip over the cells and push down firmly to squash the tissue. This will make the tissue thinner and allow light to pass through it. Don't smear the cover slip sideways (or you'll damage the chromosomes).Now you can look at all the stages of mitosis under an optical microscope (see below).

You'll also need to label your drawing.High and low power objective lensesThe Mitotic Index Is the Proportion of Cells Undergoing MitosisYou can calculate the mitotic index of your cells using this formula:mitotic index =number of cells with visible chromosomes total number of cells observedThis lets you work out how quickly the tissue is growing and if there's anything weird going on. A plant root tip is constantly growing, so you'd expect a high mitotic index (i.e. lots of cells in mitosis). In other tissue samples, a high mitotic index could mean that tissue repair is taking place or that there is cancerous growth in the tissue.Topic 2 A \u2014 Cell Structure and Division\n","28":"1CSPECIFICATION \nREFERENCE1  RISK,  CORRELATION AND CAUSE1.17 1.15\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n\u25fc Under stand why people\u2019s perception of risks is often different from the actual risks, including underestimating and \noverestimating the risks due to diet and other lifestyle factors in the development of heart disease.\n\u25fc\n Be a\nble to distinguish between correlation and causation.\nEvery country has diseases which affect its people and may even kill them. Some of  these diseases \naffect you randomly \u2013 there is nothing you can do to change whether you are affected or not. However, for many diseases, especially non-communicable (non-infectious) conditions such as heart disease \nand cancer, you can increase or lower your risk of  becoming ill, based on factors in your lifestyle. If  you understand the risk factors, you can help to make yourself  and your family healthier.\nWHAT IS RISK?\nThe word risk is used regularly in everyday conversation, but in science it has a very specific meaning. In science, risk describes the probability that an event will happen. Probability means the chance or likelihood of  the event, calculated mathematically. For example, imagine you have six coloured balls \u2013 red, blue, green, yellow, orange and purple \u2013 in a black cloth bag (see fig A). If  you reach in and pull out a single ball, the probability (risk) of  getting, say, a green ball can be expressed in one of  three ways:\n \u20221 in 6\n \u20220.166\n 66 r\necurring (0.17)\n \u202217%.\nT\nhis is the case for any one of  the six colours in the bag. In the same way, it is possible to work out \nyour risk of  developing certain specified diseases or of  dying from a specified cause. \nHOW DO WE PERCEIVE RISK? \nThe actual risk of  doing something is not always the same as the sense of  risk one feels. Most people don\u2019t think twice before getting into their car \u2013 but globally you have an annual risk of  1 in 5747 of  being killed in a road traffic accident. On the other hand, many people get very worried before flying, but commercial flights have a 1 in 4.5\u20135.5\u00a0million risk of  crashing. Personal perception of  risk is based on a variety of  factors which include: \n \u2022ho\nw familiar you are with the activity \n \u2022ho\nw much you enjoy the activity\n \u2022w\nhether or not you approve of  the activity. \nThe actual mathematical risk may play very little part in developing your personal perception of  risk. People often overestimate the benefits, or minimise the risk, of  behaviour that they want to continue. For example, there is now strong evidence from around the world that obesity is linked to a range of  diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers. However, people like eating and so they still become overweight. On the other hand, they will over-emphasise the risks of  activities if  they want to avoid them or prevent others from doing them. For example, parents over-emphasise the risk of  wandering away to small children, to help make the child behave and stay close.\nIn another example, there is good scientific evidence that smoking affects our risk of  developing \ndiseases such as atherosclerosis, as well as lung cancer. However, knowledge of  the mathematical risk of  an early death if  you smoke cigarettes doesn\u2019t always stop people from smoking.\u25b2 fig A  T he risk, chance or \nprobability that you will pick a blue ball out of the black bag is 1 in 6. If\u00a0you return the ball to the bag each time, you will have exactly the same probability of picking a blue ball again the next time. The probability will always be 1\u00a0in 6.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

This means that there's a voltage across the membrane. Voltage is also known as potential difference.\u2022 The potential difference when a cell is at rest is called its resting potential. When a stimulus is detected, the cell membrane is excited and becomes more permeable, allowing more ions to move in and out of the cell \u2014 altering the potential difference. The change in potential difference due to a stimulus is called the generator potential.\u2022 A bigger stimulus excites the membrane more, causing a bigger movement of ions and a bigger change in potential difference \u2014 so a bigger generator potential is produced.\u2022 If the generator potential is big enough it'll trigger an action potential \u2014 an electrical impulse along aneurone (see pages 136-137). An action potential is only triggered if the generator potential reaches a certain level called the threshold level. Action potentials are all one size, so the strength of the stimulus is measured by the frequency of action potentials (the number of action potentials triggered during a certain time period).\u2022 If the stimulus is too weak the generator potential won't reach the threshold, so there's no action potential.Pacinian Corpuscles are Pressure Receptors in Your Skin1) Pacinian corpuscles are mechanoreceptors \u2014 they detect mechanical stimuli, e.g. pressure and vibrationsThey're found in your skin.2) Pacinian corpuscles contain the end of a sensory neurone, imaginatively called a sensory nerve ending. The sensory nerve ending is wrapped in loads of layers of connective tissue called lamellae.3) When a Pacinian corpuscle is stimulated, e.g. by a tap on the arm, the lamellae are deformed and press on the sensory nerve ending.A) This causes the sensory neurone's cell membrane to stretch, deforming the stretch-mediated sodium ion channels. The channels open and sodium ions diffuse into the cell, creating a generator potential.5) If the generator potential reaches the threshold, it triggers an action potential.Pacinian corpuscle\nNa\u2019 channels open, so Na* diffuses into cellall other parts of the membrane have Na' channels closedlayers of connective tissue (lamellae)_ sensory nerve ending\\sensory neuroneinside of the membrane is negatively charged\u2014 compared to the outsideO1'1 ' 1 I ' 1 I II 1 | I I III M M I I I I I I I | l | l , | I I M \/\/- racmian corpuscles only respond to mechanical 3Z stimuli this is a good example of how ~- receptors only respond to specific stimuli. =\" I ' 11 \" 1 11 1 1 1 1 ' l I I I I I I W M I I I M n | | | ,, ^Photoreceptors are Light Receptors in Your Eye1) Light enters the eye through the pupil.The amount of light that enters is controlled by the muscles of the iris.2) Light rays are focused by the lens onto the retina, which lines the inside of the eye.

These same bonds are essential in protein \nstructures. In amino acids, tiny negative charges are present on the oxygen of  the carboxyl groups and tiny positive charges are present on the hydrogen atoms of  the amino groups. When these charged groups are close to each other, the opposite charges attract, forming a hydrogen bond. Hydrogen bonds are weak but, potentially, they can be made between any two amino acids in the correct position, so there are many of  them holding the protein together very firmly. They are very important in the folding and coiling of  polypeptide chains (see fig C). Hydrogen bonds break easily and reform if  pH or temperature conditions change.\nDISULFIDE BONDS\nDisulfide bonds form when two cysteine molecules are close together in the structure of  a polypeptide (see fig C). An oxidation reaction occurs between the two sulfur-containing groups, resulting in a strong covalent bond known as a disulfide bond. These disulfide bonds are much stronger than hydrogen bonds but they happen much less often. They are important for holding the folded polypeptide chains in place.\nhydrogen bondhydrogen bond\ndisul\ufb01de bonddisul\ufb01de bond\n\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\n\u25b2 fig C  Hydr ogen bonds and disulfide bonds maintain the shape of protein molecules and this determines  \ntheir function.\nIONIC BONDS\nIonic bonds can form between some of  the strongly positive and negative amino acid side chains \nwhich are sometimes found deep inside the protein molecules. They are strong bonds, but they are not as common as the other structural bonds.\nY our hair is made of  the protein keratin. Some methods of  styling hair change the bonds within the protein \nmolecules. Blow drying or straightening hair breaks the hydrogen bonds and temporarily reforms them with the hair curling in a different way until the hydrogen bonds reform in their original places.\nPerming is a chemical treatment which is used in some hair salons to completely change the way hair \nlooks for weeks or months. The chemicals break the disulfide bonds between the polypeptide chains and reform them in a different place. This effect is permanent \u2013 hair will stay styled in that particular way until it is cut off.\nPROTEIN STRUCTURE\nProteins can be described by their primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure (see fig\u00a0D). \n \u2022T\nhe primary structure of  a protein is the sequence of  amino acids that make up the polypeptide \nchain, held together by peptide bonds.\n \u2022T\nhe secondary structure of  a protein is the arrangement of  the polypeptide chain into a regular, \nrepeating three-dimensional (3D) structure, held together by hydrogen bonds. One example is the right-handed helix (\u03b1-helix), a spiral coil with the peptide bonds forming the backbone and the R\u00a0groups protruding in all directions. Another is the \u00df-pleated sheet, in which the polypeptide chain folds into regular pleats held together by hydrogen bonds between the amino and carboxyl ends of  the amino acids. Most fibrous proteins have this type of  structure. Sometimes there is no regular secondary structure and the polypeptide forms a random coil.LEARNING TIP\nRemember that fibrous proteins \nhave a simpler structure and so tend to be more stable to changes in temperature and pH.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

And here's why...Totipotent Stem Cells are Able to Mature into Any Type of Body Cell1) Multicellular organisms are made up from many different cell types that are specialised for their function, e.g. liver cells, muscle cells, white blood cells.2) All these specialised cell types originally came from stem cells.3) Stem cells are unspecialised cells that can develop into other types of cell.4) Stem cells divide to become new cells, which then become specialised.5) All multicellular organisms have some form of stem cell.6) Stem cells are found in the embryo (where they become all the specialised cells needed to form a fetus) and in some adult tissues (where they become specialised cells that need to be replaced, e.g. stem cells in the intestines constantly replace intestinal epithelial cells).7) Stem cells that can mature (develop) into any type of body cell in an organism,(including the cells that make up the placenta in mammals) are called totipotent cells.8) Totipotent stem cells are only present in mammals in the first few cell divisions of an embryo.9) After this point the embryonic stem cells become pluripotent. They can still specialise into any cell in the body, but lose the ability to become the cells that make up the placenta.10) The stem cells present in adult mammals are either:\u2022 Multipotent stem cells \u2014 These are able to differentiate into a few different types of cell. For example, both red and white blood cells can be formed from multipotent stem cells found in bone marrow.\u2022 Unipotent stem cells \u2014 These can only differentiate into one type of cell.For example, there's a type of unipotent stem cell that can only divide to produce epidermal skin cells, which make up the outer layer of your skin.Stem Cells Become Specialised Because Different Genes are ExpressedStem cells become specialised because during their development, they only transcribe and translate part of their DNA:1)2)3)4)5)6)Stem cells all contain the same genes \u2014 but during development, not all of them are transcribed and translated (expressed).\"Mill III,, ,, m\u201e(\/- Remember: transcription is 3 Z when DNA is copied into ^- mRNA.

This enzyme can react with asubstrate to produce a coloured product. This causes the solution in the reaction vessel to change colour.4) If there's a colour change, it demonstrates that the antigen or antibody of interest is present in the sample being tested (e.g. blood plasma). In some types of ELISA, the quantity of this antigen\/antibody can be worked out from the intensity of the colour change.5) There are several different types of ELISA. Direct ELISA uses a single antibody that is complementary to the antigen you're testing for. Indirect ELISA is different because it uses two different antibodies.This method is outlined below:EXAMPLE: Using an ELISA as a HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) TestAn indirect ELISA test can be used to see if a patient possesses antibodies to the HIV virus:0 HIV antigen is bound to the bottom of a well in a well plate (a plastic tray with loads of little circular pits in it).\u00a9 A sample of the patient's blood plasma, which might contain several different antibodies, is added to the well.If there are any HIV-specific antibodies (i.e. antibodies against HIV) these will bind to the HIV antigen stuck to the bottom of the well. The well is then washed out to remove any unbound antibodies.(3) A secondary antibody, that has a specific enzyme attached to it, is added to the well.This secondary antibody can bind to the HIV-specific antibody (which is also called the primary antibody).The well is washed out again to remove any unbound secondary antibody. If there's no primary antibody in the sample, all of the secondary antibody will be washed away.(?) A solution is added to the well. This solution contains a substrate, which is able to react with the enzyme attached to the secondary antibody and produce a coloured product. If the solution changes colour, it indicates that the patient has HIV-specific antibodies in their blood and is infected with HIV.antibody specific to HIV antigenantibody not specific to HIV antigenHIVantigensecondary antibody with attached enzymecolour change = HIV is present (positive result)wash out 1= 0vXwash out(T) HIV antigen bound to bottom of the well(2) plasma sample added@ secondary antibody added(J) substrate addeds\\l I II II II II II I I I II I I I I i M II 11 \\ I I I I I I I I I I i H I I II M I II i II I I I I I I I i it I I\/, ~ The washing steps are important to make sure unbound antibodies aren't left in 3 5 the well which could affect the results.

One of  the main ways substances move into \nand out of  cells is by diffusion. Diffusion is the free movement of  particles in a liquid or a gas down a concentration gradient. This movement is from an area where the particles are at a relatively high concentration to an area where they are at a relatively low concentration (see Section 2A.2).\nIn single-celled organisms and microscopic multicellular organisms, diffusion is sufficient to supply all their needs. However, when organisms reach a certain size, diffusion alone is not enough.\nTRANSPORT IN SMALL ORGANISMS\nFor a single-celled organism like an amoeba and for very small multicellular organisms including many marine larvae, the nutrients and oxygen that they need can diffuse directly into the cells from the external environment and waste substances can diffuse directly out. This works well for the following reasons.\n \u2022T\nhe diffusion distances from the outside to the innermost areas of  \nthe cells are very small.\n \u2022T\nhe surface area in contact with the outside environment is very \nlarge when compared to the volume of  the inside of  the organism. Its surface area to volume ratio (sa\n :\n v\nol) is large, so there is \na relatively big surface area over which substances can diffuse into or out of  the organism (see figs A and B).\n \u2022T\nhe metabolic demands are low \u2013 the organisms do not regulate \ntheir own temperature and the cells do not use much oxygen and food or produce much carbon dioxide.\nSingle-celled organisms and very small multicellular organisms do not need specialised transport systems because diffusion is enough to supply their needs.\n\u25b2 fig A  T he surface area : volume ratio of this tiny jellyfish larva is relatively \nlarge so simple diffusion can supply all its needs.MODELLING SURFACE AREA\u00a0:\u00a0VOLUME RATIOS\nThe surface area\u00a0to\u00a0volume ratio of  an organism is the key factor \nthat determines whether diffusion alone will allow substances to move into and out of  all the cells rapidly enough. However, it is not easy to calculate the surface area\u00a0to\u00a0volume ratio of  organisms such as elephants, people and palm trees. It is difficult even for a single-celled Amoeba because of  its irregular shape.\nSo scientists use models to help show what happens in the real \nsituation (see fig B). A simple cube makes surface area\u00a0to\u00a0volume calculations easy. The bigger the organism gets, the smaller the surface area\u00a0to\u00a0volume ratio becomes. The distance from the outside of  the organism to the inside gets longer, and there is proportionately less surface for substances to enter through. So it takes longer for substances to diffuse in, and they may not reach the individual cells quickly enough to supply all their needs.\n1 mm cubeLarger surface area\ncompared to volume.\nSurface area 6 sides 3 12\n5 6  mm2\nVolume 13 5 1  mm3\nSurface areato volume rati\no6 : 16 sides 3 22\n5 24  mm2\n23 5 8  mm3\n3 : 16 sides 3 42\n5 96  mm2\n43 5 64  mm3\n3 : 2\nSurface area\n3.14  \u00b5m2\nVolume4\nr 3 4\n3pr 2p\n0.52  \u00b5m3\nSurface area\nto volume rati o6 : 112.57  \u00b5m2\n4.19  \u00b5m3\n3 : 150.27  \u00b5m2\n33.51  \u00b5m3\n3 : 22 mm cube 4 mm cubeSmaller surface area\ncompared to volume.\n0.5 \u00b5m radius 1 \u00b5m 2 \u00b5m\n\u25b2 fig B  In this diagr am, the cubes and spheres represent models  \nof organisms.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that small organisms have a small surface area.

Some habitats will be more biodiverse than others.2) Global biodiversity \u2014 you could also consider the variety of species on fcarlh. Recent estimates put the total number of species on tarth at about 8.7 million. Biodiversity varies in different parts of the world \u2014 it is greatest at the equator and decreases towards the poles.Pete wasn't sure that the company's new increased biodiversity policy would be good for productivity.Biodiversity Can be Measured Using an Index of Diversity1) Species richness is a measure of the number of different species in a community. It can be worked out by taking random samples of a community (see page 100) and counting the number of different species.2) Species richness is also a simple measure of biodiversity. But the number of different species in a communityisn't the only thing that affects biodiversity. The population sizes of those species do too. Species that are in acommunity in very small numbers shouldn't be treated the same as those with bigger populations.3) An index of diversity is another way of measuring biodiversity. It's calculated using an equation that takes both the number of species in a community (species richness) and the abundance of each species (population sizes) into account.4) You can calculate an index of diversity (d) using this formula:dN(N - 1) X n(n -  1)Where...N = Total number of organisms of all species n = Total number of organisms of one species X = 'Sum of' (i.e. added together)111 *11111 I I I I I I I \/ I I I I,Z.

However; your body has systems to control your heart beat which speed it up or slow it down.Cardiac Muscle Controls the Regular Beating of the HeartCardiac (heart) muscle is 'myogenic' \u2014 it can contract and relax without receiving signals from nerves.This pattern of contractions controls the regular heartbeat.1) The process starts in the sinoatrial node (SAN), which is in the wall of the right atrium.2) The SAN is like a pacemaker \u2014 it sets the rhythm of the heartbeat by sending out regular waves of electrical activity to the atrial walls.3) This causes the right and left atria to contract at the same time.4) A band of non-conducting collagen tissue prevents the waves of electrical activity from being passed directly from the atria to the ventricles.5) Instead, these waves of electrical activity are transferred from the SAN to the atrioventricular node (AVN).6) The AVN is responsible for passing the waves of electrical activity on to the bundle of His. But, there's a slight delay before the AVN reacts, to make sure the atria have emptied before the ventricles contract.7) The bundle of His is a group of muscle fibres responsible for conducting the waves of electrical activity between the ventricles to the apex (bottom) of the heart. The bundle splits into finer muscle fibres in the right and left ventricle walls, called the Purkyne tissue.8) The Purkyne tissue carries the waves of electrical activity into the muscular walls of the right and left ventricles, causing them to contract simultaneously, from the bottom up.waves of electrical\nPurkyne tissue\nControl of Heart Rate Involves the Brain and Autonomic Nervous System1) The sinoatrial node (SAN) generates electrical impulses that cause the cardiac muscles to contract.2) The rate at which the SAN fires (i.e. heart rate) is unconsciously controlled by a part of the braincalled the medulla oblongata.3) Animals need to alter their heart rate to respond to internal stimuli, e.g. to prevent fainting due to lowblood pressure or to make sure the heart rate is high enough to supply the body with enough oxygen.4) Stimuli are detected by pressure receptors and chemical receptors:\u2022 There are pressure receptors called baroreceptors in the aorta and the carotid arteries(major arteries in the neck).

It has loads of important functions, inside and outside of cells 1)Water is a metabolite in loads of important metabolic reactions, including condensation and hydrolysis reactions (see below).2) Water is a solvent, which means some substances dissolve in it.Most metabolic reactions take place in solution (e.g. in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells) so water's pretty essential.3) Water helps with temperature control because it has a high latent heat of vaporisation (see below) and a high specific heat capacity (see next page).4) Water molecules are very cohesive (they stick together), which helps water transport in plants (see next page) as well as transport in other organisms.r A metabolic reaction is a '' rr' react'\u00b0n that happens 5_ a living organism to keep the Z \u00b0Wnism alive.

Energy from ATP is released through a hydrolysis reaction (see page 22).Water has a High Latent Heat of Vaporisation1) It takes a lot of energy (heat) to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules.2) So water has a high latent heat of vaporisation \u2014 a lot of energy is used up when water evaporates (vaporises).3) This is useful for living organisms because it means they can use water loss through evaporation to cool down (e.g. humans sweat to cool down) without losing too much water.Topic 1B \u2014 More Biological Molecules\n","39":"10Enzyme ActionEnzymes crop up loads in biology \u2014 they're really useful 'cos they make reactions work quickly. So, whether you feel the need for some speed or not, read on \u2014 because you really need to know this basic stuff about enzymes.Enzymes are Biological CatalystsEnzymes speed up chemical reactions by acting as biological catalysts. A catalyst is a substance _1)2)3)4)5)6)- readior without being _r up in the reaction\"'t 11 n ' i\" 111\" 1Enzymes catalyse metabolic reactions \u2014 both at a cellular level (e.g. respiration) and for the organism as a whole (e.g. digestion in mammals).Enzymes can affect structures in an organism (e.g. enzymes are involved in the production of collagen, an important protein in the connective tissues of animals) as well as functions (like respiration).Enzyme action can be intracellular \u2014 within cells, or extracellular \u2014 outside cells.Enzymes are proteins (see previous page).Enzymes have an active site, which has a specific shape. The active site is the part of the enzyme where the substrate molecules (the substance that the enzyme interacts with) bind to.Enzymes are highly specific due to their tertiary structure (see next page).Enzymes Lower the Activation Energy of a ReactionIn a chemical reaction, a certain amount of energy needs to be supplied to the chemicals before the reaction will start. This is called the activation energy \u2014 it's often provided as heat. Enzymes lower the amount of activation energy that's needed, often making reactions happen at a lower temperature than they could without an enzyme. This speeds up the rate of reaction.When a substrate fits into the enzyme's active site it forms an enzyme-substrate complex \u2014 it's this that lowers the activation energy. Here are two reasons why:1) If two substrate molecules need to be joined, being attached to the enzyme holds them close together, reducing any repulsion between the molecules so they can bond more easily.2) If the enzyme is catalysing a breakdown reaction, fitting into the active site puts a strain on bonds in the substrate, so the substrate molecule breaks up more easily.chemical reaction beginsactivation ener^y_neede_d _ without enzymeenergy is released as the product is formedTime- chemical reaction without enzyme-chemicalreactionwithenzymeThe \u2018L o c k  and K e y \u2019 Model is a Good Start...Enzymes are a bit picky \u2014 they only work with substrates that fit their active site. Early scientists studying the action of enzymes came up with the lock and key' model. This is where the substrate fits into the enzyme in the same way that a key fits into a lock.enzyme is unchanged\ncomplexScientists soon realised that the lock and key model didn't give the full story. The enzyme and substrate do have to fit together in the first place, but new evidence showed that the enzyme-substrate complex changed shape slightly to complete the fit. This locks the substrate even more tightly to the enzyme. Scientists modified the old lock and key model and came up with the 'induced fit' model.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","40":"56Gas ExchangeLots of organisms have developed adaptations to improve their rate of gas exchange. It's a tricky business if you're an insect or a plant though \u2014 you've got to exchange enough gas but avoid losing all your water and drying to a crisp...Gas Exchange Surfaces have Two Major AdaptationsMost gas exchange surfaces have two things in common:1) They have a large surface area.2) They're thin (often just one layer of epithelial cells)\u2014 this provides a short diffusion pathway across the gas exchange surfaceThe organism also maintains a steep concentration gradient of gases across the exchange surface.All these features increase the rate of diffusion \u2014see page 39.Single-celled Organisms Exchange Gases across their Body Surface1) Single-celled organisms absorb and release gases by diffusion through their outer surface.2) They have a relatively large surface area, a thin surface and a short diffusion pathway (oxygen can take part in biochemical reactions as soon as it diffuses into the cell)\u2014 so there's no need for a gas exchange system.Fish Use a Counter-Current System for Gas ExchangeThere's a lower concentration of oxygen in water than in air. So fish have special adaptations to get enough of it.1) Water, containing oxygen, enters the fish through its mouth and passes out through the gills.2) Each gill is made of lots of thin plates called gill filaments, which give a big surface area for exchange of gases.3) The gill filaments are covered in lots of tiny structures called artcry ___^ \/(plural = lamellae)lamellae, which increase the surface area even more.4) The lamellae have lots of blood capillaries and a thin surface layer of cells to speed up diffusion.artery (deoxygenated blood to gill)artery (oxygenated blood from the gill)lamella\nblood leaves lamella with high oxygen conc.Water flowing towards the lamella (relatively high oxygen conc.'blood enters lamella with low oxygen conc.Water flowing away from the lamella (relatively low oxygen conc.)gill filaments5) Blood flows through the lamellae in one direction and water flows over in the opposite direction. This is called a counter-current system. It maintains a large concentration gradient between the water and the blood. The concentration of oxygen in the water is always higher than that in the blood, so as much oxygen as possible diffuses from the water into the blood.Insects use Tracheae to Exchange Gasesdistance along gill platetracheae and tracheoles give large surface area1) Insects have microscopic air-filled pipes calledtracheae which they use for gas exchange. fe2) Air moves into the tracheae through pores on the surface called spiracles3) Oxygen travels down the concentration gradient towards the cells.4) The tracheae branch off into smaller tracheoles which have thin, permeable walls and go to individual cells. This means that oxygen diffuses directly into the respiring cells \u2014 the insect's circulatory system doesn't transport Or5) Carbon dioxide from the cells moves down its own concentration gradient towards the spiracles to be released into the atmosphere.6) Insects use rhythmic abdominal movements to move air in and out of the spiraclesspiracletracheole lined with single layer of cells to minimise diffusion distanceOj diffuses into respiring cellsCO, diffuses into tracheal tubesTopic 3 A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","41":"Joint ventures\nTh ese are not the same as a merger, but they can lead to \nmergers of the businesses if their joint interests coincide \nand if the joint venture is successful.

Polysaccharides \ndo not have the sweet taste of  many mono- and disaccharides, but these complex polymers include some very important biological molecules.\nMolecules with between 3 and 10 sugar units are known as oligosaccharides, while molecules \ncontaining 11 or more monosaccharides are known as true polysaccharides. The glycosidic bonds in the polysaccharide can be broken to release monosaccharide units for cellular respiration.\nThe glycosidic bond between two glucose units is split by a process known as hydrolysis (see fig\u00a0A).  \nThe hydrolysis reaction is the opposite of  the condensation reaction that created the molecule, so water \nis added to the bond. Starch and glycogen are gradually broken down into shorter and shorter chains and eventually single sugars are left. Disaccharides break down to form two monosaccharides.

Harsh I know.Before You Start Planning, Be Clear on What You\u2019re Trying to Find OutLike all scientists, you should start off by making a prediction or hypothesis \u2014 a specific testable statement, based on theory, about what will happen in the experiment. You then need to plan a good experiment that will provide evidence to support the prediction \u2014 or help disprove it.A Good Experiment Gives Results that are...D\\\\l I U I \\ I I I II 1\/ r I l My Z Precise results are 3 - sometimes referred - Z to as reliable results, c \"W; 111111 ii 1 if 11111Precise \u2014 precise results don't vary much from the mean. Precision is reduced by random error (the unpredictable way in which all measurements vary).Repeatable and reproducible \u2014 repeatable means that if the same person repeats the experiment using the same methods and equipment, they will get the same results. Reproducible means that if someone different does the experiment, using a slightly different method or piece of equipment, the results will still be the same. Valid \u2014 valid results answer the original question. To get valid results you need to control all the variables (see below) to make sure you're only testing the thing you want to.Accurate \u2014 accurate results are really close to the true answer. Human interpretation of a measurement (e.g. determining a colour change) can reduce the accuracy of results.Here are some things you need to consider when designing a good experiment:2)3)4)D2)EXAMPLE:3)Only one variable should be changed \u2014Variables are quantities that have the potential to change, e.g. pH. In an experiment you usually change one variable and measure its effect on another variable.\u2022 The variable that you change is called the independent variable.\u2022 The variable that you measure is called the dependent variable.All the other variables should be controlled \u2014When you're investigating a variable you need to keep everything else that could affect it constant.This means you can be sure that only your independent variable is affecting the thing you're measuring (the dependent variable).Negative controls should be used \u2014Negative controls are used to check that only the independent variable is affecting the dependent variable. Negative controls aren't expected to have any effect on the experiment.1)2)3)4)5)4)Investigating the effect of light intensity on rate of photosynthesis of Canadian pondweedLight intensity is the independent variable.Rate of photosynthesis is the dependent variable. pH, temperature and the time the pondweed is left should all stay the same (and the quantities should be recorded to allow someone else to reproduce the experiment).The experiment should be repeated at least three times for each light intensity used.A negative control, in which the experiment is carried out in the dark, should also be used.No photosynthesis should happen with this control.The experiment should be repeated at least three times and a mean should be calculated \u2014 this reduces the effect of random error on your experiment, which makes your results more precise. Doing repeats and getting similar results each time also shows that your data is repeatable and makes it more likely to be reproducible.Examiners love getting you to comment on experimental design or suggest improvements to methods \u2014 e.g. how a method could be improved to make the results more precise. So make sure you know how to design a good experiment.Select Appropriate Apparatus, Equipment and Techniques1) When you're planning an experiment you need to decide what it is you're going to measure and how often you're going to take measurements. E.g. if you're investigating the rate of respiration, you could either measure the volume of oxygen used over time or the volume of carbon dioxide produced over time. You could take measurements at, e.g. 30 second intervals or 60 second intervals.2) Then you need to choose the most appropriate apparatus, equipment and techniques for the experiment. E.g.\u2022 The measuring apparatus you use has to be sensitive enough to measure the changes you're looking for.For example, if you need to measure small changes in pH, a pH meter (which can measure pH to several decimal places) would be more sensitive than indicator paper.\u2022 The technique you use has to be the most appropriate one for your experiment. E.g. if you want to measure the concentration of glucose in an unknown solution, using a colorimeter in conjunction with quantitative Benedict's reagent (see page 151) will help you to get more accurate results than simply comparing the colour differences of the solutions by eye.Practical Skills\n","44":"39 1B.3 CIRCULATION IN THE BLOOD VESSELS MAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS\nsmooth inner surface\nouter tough layer consisting\nmainly of collagen \ufb01bresrelatively thin layer of smooth muscle with few elastic \ufb01bres\nrelatively large lumen\nvein\nartery\n\u25b2 fig D  T he arrangement of tissues in a vein reflects the pressure of blood  \nin the vessel.\nEventually only two veins (sometimes called the great veins) carry \nthe blood from the body tissues back to the heart \u2013 the inferior vena cava from the lower parts of  the body and the superior vena cava from the upper parts of  the body.\nVeins can hold a large volume of  blood \u2013 in fact more than half  of  \nthe body\u2019s blood volume is in the veins at any one time.

The graph below shows the release of a product over time:Volume of product released by an enzyme-controlled reaction at different temperatures\u201c 50 '\u00a9 First look at the start of the graph and compare the rates of reaction here. E.g. the rate of reaction is fastest at 65 \u00b0C. Use what you know about factors affecting enzyme activity to explain why (see p. 12). You might have to work out the initial rate of reaction (see below).i i(T) Nov\/ look at what else the graphs are showing you and make comparisons between the different temperatures. At 37 \u00b0C the graph has plateaued (flattened out) because all the substrate has been used up.At 65 \u00b0C the graph has plateaued earlier than at 37 \u00b0C, because the high temperature caused the enzyme to denature, so the reaction stopped sooner. Not as much product was made because not all the substrate was converted to product before the enzyme was denatured, so there is still substrate left.At 25 \u00b0C the rate of reaction is remaining constant and the volume of product is continuing to increase because not all of the substrate has been used up.You Can Use a Tangent to Calculate the Initial Rate of ReactionThe initial rate of reaction is the rate of reaction right at the start of the reaction, close to time equals zero (t = 0) on the graph.

OK, maybe that's not completely DNA's fault.

(For a recap on the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells see pages 24 and 28.)Nuclear Eukaryotic DNA is Linear and Associated with Proteins1)2)3)4)5)Eukaryotic cells contain linear DNA molecules that exist as chromosomes \u2014 thread-like structures, each made up of one long molecule of DNA. Chromosomes are found in the nucleus.The DNA molecule is really long so, it has to be wound up so it can fit into the nucleus.The DNA molecule is wound around proteins called histones.Histone proteins also help to support the DNA.The DNA (and protein) is then coiled up very tightly to make a compact chromosome.DNA double-helixDNA Histone proteins A single chromosomeDNA wound around histone proteinsDNA with the protein is coiled up repeatedly= Eukary\u00b0t'c cells include - Z a\"'\u2122al and p|ant ce|)s r r \u201cr\u00b0karyotir cells are -My bacteria. =1111 111 111 i\\\\~6)The mitochondria and chloroplasts in eukaryotic cells also have their own DNA.

It's the order of bases in a gene that determines the order of amino acids in a particular polypeptide.4) Each amino acid is coded for by a sequence of three bases in a gene called a triplet, i :-^5s>5) To make a polypeptide, DNA is first copied into messenger RNA (mRNA).This is the first stage of protein synthesis (see p. 84).6) Genes that don't code for a polypeptide code for functional RNA instead.

Ecosystems have developed a much better system to make sure necessary elements like nitrogen and phosphorus can be recycled and don't run out.Fungi and Bacteria Have an Important Role in Nutrient Recycling1) A natural ecosystem is one that hasn't been changed by human activity. In natural ecosystems nutrients are recycled though the food webs, but human activity often disrupts the cycling of nutrients.2) Microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, are an important part of food webs. Many are saprobionts (a type of decomposer) \u2014 they feed on the remains of dead plants and animals and on their waste products (faeces, urine), breaking them down. This allows important chemical elements in the remains to be recycled.3) Saprobionts secrete enzymes and digest their food externally, then absorb the nutrients they need. This is known as extracellular digestion. During this process, organic molecules are broken down into inorganic ions. Obtaining nutrients from dead organic matter using extracellular digestion is known as saprobiotic nutrition.4) Some fungi form symbiotic relationships with the roots of plants. These relationships are known as mycorrhizae.\u2022 The fungi are made up of long, thin strands called hyphae, which connect to the plant's roots.\u2022 The hyphae greatly increase the surface area of the plant's root system, helping the plant to absorb ions from the soil that are usually scarce (e.g. phosphorus). Hyphae also increase the uptake of water by the plant.\u2022 In turn, the fungi obtain organic compounds, such as glucose, from the plant.The Nitrogen Cycle shows how Nitrogen is Recycled in EcosystemsPlants and animals need nitrogen to make proteins and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). The atmosphere's made up of about 78% nitrogen gas, but plants and animals can't use it in that form \u2014 they need bacteria to convert it into nitrogen-containing compounds first. The nitrogen cycle shows how nitrogen is converted into a usable form and then passed on between different living organisms and the non-living environment.The nitrogen cycle includes food chains (nitrogen is passed on when organisms are eaten), and four different processes that involve bacteria \u2014 nitrogen fixation, ammonification, nitrification and denitrification:(T) Nitrogen fixation\u00a3AtmosphericnitrogenThe Nitrogen CycleNitrogen compounds plantsNitrogen fixation is when nitrogen gas in theatmosphere is turned into nitrogen-containing __________________ ____compounds. Biological nitrogen fixation is carried out (denitrifigmion) by bacteria such as Rhizobium. They turn nitrogen into ammonia, which goes on to form ammonium ions in solution that can then be used by plants.Rhizobium are found inside root nodules (growths on the roots) of leguminous plants (e.g. peas, beans and clover).They form a mutualistic relationship with the plants \u2014 they provide the plant with nitrogen compounds and the plant provides them with carbohydrates.(NITROGEN FIXATION 'Nitrogen compounds in animalsfAMMONIFICATION (by saprobionts)]----------V\u20147&----------Ammonia^Ammonium ions\u00a9AmmonificationAmmonification is when nitrogen compounds from dead organisms are turned into ammonia by saprobionts,which goes on to form ammonium ions.

This could make the whole crop vulnerable to the same disease because the plants are genetically identical. Environmentalists are also concerned about monocultures reducing biodiversity, as this could damage the environment.Some people are concerned about the possibility of 'superweeds' \u2014 weeds that are resistant to herbicides. These could occur if transformed crops interbreed with wild plants. There could then be an uncontrolled spread of recombinant DNA, with unknown consequences.Organic farmers can have their crops contaminated by wind-blown seeds from nearby genetically modified crops. This means they can't sell their crop as organic and may lose their income.IndustryAnti-globalisation activists oppose globalisation (e.g. the growth of large multinational companies at the expense of smaller ones). A few, large biotechnology companies control some forms of genetic engineering. As the use of this technology increases, these companies get bigger and more powerful. This may force smaller companies out of business, e.g. by making it harder for them to compete. Without proper labelling, some people think they won't have a choice about whether to consume food made using genetically engineered organisms.Some consumer markets, such as the EU, won't import GM foods and products. This can cause an economic loss to producers who have traditionally sold to those markets.MedicineCompanies who own genetic engineering technologies may limit the use of technologies that could be saving lives.Some people worry this technology could be used unethically, e.g. to make designer babies (babies that have characteristics chosen by their parents). This is currently illegal though.Recombinant DNA technology also creates ownership issues. Here are some examples:\u2022 There is some debate about who owns genetic material from humans once it has been removed from the body \u2014 the donor or the researcher. Some people argue that the individual holds the right to their own genetic information, however others argue that value is created by the researcher who uses it to develop a medicine or in diagnosis.\u2022 A small number of large corporations own patents to particular seeds. They can charge high prices, sometimes including a 'technology fee', and can require farmers to repurchase seeds each year.If non-GM crops are contaminated by GM crops, farmers can be sued for breaching the patent law....But Humanitarians Think it will Benefit PeopleRecombinant DNA technology has many potential humanitarian benefits:1) Agricultural crops could be produced that help reduce the risk of famine and malnutrition, e.g. drought-resistant crops for drought-prone areas.2) Transformed crops could be used to produce useful pharmaceutical products (e.g. vaccines) which could make drugs available to more people, e.g. in areas where refrigeration (usually needed for storing vaccines) isn't available.3) Mcdicines could be produced more chcaply, so more people can afford them.4) Recombinant DNA technology has the potential to be used in gene therapy to treat human diseases (see next page).>0U need to be able z- to balance the humanitarian : r h\/neflts opposing views =- from environmentalists and ~ S ant|-9|obalisat,on activists r(see above) -Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n","50":"164Topic 7B \u2014 Populations and EvolutionThe Hardy-Weinberg PrincipleSometimes you need to look at the genetics of a whole population, rather than a cross between just two individuals.

It predicts that the frequencies of alleles in a population won't change from one generation to the next.2) But this prediction is only true under certain conditions \u2014 it has to be a large population where there's no immigration, emigration, mutations or natural selection. There also needs to be random mating \u2014 all possible genotypes can breed with all others.3) The Hardy-Weinberg equations (see below) can be used to calculate the frequency of particular alleles, genotypes and phenotypes within populations.4) The equations can also be used to test whether or not the Hardy-Weinberg principle applies to particular alleles in particular populations, i.e. to test whether selection or any other factors are influencing allele frequencies.\u2014 if frequencies do change between generations in a large population then there is an influence of some kind.The Hardy-Weinberg Equations Can be Used to Predict Allele Frequency...When a gene has two alleles, you can figure out the frequency of one of the alleles of the gene if you know the frequency of the other allele, using this equation:Where: p = the frequency of one allele, usually the dominant oneq = the frequency of the other allele, usually the recessive oneThe total frequency of all possible alleles for a characteristic in a certain population is lO. So the frequencies of the individual alleles (e.g. the dominant one and the recessive one) must add up to 1.0.E.g. a species of plant has either red or white flowers.

The diffusion rate is quick because of the small distances the substances have to travel (see p. 39).2) In multicellular animals, diffusion across the outer membrane is too slow, for two reasons:\u2022 Some cells are deep within the body \u2014 there's a big distance between them and the outside environment.\u2022 Larger animals have a low surface area to volume ratio \u2014 it's difficult to exchange enough substances to supply a large volume of animal through a relatively small outer surface.So rather than using straightforward diffusion to absorb and excrete substances, multicellular animals need specialised exchange organs (like lungs \u2014 see p. 58).They also need an efficient system to carry substances to and from their individual cells \u2014 this is mass transport.In mammals, 'mass transport' normally refers to the circulatory system (see p. 70), which uses blood to carry glucose and oxygen around the body. It also carries hormones, antibodies (p. 44) and waste like CO,.Mass transport in plants involves the transport of water and solutes in the xylem and phloem (see pages 78 and 80).Topic 3 A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","52":"128 Topic 6A \u2014 Stimuli and ResponsesNervous CommunicationYour body has an amazing network of nerve cells which constantly send electrical signals \u2014 a bit like a big circuit board.Responding to their Environment Helps Organisms Survive1) Animals increase their chances of survival by responding to changes in their external environment, e.g. by avoiding harmful environments such as places that are too hot or too cold.2) They also respond to changes in their internal environment to make sure that the conditionsare always optimal for their metabolism (ail the chemical reactions that go on inside them).3) Plants also increase their chances of survival by responding to changes in their environment (see p. 130).4) Any change in the internal or external environment is called a stimulus.Receptors Detect Stimuli and Effectors Produce a Response1) Receptors detect stimuli \u2014 they can be cells or proteins on cell surface membranes. ^1'1\" M 1\" 1\" \" \\There are loads of different types of receptors that detect different stimuli. 5 ^^jftype^f stimulus '2) Effectors are cells that bring about a response to a stimulus, to produce an effect. ; _ see p. 132.Effectors include muscle cells and cells found in glands, e.g. the pancreas.

But when a female carrier and a male without colour-blindness have children (as in this example), only their male offspring are at risk of being colour-blind. So you can also say that there's a predicted 2:1:1 ratio \u2014 of female offspring without colour-blindness : male offspring without colour-blindness : male offspring with colour-blindness.8) This ratio will change if a female carrier (XNXn) and a male with colour-blindness (XnY) have children.The predicted ratio will then be 1 : 1 \u2014 of offspring with colour-blindness : offspring without colour-blindness. The ratio will be the same for offspring of each gender. You only end up with this predicted ratio for a monohybrid F, cross with a sex-linked characteristic.Some Autosomal Genes are LinkedD2)Autosome is the fancy name for any chromosome that isn't a sex chromosome.Autosomal genes are the genes located on the autosomes.Genes on the same autosome are said to be linked \u2014 because they're on the same autosome they'll stay together during the independent segregation of chromosomes in meiosis I, and their alleles will be passed on to the offspring together. The only reason this won't happen is if crossing over splits them up first3) The closer together two genes are on the autosome,the more closely they are said to be linked. This is because Genes A, B crossing over is less likely to split them up. T ^4) If two genes are autosomally linked, you won't get the ~ phenotypic ratio you expect in the offspring of a cross.5) For example, in a dihybrid cross between two heterozygous parents you'd expect a 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 ratio in the offspring (see previous page). Instead, the phenotypic ratio is more likely to be that expected for a monohybrid cross between two heterozygous parents (3:1) because the two autosomally-linked alleles are inherited together. This means that a higher proportion of the offspring will have their parents' (heterozygous) genotype and phenotype.6) This allows you to use the predicted phenotypic ratio to identify autosomal linkage.Topic 7A \u2014 Geneticsand C are all linked.Crossing over is when two homologous (paired) chromosomes swap bits'. It happens in meiosis I before independent segregation.

Here's what happens next...The Link Reaction converts Pyruvate to Acetyl Coenzyme A1) Pyruvate is decarboxylated (one carbon atom is removed from pyruvate in the form of C02).2) Pyruvate is oxidised to form acetate and NAD is reduced to form reduced NAD.3) Acetate is combined with coenzyme A (CoA) to form acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA).4) No ATP is produced in this reaction.coenzyme A (CoA) \u201cpyruvate|3C|co?

It actually measures water uptake by a plant, but it's assumed that water uptake by the plant is directly related to water loss by the leaves. You can use it to estimate how different factors affect the transpiration rate.Here's what you'd do:Cut a shoot underwater to prevent air from entering the xylem. Cut it at a slant to increase the surface area available for water uptake.Assemble the potometer in water and insert the shoot underwater, so no air can enter.Remove the apparatus from the water but keep the end of the capillary tube submerged in a beaker of water. Check that the apparatus is watertight and airtight.Dry the leaves, allow time for the shoot to acclimatise, and then shut the tap.Remove the end of the capillary tube from the beaker of water until one air bubble has formed, then put the end of the tube back into the water.Record the starting position of the air bubble.Start a stopwatch and record the distance moved by the bubble per unit time, e.g. per hour. The rate of air bubble movement is an estimate of the transpiration rate.Remember, only change one variable (e.g. temperature) at a time. All other conditions (e.g. light, humidity) must be kept constant.You Might Have to Dissect PlantsYou can look at xylem or phloem in plant tissue (e.g. part of a plant stem) under a microscope, and then draw them. But first you need to dissect the plant and prepare a section of the tissue. You can do this using the following method:1) Use a scalpel (or razor blade) to cut a cross-section of the stem. Cut the sections as thinly as possible \u2014 thin sections are better for viewing under a microscope.2) Use tweezers to gently place the cut sections in water until you come to use them. This stops them from drying out.3) Transfer each section to a dish containing a stain, e.g. toluidine blue O (TBO), and leave for one minute. TBO stains the lignin in the walls of the xylem vessels blue-green.This will let you see the position of the xylem vessels and examine their structure.4) Rinse off the sections in water and mount each one onto a slide (see page 30).Practice QuestionsQ1 What is the function of xylem tissue?Q2 Give four factors that affect transpiration rate.Q3 Name a piece of apparatus used to measure transpiration rate.Exam QuestionQ1 a) What is meant by the term transpiration?

Here are two examples.\nWarfarin is an anticoagulant that interferes with the \nmanufacture of  prothrombin in the body. Low prothrombin levels make the blood clot less easily (see Section 1B.2). Warfarin has been used in rat poison \u2013 in high doses the blood will not clot at all and the rats bleed to death after the slightest injury. In humans, the dose is carefully monitored to make sure that the clotting of  the blood is reduced but not prevented completely. \nPlatelet inhibitory drugs make the platelets less sticky, and \nso reduce the clotting ability of  the blood. The cheapest and most common of  these is aspirin (fig D) but clopidogrel is also commonly used. \n\u25b2 fig D  Aspirin is a r elatively cheap drug. It has been used traditionally  \nas a painkiller. It is also a very effective way of preventing many \ncardiovascular problems.\nThe risks of  taking aspirin are well known \u2013 it irritates the \nstomach lining and causes bleeding in the stomach which can become serious. A combination of  aspirin and clopidogrel can reduce the risk of  developing a range of  cardiovascular diseases by 20\u201325% in some low-risk patients. However, based on data from several studies it appears that, for some patients, the risk of  side-effects is much higher when the two drugs are combined. For example, for every 1000 patients at high risk of  CVDs treated for 28 months, five cardiovascular events would be avoided \u2013 but three major stomach bleeds would be caused. In lower-risk patients, 23 cardiovascular events would be avoided while 10 major bleeds would be caused. It is difficult to achieve the correct balance between preventing the blood from clotting too easily while allowing it to clot when necessary. For example, when people are treated with anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin, they must be monitored very carefully to make sure that they do not bleed internally, particularly in the brain. The decision whether to give warfarin will depend on many factors, including the patient\u2019s age and condition as well as other medication they may be taking.\nCHECKPOINT \n1.

Natural selection affects different populations in different ways, as you'll soon discover...Different Types of Natural Selection Lead to Different Frequency PatternsYou might remember from the previous page that natural selection alters allele frequency in a population. Stabilising selection and directional selection are types of natural selection that affect allele frequencyin different ways. You need to learn these examples:Antibiotic Resistance Shows Directional SelectionDirectional selection is where individuals with alleles for characteristics of an extreme type are more likely to survive and reproduce. This could be in response to an environmental change. Bacteria evolving antibiotic resistance is an example of directional selection. Here's how it works:1) Some individuals in a population have alleles that give them resistance to an antibiotic.2) The population is exposed to the antibiotic, killing bacteria without the resistant allele.3) The resistant bacteria survive and reproduce without competition, passing on the allele that gives antibiotic resistance to their offspring.4) After some time, most organisms in the population will carry the antibiotic resistance allele.PARENTSik totali iton$3T5population \/\"rrs\\ breeding ^\u0000>_CA-^population ^o\/ \\ l=^> t<y_Ci1 \\ \/ \\\u00a3c\/ \\ \u00a3 \\ 3 \\ C---------^ . \u0000OFFSPRING\nlowantibiotic resistancehighantibiotic resistanceHuman Birth Weight Shows Stabilising SelectionStabilising selection is where individuals with alleles for characteristics towards the middle of the range are more likely to survive and reproduce. It occurs when the environment isn't changing, and it reduces the range of possible characteristics. An example of stabilising selection is human birth weight.1) Humans have a range of birth weights.2) Very small babies are less likely to survive \u2014 partly because they find it hard to maintain their body temperature.3) Giving birth to large babies can be difficult, so large babies are less likely to survive too.4) Conditions are most favourable for medium-sized babies \u2014 so weight of human babies tends to shift towards the middle of the range.PARENTStotal populationbreedingpopulationOFFSPRING\nweight of babylight--!\"\u0000weight of baby hcav7You Need to be Able to Interpret Data on the Effects of SelectionYou might be asked to interpret information about an unfamiliar species in the exam.

This means the mineral ions that they contain (e.g. phosphates and nitrates) are not returned to the soil by decomposers in the nitrogen or phosphorus cycles.3) Phosphates and nitrates are also lost from the system when animals or animal productsare removed from the land. Animals eat grass and other plants, taking in their nutrients.When they are taken elsewhere for slaughter or transferred to a different field, the nutrients aren't replaced through their remains or waste products.Fertilisers are Added to Soils to Replace Lost NutrientsAdding fertiliser replaces the lost minerals, so more energy from the ecosystem can be used for growth, increasing the efficiency of energy transfer. Fertilisers can be artificial or natural.Artificial fertilisers are inorganic \u2014 they contain pure chemicals (e.g. ammonium nitrate) as powders or pellets.Natural fertilisers are organic matter \u2014 they include manure, composted vegetables, crop residues (the parts left over after the harvest) and sewage sludge.True, Daisy had a dippy fringe, but she sure could produce a lot of fertiliser.Using Fertilisers Raises Environmental Issues1) Sometimes more fertiliser is applied than the plants need or are able to use at a particular time.2) This can lead to the fertilisers leaching into waterways.3) Leaching is when water-soluble compounds in the soil are washed away, e.g. by rain or irrigation systems. They're often washed into nearby ponds and rivers.4) This can lead to eutrophication (see next page).5) Leaching is more likely to occur if the fertiliser is applied just before heavy rainfall.6) Inorganic ions in chemical fertilisers are relatively soluble. This means that excess minerals that are not used immediately are more likely to leach into waterways. In natural fertilisers, the nitrogen and phosphorus are still contained in organic molecules that need to be decomposed by microorganisms before they can be absorbed by plants. This means that their release into the soil for uptake by plants is more controlled, and leaching is less likely.7) The leaching of phosphates is less likely than the leaching of nitrates because phosphates are less soluble in water.8) Using fertilisers also changes the balance of nutrients in the soil \u2014too much of a particular nutrient can cause crops and other plants to die.Topic 5B \u2014 Energy Transfer and Nutrient Cycles\n","61":"66 Topic 3BMore Exchange and Transport SystemsDigestion and AbsorptionThe whole point of digestion is to break down the food you eat into small molecules that your cells can absorb. As you might imagine, this involves loads of different chemical reactions and our old friends, enzymes.Food is Broken Down into Smaller Molecules During Digestion1) The large biological molecules (e.g. starch, proteins) in food are too big to cross cell membranes.This means they can't be absorbed from the gut into the blood.2) During digestion, these large molecules are broken down into smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, amino acids), which can move across cell membranes. This means they can be easily absorbed from the gut into the blood, to be transported around the body for use by the body cells.3) You might remember from Topic 1 A, that most large biological molecules are polymers, which can be broken down into smaller molecules (monomers) using hydrolysis reactions.Hydrolysis reactions break bonds by adding water.4) During hydrolysis, carbohydrates are broken down into disaccharides and then monosaccharides.Fats are broken down into fatty acids and monoglycerides. Proteins are broken down into amino acids.Digestive Enzymes are Used to Break Down Biological Molecules in Food1) A variety of different digestive enzymes are produced by specialised cells in the digestive systems of mammals. These enzymes are then released into the gut to mix with food.2) Since enzymes only work with specific substrates (see page 11), different enzymes are needed to catalyse the breakdown of different food molecules.Carbohydrates are Broken Down by Amylase and Membrane-Bound Disaccharidases1) Amylase is a digestive enzyme that catalyses the conversion of starch (a polysaccharide) into the smaller sugar maltose (a disaccharide). This involves the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds in starch.2) Amylase is produced by the salivary glands (which release amylase into the mouth) and also by the pancreas (which releases amylase into the small intestine).3) Membrane-bound disaccharidases are enzymes that are attached to the cell membranes of epithelial cellslining the ileum (the final part of the small intestine). They help to break down disaccharides (e.g. maltose, sucrose and lactose) into monosaccharides (e.g. glucose, fructose and galactose).

They work in the small intestine.3) Bile salts are produced by the liver and emulsify lipids \u2014 this means they cause the lipids to form small droplets.4) Bile salts are really important in the process of lipid digestion. Several small lipid droplets have a bigger surface area than a single large droplet (for the same volume of lipid). So the formation of small droplets greatly increases the surface area of lipid that's available for lipases to work on.\u00a3 monoglyceride is a C- glycerol molecule with \u00a3 ~ one fatty acid attached =\nemulsificationbile saltsbiglipid dropletA \/V,\/ lipase digestion\u00b0o\u00b0of lipidsmall lipid dropletsmonoglycerides & fatty acids \u00b00\u00b0\u00b00 micelles5) Once the lipid has been broken down, the monoglycerides and fatty acids stick with the bile salts to form tiny structures called micelles.Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n","62":"73The HeartThe Cardiac Cycle Pumps Blood Round the BodyThe cardiac cycle is an ongoing sequence of contraction and relaxation of the atria and ventricles that keeps blood continuously circulating round the body. The volume of the atria and ventricles changes as they contract and relax. Pressure changes also occur, due to the changes in chamber volume (e.g. decreasing the volume of a chamber by contraction will increase the pressure in a chamber). The cardiac cycle can be simplified into three stages:\u00a9 ( Ventricles relax, atria contract )The ventricles are relaxed.The atria contract, decreasing the volume of the chambers and increasing the pressure inside the chambers. This pushes the blood into the ventricles. There's a slight increase in ventricular pressure and chamber volume as the ventricles receive the ejected blood from the contracting atria.\u00a9AtriaSL valves closed\nAV valves are open\\ \/( Ventricles contract, atria relax )The atria relax. The ventricles contract (decreasing their volume), increasing their pressure. The pressure becomes higher in the ventricles than the atria, which forces the AV valves shut to prevent back-flow. The pressure in the ventricles is also higher than in the aorta and pulmonary artery, which forces open the SL valves and blood is forced out into these arteries.\\ \/(Ventricles relax, atria relax\")The ventricles and the atria both relax.The higher pressure in the pulmonary artery and aorta closes the SL valves to prevent back-flow into the ventricles. Blood returns to the heart and the atria fill again due to the higher pressure in the vena cava and pulmonary vein. In turn this starts to increase the pressure of the atria. As the ventricles continue to relax, their pressure falls below the pressure of the atria and so the AV valves open. This allows blood to flow passively (without being pushed by atrial contraction) into the ventricles from the atria. The atria contract, and the whole process begins again.pulmonaryu n 111 w 1111 r I H \/~ Cardiac contraction \u2014 \u201c is also called systole IT- and relaxation is - called diastole. ~\nblood leaves via pulmonary arteryVentriclescontractSL valves forced openblood leaves via aorta\nAV valves forced closed\nAtria and ventriclesrelaxblood re-enters via vena cavaSL valves forced closedblood re-enters via pulmonaryAV valves forced openThere's a bit about interpreting cardiac cycle data on the next page.

This can lead to classification systems being updated. Technologies that have been useful for clarifying evolutionary relationships include:Genome sequencing \u2014 Advances in genome sequencing have meant that the entire base sequence of an organism's DNA can be determined. The DNA base sequence of one organism can then be compared to the DNA base sequence of another organism, to see how closely related they are. Closely related species will have a higher percentage of similarity in their DNA base order, e.g. humans and chimps share around 94%, humans and mice share about 86%.Genome sequencing has clarified the relationship between skunks and members of the Mustelidae family (e.g. weasels and badgers). Skunks were classified in the Mustelidae family until their DNA sequence was revealed to be significantly different to other members of that family. So they were reclassified into the family Mephitidae.Comparing amino acid sequence \u2014 Proteins are made of amino acids. The sequence of amino acids in a protein is coded for by the base sequence in DNA (see p. 82). Related organisms have similar DNA sequences and so similar amino acid sequences in their proteins. E.g. cytochrome C is a short protein found in many species. The more similar the amino acid sequence of cytochrome C in two different species, the more closely related the species are likely to be.Immunological comparisons \u2014 Similar proteinswill also bind the same antibodies (see p. 44).

Y our lifestyle can affect your \nrisk of  developing atherosclerosis in the future. Epidemiological studies have shown links with smoking, diet and weight, lack of  activity and high blood pressure. These are the factors we can change, so we can change our risk of  developing CVDs by the lifestyle choices we make.\nSMOKING AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nStudies have shown that smokers are far more likely to develop atherosclerosis than non-smokers with a similar lifestyle. Nine out of  ten people who need heart bypass surgery or stents as a result of  atherosclerosis are smokers. In 2007, a Spanish study showed a clear correlation between smoking and the incidence of  death from atherosclerotic heart disease. Causation was established by further research. For example, studies found that the substances in tobacco smoke:\n \u2022can dama\nge the artery linings, which makes the build-up of  plaques more likely\n \u2022can cause the ar\nteries to narrow, raise the blood pressure and increase the risk of  atherosclerosis.\nSimilar findings were made in a study on adults with heart disease in Jordan in 2017 (see fig B).1.16 1.12\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Sperm cells have a tail to propel \nthem towards the ovum (Figure 1.10). They have a relatively large \nnumber of mitochondria to release the energy from glucose during \nrespiration. This is needed to keep them swimming. The nucleus of a \nhuman sperm contains the genetic material (DNA) of the father. This \nwill make up half of the DNA of the baby.

This means you can't use an optical microscope to view organelles smaller than 0.2 pm. That includes ribosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes. You may be able to make out mitochondria \u2014 but not in perfect detail.

Stains are used to highlight objects in a cell. For example, eosin is used to make the cytoplasm show up. Iodine in potassium iodide solution (see p. 4) is used to stain starch grains in plant cells.\u2022 Finally, add the cover slip (a square of clear plastic that protects the specimen). To do so, stand the slip upright on the slide, next to the water droplet.

Proteins make \nhair, skin and nails, the enzymes needed for metabolism and digestion, and many of  the hormones that control the different body systems. They enable muscle fibres to contract, make antibodies that protect you from disease, help clot your blood and transport oxygen in the form of  haemoglobin. Understanding the structure of  proteins helps you understand the detailed biology of  cells and organisms. Like carbohydrates and lipids, proteins contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. In addition, they all contain nitrogen and many proteins also contain sulfur.\nProteins are a group of  macromolecules made up of  many \nsmall monomer units called amino acids joined together by condensation reactions. Amino acids combine in long chains to produce proteins. There are about 20 different naturally occurring amino acids that can combine in different ways to produce a wide range of  different proteins.\nAMINO ACIDS\nAll amino acids have the same basic structure, which is represented as a general formula. There is always an amino group (\u2013NH\n2) and a carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) attached to a carbon \natom (see fig A). The group known as the R group varies between amino acids. Some amino acids contain sulfur and selenium in their R group. The R groups are not involved in the reactions which join the amino acids together, but the structure of  the R group does affect the way the amino acid interacts with others within the protein molecule. This will mainly depend on whether the R\u00a0group is polar or not, and these interactions affect the tertiary structure of  the protein formed (see page 18).\nThis part is common \nto all amino acids and \nis just shown as a \nshaded rectangle in the examples below.general formula\nglycine cysteineN HR\nH HCC OH\nO\nHC H2SH\n \n\u25b2 fig A  Some differ ent amino acids.

They join in a condensation reaction and a molecule of  water is released. A peptide bond is formed when two amino acids join, and a dipeptide is the result (see fig B). The R group is not involved in this reaction. More and more amino acids join to form polypeptide chains, which contain from about 100 to many thousands of  amino acids. A polypeptide forms a protein when the structure of  the chain changes by folding or coiling or associates with other polypeptide chains.\namino acid 1\ndipeptidepeptide\nbondamino acid 2 (inverted)\nOH + OH N H\nH HCC\nON HHH\nCCO\nOH N H\nH HC C\nONHH\nCCOcondensation hydrolysisR1\nR1R2\nR2H2O H2O\n\u25b2 fig B  Amino acids ar e the building blocks of proteins, joined together  \nby peptide bonds.\nBONDS IN PROTEINS\nThe peptide bond between amino acids is a strong bond.

This means the substrate won't fit into the active site, an enzyme-substrate complex won't be formed and the enzyme will no longer be able to carry out its function.6) The tertiary structure of an enzyme may be altered by changes in pH or temperature (see next page).7) The primary structure (amino acid sequence) of a protein is determined by a gene. If a mutation occurs in that gene (see p. 91), it could change the tertiary structure of the enzyme produced.Practice QuestionsQ1 What is an enzyme?Q2 What is the name given to the amount of energy needed to start a reaction?Q3 What is an enzyme-substrate complex?Q4 Why can an enzyme only bind to one substance?[4 marks] [2 marks]Exam QuestionsQ1 Dcscribc the \u2018induced fit\u2019 model of enzyme action.Q2 Explain how a change in the amino acid sequence of an enzyme may prevent it from functioning properly.But why is the enzyme-substrate complex?So enzymes lower the activation energy of a reaction.

If directors are \naggressive in pursuit of their aims, are keen to take over \nor defeat rival businesses and care little about social or \nenvironmental factors, then the objectives of the business \nwill be very di ff erent to those of a business owned and \ncontrolled by directors with a more people- or social-\noriented culture.\nThe size and legal form of the business\nOwners of small businesses may be concerned only with \na satisfactory level of pro fi t\u00a0\u2013 called \u2018satis fi cing\u2019.

The aims of these organisations can \nvary greatly, but when the service they provide is not \ncharged for, such as education and health services, \nthen a financial target would be inappropriate.

This causcs the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release stored calcium ions (Ca2+) into the sarcoplasm.3) Calcium ions bind to a protein attached toCa * binds to a protein, which moves tropomyosinmyosin head_ binds to the exposed siteactin-myosin cross bridge formedtropomyosin, causing the protein to change shape.

A new actin-myosin cross bridge is formed and the cycle is repeated (attach, move, detach, reattach to new binding site...)10) Many cross bridges form and break very rapidly, pulling the actin filament along \u2014 which shortens the sarcomere, causing the muscle to contract11) The cycle will continue as long as calcium ions are present.movement7)8)9)cross bridge breaksmyosin head reattaches to the next binding siteWhen Excitation Stops, Calcium Ions Leave1) When the muscle stops being stimulated, calcium ions leave their binding sites and are moved by active transport back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (this needs ATP too).2) This causes the tropomyosin molecules to move back, so they block the actin-myosin binding sites again.3) Muscles aren't contracted because no myosin heads are attached mm to actin filaments (so there are no actin-myosin cross bridges).4) The actin filaments slide back to their relaxed position, which lengthens the sarcomere.actin filaments slide backtropomyosin blocks the binding sites againTopic 6B \u2014 Nervous Coordination\n","80":"70The Circulatory SystemAs the name suggests, the circulatory system is responsible for circulating stuff around the body \u2014 blood, to be specific. Most multicellular organisms (mammals, insects, fish) have a circulatory system of some type.The Circulatory System is a Mass Transport System1) Multicellular organisms, like mammals, have a low surface area to volume ratio (see p. 54), so they need a specialised transport system to carry raw materials from specialised exchange organs to their body cells \u2014 this is the circulatory system.2) The circulatory system is made up of the heart and blood vessels.3) The heart pumps blood through blood vessels (arteries,arterioles, veins and capillaries) to reach different parts of the body. You need to know the names of all the bloodvessels entering and leaving the heart, lungs and kidneys.-4) Blood transports respiratory gases, products of digestion, metabolic wastes and hormones round the body.There are two circuits.One circuit takes blood from the heart to the lungs, then back to the heart.The other loop takes blood around the rest of the body.

Some protein molecules \nare joined with (conjugated to) another molecule called a prosthetic group (see fig\u00a0F). This structural feature usually affects the performance and functions of  the molecules. These molecules are called conjugated proteins. Haemoglobin is a large protein with iron as the prosthetic group. It is a conjugated protein as well as a globular protein. Lipoproteins are formed when proteins are conjugated with lipids \u2013 you will find out more about these important biological molecules when you look at factors affecting the health of  your heart in Chapter 1B.\nGlycoproteins are proteins with a carbohydrate prosthetic group. The carbohydrate part of  the \nmolecule helps them to hold a lot of  water and also makes it harder for protein-digesting enzymes (proteases) to break them down. Lots of  lubricants used by the human body \u2013 such as mucus and the synovial fluid in the joints \u2013 are glycoproteins. Their water-holding properties make them slippery and viscous, which reduces friction. This also helps to explain why the mucus produced in the stomach protects the protein walls from digestion.\nLipoproteins are very important in the transport of  cholesterol in the blood. The lipid part of  the \nmolecule enables it to combine with the lipid cholesterol. There are two main forms of  lipoproteins in your blood \u2013 low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) (around 22\n nm in diameter) and high-density \nlipopr\noteins (HDLs) (approximately 8\u201311\n nm in diameter). T\nhe HDLs contain more protein than \nLDLs, which is partly why they are denser \u2013 proteins are more compact molecules than lipids. Y ou will discover the impact of  different lipoproteins on the risk of  developing cardiovascular diseases  in Section 1C.4.\nPRACTICAL SKILLS CP2\nEXAM HINT\nRemember that amino acids are joined together by peptide bonds to make dipeptides and then \npolypeptides.

If heart muscle doesn't receive enough oxygen it can lead to a heart attack(see previous page).4) Smoking also decreases the amount of antioxidants in the blood \u2014 these are important for protecting cells from damage. Fewer antioxidants means cell damage in the coronary artery walls is more likely, and this can lead to atheroma formation.High blood pressure1) High blood pressure increases the risk of damage to the artery walls.2) Damaged walls have an increased risk of atheroma formation, causing a further increase in blood pressure.3) Atheromas can also cause blood clots to form (see previous page).4) A blood clot could block flow of blood to the heart muscle, possibly resulting in myocardial infarction.5) So anything that increases blood pressure also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, e.g. being overweight, not exercising and excessive alcohol consumption.~ ^ther factors include age ' - (risk increases with age) ~ 5 and sex (men are more at E -v risk than women) - IW||VV\"Most of these factors are within our control \u2014 a person can choose to smoke, eat fatty foods, etc. However, some risk factors can't be controlled, such as having a genetic predisposition to coronary heart disease or having high blood pressure as a result of another condition, e.g. some forms of diabetes. Even so, the risk of developing cardiovascular disease can be reduced by removing as many risk factors as you possibly can.Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n","83":"Most decisions have an ethical or moral dimension. \nFor\u00a0example:\n\u25a0 Should a toy company advertise its products to young \nchildren so that they pester their parents into buying \nthem?\n\u25a0 Is it acceptable to take bribes to place an order with another \ncompany?\n\u25a0 Should a bank invest in a company that manufactures \nweapons or tests new chemicals on animals?\n\u25a0 Is it acceptable to feed genetically modified food to cattle?\n\u25a0 Do we accept lower profits in the short term by purchasing \nless polluting production equipment?\n\u25a0 Should chief executives receive substantial pay rises and \nbonuses when other workers in the business are being \nmade redundant?\n\u25a0 Is it acceptable to close a factory to save costs and increase \nprofits even though many jobs will be lost and workers may \nfind it hard to get other jobs?\n\u25a0 If legal controls and inspections are weak in a country, is it \nacceptable to pay very low wages for long hours of work \u00a0\u2013 as \nthis policy will reduce the firm\u2019s costs?\n\u25a0 If a business can get away with it, should it employ child \nlabour to reduce costs compared to employing adults?

Biological molecules are often organic compounds. Organic compounds all contain carbon atoms. They also contain atoms of  hydrogen, oxygen and, less frequently, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus. Most of  the material in your body that is not water consists of  these organic molecules. An understanding of  why organic molecules are special will help you to understand the chemistry of  biological molecules including carbohydrates, lipids and proteins.\nEach carbon atom can make four bonds and so it can connect \nto four other atoms. Carbon atoms bond particularly strongly to other carbon atoms to make long chains. The four bonds of  a carbon atom usually form a tetrahedral shape. This means carbon compounds can be rings, branched chains or any number of  three-dimensional (3D) shapes (see fig A). In some carbon compounds small molecules (monomers) bond with many other similar units to make a very large molecule called a polymer. The ability of  carbon to combine and make macromolecules (large molecules) is the basis of  all biological molecules and provides the great variety and complexity found in living things.\nThese two bonds\nare in the plane\nof the paper.\nor more often as:C This bond goesback behind the\nplane of the paper.\nThis bond sticks out ofthe plane of the paper.\ncan be shown with corners representing carbons, and itshydrogens ignored:\nH\nCC\nHHCC\nHH\nHH\nHHC\nHC\nHHCC\nC\nHHC\nHHHH HH\nThis part \nof a chain molecule:\n\u25b2 fig A  T he bonds in a carbon atom have a complicated 3D shape.

They are also important for storing energy and they form an important part of  the cell wall in plants, fungi and bacteria. Sugars and starch are the best known carbohydrates. Sucrose is the familiar white crystalline table sugar; glucose is used as a fuel by the cells of  our bodies. Starch is in rice, flour and potatoes. But the group of  substances called carbohydrates contains many more compounds, as you will discover.\n\u25b2 fig B  Carbohydr ates are important molecules in both plants and animals \n\u2013 and carbohydrate foods like this bread play a major role in the human \ndiet.\nThe basic structure of  all carbohydrates is the same. They consist \nof  carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. There are three main groups of  carbohydrates: monosaccharides, disaccharides and \npolysaccharides. Some have more complex molecules than others (see Section 1A.3).\nMONOSACCHARIDES: THE SIMPLE SUGARS \nMonosaccharides are simple sugars in which there is one oxygen \natom and two hydrogen atoms for each carbon atom in the molecule. A general formula for this can be written (CH\n2O)n. Here \nn can be any number, but it is usually low.\nTriose sugars (n = 3) have three carbon atoms and the general \nformula C3H6O3.

This is a major problem if the heart becomes damaged, e.g. by a heart attack, or the cells became worn out through age. Recent research however, has suggested that our hearts dohave some regenerative capability.3) Some scientists now think that old or damaged cardiomyocytes can be replaced by new cardiomyocytes derived from a small supply of unipotent stem cells in the heart.4) Some researchers think that this process could be constantly occurring,but haven't yet agreed on how quickly it happens.\u2022 Some believe that it's a really slow process and that it's possible that somecardiomyocytes are never replaced throughout a person's entire lifetime.\u2022 Others think that it's occurring more quickly, so that everycardiomyocyte in the heart is replaced several times in a lifetime.Stem Cells Can be Used to Treat Human DisordersSince stem cells can divide into a range of specialised cell types, doctors and scientists think they could be used to replace cells damaged by illness or injury.Some Stem Cell Therapies Already Exist1) Some stem cell therapies already exist for some diseases affecting the blood and immune system.2) Bone marrow contains stem cells that can bccomc specialised to form any type of blood cell. Bone marrow transplants can be used to rcplace the faulty bone marrow in patients that produce abnormal blood cells. The stem cells in the transplanted bone marrow divide and specialise to produce healthy blood cells.3) This technique has been used successfully to treat leukaemia (a cancer of the blood or bone marrow) and lymphoma (a cancer of the lymphatic system).4) It has also been used to treat some genetic disorders, such as sickle-cell anaemia and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID):Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a genetic disorder that affects the immune system. People with SCID have a poorly functioning immune system as their white blood cells (made in the bone marrow from stem cells) are defective. This means they can't defend the body against infections by identifying and destroying microorganisms. So SCID sufferers are extremely susceptible to infections. Treatment with a bone marrow transplant replaces the faulty bone marrow with donor bone marrow that contains stem cells without the faulty genes that cause SCID. These then differentiate to produce functional white blood cells. These cells can identify and destroy invading pathogens, so the immune system functions properly.Stem Cells Could be Used to Treat Other DiseasesScientists are researching the use of stem cells as treatment for lots of conditions, including:\u2022 Spinal cord injuries \u2014 stem cells could be used to replace damaged nerve tissue. n n t,,,, f n \\\\i1'\u2022 Heart disease and damage caused by heart attacks \u2014 ~ These tr\u20acatmentsbwt -stem cells could be used to replace damaged heart tissue. \u201c aren't z\u2022 Bladder conditions \u2014 stem cells could be used to grow whole bladders, ^ ^^dimcal trials.

Th e central purpose of this whole unit, \u2018Business and \nits environment\u2019, is to introduce the inter-relationships \nbetween businesses, the world in which they operate and the \nlimits that governments impose on business activity. Th i s  \nfi rst chapter explains the nature of business activity and the \nrole of enterprise in setting up and developing businesses.\nThe purpose of business activity\nA business is any organisation that uses resources to \nmeet the needs of customers by providing a product or \nservice that they demand. Th ere are several stages in the \nproduction of fi nished goods. Business activity at all stages \ninvolves creating and adding value to resources, such \nas raw materials and semi- fi nished goods, and making \nthem more desirable to \u00a0\u2013 and thus valued by \u00a0\u2013 the fi nal \npurchaser. Without business activity, we would all still be \nentirely dependent on the goods that we could make or \ngrow ourselves \u00a0\u2013 as some people in virtually undiscovered \nnative communities still are. Business activity uses the \nscarce resources of our planet to produce goods and \nservices that allow us all to enjoy a very much higher \nstandard of living than would be possible if we remained \nentirely self-su ffi  cient.On completing this chapter, you will be able to:\n\u25a0 understand what business activity involves\n\u25a0 recognise that making choices as a result of the \n\u2018economic problem\u2019 always results in opportunity cost\n\u25a0 analyse the meaning and importance of creating value\n\u25a0 recognise the key characteristics of successful \nentrepreneurs\u25a0 assess the importance of enterprise and entrepreneurs \nto a country\u2019s economy\n\u25a0 understand the meaning of social enterprise and the \ndiff erence between this and other businesses.\n3","87":"1 Cell biology\n10Animal and plant cells\n\u25cf\u25cfGeneralised animal cells\nPlant and animal cells are eukaryotic. They can be unicellular or belong \nto multicellular organisms. Eukaryotic cells almost always have a \nnucleus and are generally larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells.\nThe structure of a generalised animal cell is shown in Figure 1.6. \nA generalised cell is one that has been simplified to make the key \ncomponents easier to identify.\n\u25b2 Figure 1.6 A generalised animal cell as seen with a microscope (magnified \u00d74800) \nand as three- and two-dimensional diagrams.\nComponents of animal cells\nIn the previous section we looked at bacterial cells. Animal cells have \nmany components in common with these. The cytoplasm of animal cells \nis also mainly water and it holds other components such as ribosomes. \nIn the cytoplasm most of the chemical reactions in the cell happen \n(such as the making of proteins in ribosomes).\nThe cell-surface membrane of animal cells also surrounds the cell. There \nare no cell walls in animal cells and so the membrane is on the outside \nof these cells. The membrane controls what substances go in and out of \nthe cell. Many cells need glucose and oxygen for respiration, and these \nsubstances move by diffusion into the cell from the blood, where it is \nfound at a higher concentration. Carbon dioxide moves back into the \nblood capillaries through the membrane.\nMitochondria are small organelles found in the cytoplasm and are \nonly present in eukaryotic cells. They are the site of most of a cell\u2019s \nrespiration. Here the energy stored in glucose is released for the cell \nto complete the seven life processes. Without this energy all cells die. \nMore-active cells such as those in muscles or sperm cells usually have \nmore mitochondria because these cells need more energy. Mitochondria \nhave many folds inside them, which make their surface area very large \nto increase the rate at which energy is released.\nRibosomes are the site of protein synthesis. These organelles are \npresent in the cytoplasm of animal cells.\nKEy TERM\nDiffusion  The net movement \nof particles from an area of high \nconcentration to an area of lower concentration.\nnucleuscell surface\nmembrane\ncytoplasmmitochondria\nribosomes\n","88":"1 Cell biology\n16\u25cf\u25cfCell differentiation\nThe previous two sections have looked at generalised and specialised \nanimal and plant cells. After generalised cells are formed they become \nspecialised as an organism develops. This process is called cell \ndifferentiation. Your cells did this while you were in your mother\u2019s \nuterus. Part of this process involves cells developing specific structures \nwithin them to allow them to function. For example, muscle cells need \nto release lots of energy during respiration and so require a high number \nof mitochondria. Unlike animal cells, most plant cells retain the ability \nto differentiate throughout their life. We would not be able to take plant \ncuttings without this. You will learn about this in Chapter 14.\nMicroscopy\nIt is not very easy to know who invented the first microscope or exactly when this happened.

You need to know the structure of the lungs as well as how they're ventilated... take a deep breath...Lungs are Specialised Organs for Gas ExchangeHumans need to get oxygen into the blood (for respiration) and they need to get rid of carbon dioxide (made by respiring cells). This is where breathing (or ventilation as it's sometimes called) and the gas exchange system comes in.Human Gas Exchange Systemintercostal muscles bronchusbronchiole alveoli1) As you breathe in, air enters the trachea (windpipe).2) The trachea splits into two bronchi \u2014 one bronchus leading to each lung.3) Each bronchus then branches off into smaller tubes called bronchioles.4) The bronchioles end in small 'air sacs' called alveoli (this is where gases are exchanged \u2014 see next page).5) The ribcage, intercostal muscles and diaphragm all work together to move air in and out (see below).si 111 n 111 u i w 111 m i \\ \/111 u ii i u 111111111 11111 m i 11 w n 111111\/ ~ There are actually three layers of intercostal muscles.

To do this, you need to evaluate the data used to support the claim and the methodology behind it.New Knowledge About Vaccines and Antibodies is Validated by ScientistsWhen a study presents evidence for a new theory (e.g. a vaccine has a dangerous side effect) it's important that other scientists come up with more evidence to validate (confirm) the theory. Other scientists may repeat the study and try to reproduce the results, or conduct other studies to try to prove the same theory.EXAMPLE 1: The MMR Vaccine1) In 1998, a study was published about the safety of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.The study was based on 12 children with autism (a life-long developmental disability) and concluded that there may be a link between the MMR vaccine and autism.2) Not everyone was convinced by this study because it had a very small sample size of 12 children, which increased the likelihood of the results being due to chance. The study may have been biased because one of the scientists was helping to gain evidence for a lawsuit against the MMR vaccine manufacturer. Also, studies carried out by different scientists found no link between autism and the MMR vaccine.3) There have been further scientific studies to sort out the conflicting evidence. In 2005, a Japanese study was published about the incidence of autism in Yokohama (an area of Japan). They looked at the medical records of 30 000 children born between 1988 and 1996 and counted the number of children that developed autism before the age of seven. The MMR jab was first introduced in Japan in 1989 andwas stopped in 1993. During this time the MMR vaccine was administered to children at 12 months old. The graph shows the results of the study.4) In the exam you could be asked to evaluate evidence like this.\u2022 You might be asked to describe the data...The graph shows that the number of children diagnosed with autism continued to rise after the MMR vaccine was stopped. For example, from all the children born in 1992, who did receive the MMR jab, about 60 out of 10 000 were diagnosed with autism before the age of seven. However, from all the children born in 1994, who did not receive the MMR jab, about 160 out of 10 000 of them were diagnosed with autism before the age of seven.\u2022 ...or draw conclusions There is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\u2022 ... or evaluate the methodology You can be much more confident in this study, compared to the 1998 study, because the sample size was so large \u2014 30 000 children were studied. A larger sample size means that the results are less likely to be due to chance.EXAMPLE 2: Herceptin\u00ae\u2014 Monoclonal AntibodiesAbout 20% of women with breast cancer have tumours that produce more than the usual amount of a receptor called HER2. Herceptin1 is a drug used to treat this type of breast cancer \u2014 it contains monoclonal antibodies that bind the HER2 receptor on a tumour cell and prevent the cells from growing and dividing.In 2005, a study tested Herceptin\u00ae on women who had already undergone chemotherapy for HER2-type breast cancer. 1694 women took the drug for a year after chemotherapy and another 1694 women were observed for the same time (the control group).

This is made up of  a series of  vessels with the heart as a pump to move blood through the vessels. The blood is the transport medium and its passage through the vessels is called the circulation. The system delivers the materials needed by the cells of  the body, and carries away the waste products of  their metabolism. Substances move between the plasma or red blood cells and the body cells by diffusion or by active transport (see Section 2A.4). The tiniest blood vessels have walls only one cell thick, so diffusion distances are short and substances pass easily across these into other cells. Every cell in the body is near one of  these small vessels. The blood also carries out other functions, such as carrying hormones (chemical messages) from one part of  the body to another, forming part of  the defence system of  the body and distributing heat.\nTHE COMPONENTS OF THE BLOOD AND THEIR \nMAIN FUNCTIONS\nY ou are going to study all three parts of  the cardiovascular \nsystem, starting with the transport medium \u2013 the blood.

It also acts as a buffer to regulate pH changes.\nERYTHROCYTES (RED BLOOD CELLS)\nThere are approximately 5 million erythrocytes per mm3 of  blood \n(4\u20135 million per mm3 in women, 5\u20136\u00a0million per mm3 in men). \nThey contain haemoglobin, a red pigment that carries oxygen and gives them their colour (see Section 1A.5). They are made in the bone marrow. Mature erythrocytes do not contain a nucleus and have a limited life of  about 120 days.\nThe erythrocytes transport oxygen from the lungs to all the cells. \nThey are well adapted for their function. The biconcave disc shape of  the cells means that they have a large surface area to volume ratio, so oxygen can diffuse into and out of  them rapidly (see fig B). Having no nucleus leaves much more space inside the cells for the haemoglobin molecules that carry the oxygen. In fact, each red blood cell contains around 250\u2013300\u00a0million molecules of  haemoglobin and can carry approximately 1000\u00a0million molecules of  oxygen. Haemoglobin also carries some of  the carbon dioxide produced in respiration back to the lungs. The rest is transported in the plasma.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Ahh...ATP is the Immediate Source of Energy in a Cell1) Plant and animal cells release energy from glucose \u2014 this process is called respiration.2) A cell can't get its energy directly from glucose.3) So, in respiration, the energy released from glucose is used to make ATP (adenosine triphosphate).4) ATP is made from the nucleotide base adenine, combined with a ribose sugar and three phosphate groups. It's what's known as a nucleotide derivative because it's a modified form of a nucleotide:\n5) Once made, ATP diffuses to the part of the cell that needs energy.6) The energy in ATP is stored in high energy bonds between the phosphate groups. It's released via hydrolysis reactions (see below).ATP is Quickly Made and Used1) When energy is needed by a cell, ATP is broken down into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and P; (inorganic phosphate).2) This is a hydrolysis reaction. A phosphate bond is broken and energy is released.The reaction is catalysed by the enzyme ATP hydrolase.3) ATP hydrolysis can be 'coupled' to other energy-requiring reactions in the cell \u2014 this means the energy released can be used directly to make the coupled reaction happen, rather than being lost as heat.4) The released inorganic phosphate can also be put to use \u2014 it can be added to another compound (this is known as phosphorylation), which often makes the compound more reactive.5) ATP can be re-synthesised in a condensation reaction between ADP and Pr This happens during both respiration and photosynthesis, and is catalysed by the enzyme ATP synthase.________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\u00a9\"'11111 \/1, iADP + P;adenosine diphosphate i.e. it has 2 phosphatesPhosphate groupsCONDENSATION(ENERGY USED)ATP--ATP synthaseadenosine triphosphate i.e. it has 3 phosphatesPhosphate groups\u00a9O\u00a91inorganicphosphateHYDROLYSIS (ENERGY RELEASED)\u00a9' 1 1 1 I 1 I I M 1 I I I I II \\,y- Inorganic phosphate 'r (P) is just the- fancy name for a r- single phosphate. ^\/ 1 1 I I I M I I I I I I | | I ITopic 1B \u2014 More Biological Molecules\n''Hi i n'-\n","94":"33 1B.2 THE ROLES OF THE BLOOD MAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS\nIn the lungs, the carbon dioxide concentration is low, so carbonic anhydrase catalyses the reverse \nreaction and free carbon dioxide diffuses out of  the blood and into the lungs (see fig D).\nCarbon dioxide passes into the plasma and re d\nblood cells by diffusion.

When the proportion of  carbon dioxide in the tissues is high, the affinity of  haemoglobin for oxygen is reduced. In other words, haemoglobin needs higher levels of  oxygen to become saturated and releases oxygen much more easily. So in active tissues with high carbon dioxide levels, haemoglobin releases oxygen more readily. Carbon dioxide levels in the lung capillaries are relatively low, which makes it easier for oxygen to bind to the haemoglobin. The changes in the oxygen dissociation curve that result as the carbon dioxide level changes are known as the Bohr effect. \nSaturation with oxygen\/%\n0\n0 2 4 6\nPartial pressure of oxygen\/kPaA 5 2.7  kPa  CO2\nB 5 6.7  kPa  CO2\nC 5 10.6  kPa  CO2\n8 10 12102030405060708090100\nA\nB\nC\n\u25b2 fig E  As the pr oportion of carbon dioxide in the environment rises, the haemoglobin curve moves down and to \nthe right, so it gives up oxygen more easily.

Oxygenated blood from the mother flows through the placenta close to the deoxygenated fetal blood. If  the blood of  the fetus had the same affinity for oxygen as the blood of  the mother, very little oxygen would be transferred. Fortunately, the blood of  the fetus contains a special form of  the oxygen-carrying pigment called fetal haemoglobin. Fetal haemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than the adult haemoglobin of  the mother. Consequently, the fetal haemoglobin can remove oxygen from the maternal blood even when the proportion of  oxygen is relatively low (see fig F). The maternal and fetal blood also run in LEARNING TIP\nRemember that as CO2 builds \nup it affects the pH and this has \nan effect on the protein structure, so haemoglobin does not work as well (i.e. it has a lower affinity for oxygen).\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Variation within a species means that individuals in a populationx\\' ' 1 i i i r h i i i i i i i | , ,- Variation within a C r species is also called 5- intraspecific variation -can show a wide range of different phenotypes.Although individuals of the same species have the same genes, they have different alleles (versions of genes) \u2014 this causes genetic variation within a species.The main source of this genetic variation is mutation, e.g. when changes in the DNA base sequence lead to the production of new alleles \u2014 see page 180. But genetic variation is also introduced during meiosis (through the crossing over of chromatids and the independent segregation of chromosomes) and because of the random fertilisation of gametes during sexual reproduction.Variation within a species can also be caused by differences in the environment, e.g. climate, food, lifestyle.Most variation within a species is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.But only genetic variation results in evolution.Evolution is a Change in Allele Frequencies Over TimeThe frequency of an allele in a population changes over time \u2014 this is evolution.Natural selection is one method by which evolution occurs.

Individuals with a phenotype that increases their chance of survival are more likely to survive, reproduce and pass on their genes (including the beneficial alleles that determine their phenotype), than individuals with a different phenotype.This means that a greater proportion of the next generation inherit the beneficial alleles. They, in turn, are more likely to survive, reproduce and pass on their genes.So the frequency of the beneficial alleles in the gene pool increases from generation to generation.\"i\"i n11! m i\/\/,- A selection pressure -r is anything that r- affects an organisms -- chance of survival Z- and reproduction -'<111 n \" 11 n n 1111Different Types of Natural Selection Lead to Different Frequency PatternsStabilising selection and directional selection are types of natural selection that affect allele frequency in different ways.

It occurs when the environment isn't changing, and it reduces the range of possible phenotypes.Example: In any mammal population there's a range of fur length. In a stable climate, having fur at the extremes of this range reduces the chances of surviving as it's harder to maintain the right body temperature. Animals with alleles for average fur length are the most likely to survive, reproduce and pass on their alleles. So these alleles increase in frequency.

It can also remove the preferred habitat or food source of the insect pests, helping to further reduce their numbers and simplify the food web.2) Biological agents also reduce the numbers of pests, so crops lose less energy and biomass, increasing the efficiency of energy transfer to humans.\u2022 Parasites live in or lay their eggs on a pest insect. Parasites either kill the insect or reduce its ability to function, e.g. some wasp species lay their eggs inside caterpillars \u2014 the eggs hatch and kill the caterpillars.\u2022 Pathogenic (disease-causing) bacteria and viruses are used to kill pests,O'\"\" M,m ii win mm iin\/n\/,, r Natural predators can also be r- introduced to the ecosystem to eat *- r the pest species, e.g. ladybirds eat ~- aphids this is useful but doesn't \u2014- really simplify the food web H\/( 1 1 1 1 I I M II II II (I I | I 1 | | | | , ,, ;e.g. the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produces a toxin that kills a wide range of caterpillars.3) Farmers can use integrated systems that combine both chemical and biological methods.The combined effect of using both can reduce pest numbers even more than either method alone, meaning NPP is increased even more.Topic 5B \u2014 Energy Transfer and Nutrient Cycles\n","98":"2Topic IA \u2014 Biological MoleculesCarbohydratesEven though there is, and has been, a huge variety of different organisms on Earth, they all share some biochemistry\u2014 for example, they all contain a few carbon-based compounds that interact in similar ways.Most Carbohydrates are Polymers1) Most carbohydrates (as well as proteins and nucleic acids) are polymers.2) Polymers are large, complex molecules composed of long chains of '=4monomers joined together.3) Monomers are small, basic molecular units.4) Examples of monomers include monosaccharides, amino acids and nucleotides.monomer e.g. monosaccharide, amino acidhrpolymer e.g. carbohydrate, proteinCarbohydrates are Made from Monosaccharides1) All carbohydrates contain the elements C, H and O.2) The monomers that they're made from are monosaccharides, e.g. glucose, fructose and galactose.1) Glucose is a hexose sugar \u2014 a monosaccharide with six carbon atoms in each molecule.2) There are two types of glucose, alpha (a) and beta (|3)\u2014 they're isomers (molecules with the same molecular formula as each other, but with the atoms connected in a different way).3) You need to know the structures of both types of glucose for your exam\u2014 it's pretty easy because there's only one difference between the two:a-glucose moleculeP-glucose moleculeCH,OH i 2H\\\/ h  \\  r \\Hn\/  \\ ?

Air pollution, noise \npollution and the dumping of waste products are all side \neff ects of most manufacturing processes. Who pays the \ncosts of cleaning up a ft er the production of chemicals \nor plastics, for example? Unless the business is forced \nto pay, the costs will be borne by the rest of society; the \ngovernment or local authority will have to raise taxes \nto clean the buildings dirtied by smoke, pay for medical \nprovision for those a ff ected by air pollution and make \nprovision for waste disposal.\nExternal costs: costs of an economic activity that are not \npaid for by the producer or consumer, but by the rest of \nsociety.\nKEY TERM\nIn this example, the market has failed to re fl ect the true \nand total cost of production in the price of the product.

In this case there is \nunder-provision of training and this again is a form of \nmarket failure.\nMarket failure 3: Monopoly producers\nWhen a market is dominated by one fi rm, a monopoly is \nsaid to exist. Th e business will be interested in making \nprofi ts as high as possible. Th e easiest way of achieving \nthis will be to restrict output and raise prices. As the \nmonopolist is able to prevent competitors from \u00a0entering \nthe market, this strategy will lead to under-provision of goods and services compared with what consumers \nwould really like. Th is is, therefore, a form of \nmarket \u00a0failure.\nCorrecting or controlling market failure\nTable 9.7 takes the three examples of market failure we \nhave considered a nd looks at the groups most a ff ected and \nthe corrective action that could be taken.\nIncome elasticity of demand\nVirtually all businesses will have greater opportunities \nfor increased sales, pro fi ts and expansion during periods \nof economic growth.

Plants store excess glucose as starch (when a plant needs more glucose for energy, it breaks down starch to release the glucose).2) Starch is a mixture of two polysaccharides of alpha-glucose \u2014 amylose and amylopectin:\u2022 Amylose \u2014 a long, unbranched chain of a-glucose. The angles of the glycosidic bonds give it a coiled structure, almost like a cylinder. This makes it compact, so it's really good for storage because you can fit more in to a small space.\u2022 Amylopectin \u2014 a long, branched chain of a-glucose. Its side branches allow the enzymes that break down the molecule to get at the glycosidic bonds easily.This means that the glucose can be released quickly. Amylopectin3) Starch is insoluble in water and doesn't affect water potential (see page 40), so it doesn't cause water to enter cells by osmosis, which would make them swell.This makes it good for storage.Use the Iodine Test for StarchIf you do any experiment on the digestion of starch and want to find out if any is left, you'll need the iodine test.just add iodine dissolved in potassium iodide solution to the test sample. If there is starch present, the sample changes from browny-orange to a dark, blue-black colour.Glycogen is the Main Energy Storage Material in AnimalsGlycogen1) Animal cells get energy from glucose too.But animals store excess glucose as glycogen\u2014 another polysaccharide of alpha-glucose.2) Its structure is very similar to amylopectin, except that it has loads more side branches coming off it. Loads of branches means that stored glucose can be released quickly, which is important for energy release in animals.3) It's also a very compact molecule, so it's good for storage.After throwing and fetching the ball no less than 312 times, Chappy and Stuart were finally out of glycogen.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","105":"28Prokaryotic Cells and VirusesNow we're on to prokaryotic cells and viruses.

Yeah right.Plants Photosynthesise and Produce Biomass1) An ecosystem includes all the organisms living in a particular area and all the non-living (abiotic) conditions (see p. 170).2) In all ecosystems, there are producers \u2014 organisms that make their own food, e.g. plants and algae produce their own food through photosynthesis.3) During photosynthesis plants use energy (from sunlight) and carbon dioxide (from the atmosphere in land-based ecosystems, or dissolved in water in aquatic ecosystems) to make glucose and other sugars (see pages 106-109).4) Some of the sugars produced during photosynthesis are used in respiration, to release energy for growth.5) The rest of the glucose is used to make other biological molecules, such as cellulose (a component of plant cell walls). These biological molecules make up the plant's biomass \u2014 the mass of living material.6) Biomass can also be thought of as the chemical energy stored in the plant.7) Energy is transferred through the living organisms of an ecosystem when organisms eat other organisms, e.g. producers are eaten by organisms called primary consumers. Primary consumers are then eaten by secondary consumers and secondary consumers are eaten by tertiary consumers. This is a food chain (see p. 122).Biomass can be Measured as Dry Mass or Using a CalorimeterBiomass can be measured in terms of the mass of carbon that an organism The water content of'livin' 'tissue' v' W''' contains or the dry mass of its tissue per unit area. \u00a3 so cry mass is used as a melsu^oT z1) Dry mass is the mass of the organism with the water removed. ''n\\ i imTm mnl um'm mm2) To measure the dry mass, a sample of the organism is dried, often in an oven set to a low temperature.The sample is then weighed at regular intervals (e.g. every day). Once the mass becomes constant you know that all the water has been removed.3) If needed, the result from the sample can be scaled up to give the dry mass (biomass) of the totalpopulation or the area being investigated. A typical unit for dry mass might be kg nr2.4) The mass of carbon present is generally taken to be 50% of the dry mass.You can estimate the amount of chemical energy stored in biomass by burning the biomass in a calorimeter.The amount of heat given off tells you how much energy is in it. Energy is measured in joules (J) or kilojoules (kj).1) A sample of dry biomass is burnt and the energy released is used to heat a known volume of water.2) The change in temperature of the water is used to calculate the chemical energy of the dry biomass.GPP and NPP are Chemical Energy Stores~ Remember plants convert -1) Gross primary production (GPP) is the total amount of chemical energy r \"9ht energy to chemical -converted from light energy by plants, in a given area. dunn9 Photosynthesis -( 1 I 1 1 \/ N | \/ \/ \/ | , | . ,2) Approximately 50% of the gross primary production is lost to the environment as heat when the plants respire. This is called respiratory loss (R).3) The remaining chemical energy is called the net primary production (NPP). So NPP = GPP - R.4) The NPP is the energy available to the plant for growth and reproduction \u2014 the energy is stored in the plant'sbiomass. It is also the energy available to organisms at the next stage in the food chain (the next trophic level, see page 122). These include herbivores (animals that eat the plants) and decomposers.5) Often primary production is expressed as a rate \u2014 i.e. the total amount of chemical energy (or biomass) in agiven area, in a given time.

There are around 4000\u201311\n \n000\u00a0per\u00a0mm3 of  blood and there are several different types. \nThey are made in the bone marrow, although some mature in the thymus gland. Their main function is to defend the body against infection. Leucocytes are also very important in the inflammatory response of  the body when an area of  tissue is damaged. They all contain a nucleus and have colourless cytoplasm, although some types contain granules which can be stained. There are several different types of  leucocyte, which you will study further in  Book 2 Chapter 6B. \nPLATELETS\nPlatelets are tiny fragments of  large cells called megakaryocytes, which are found in the bone marrow. There are about 150\n 000\u2013400\n 000 pla\ntelets per mm3 of  blood. They are \ninvolved in blood clotting (see page 35).\nTRANSPORT OF OXYGEN\nThe many haemoglobin molecules that are in the red blood cells transport oxygen. Each haemoglobin molecule is a large globular protein consisting of  four peptide chains, each with an iron-containing prosthetic group. Each group can collect four molecules of  oxygen in a reversible process to form oxyhaemoglobin:\n   Hb + 4O2 \u21cb Hb.4O2   ____________________________________     haemoglobin + oxygen \u21cb oxyhaemoglobin     \nT\nhe first oxygen molecule that binds to the haemoglobin changes \nthe arrangement of  the molecule making it easier for the following oxygen molecules to bind. The final oxygen molecule binds several hundred times faster than the first. The same process happens in reverse when oxygen dissociates from haemoglobin \u2013 it gets progressively harder to remove the oxygen.\nEXAM HINT\nAlways use suitable scientific terms. This is important because it can \nhelp to focus a response clearly.\nWhen the blood enters the lungs, the concentration of  oxygen \nin the red blood cells is relatively low. Oxygen moves into the red blood cells from the air in the lungs by diffusion. The oxygen is collected and bound to the haemoglobin, so the free oxygen concentration in the cytoplasm of  the red blood cells stays low. This maintains a steep concentration gradient from the air in the lungs to the red blood cells, so more and more oxygen diffuses in and joins onto the haemoglobin.The oxygen levels are relatively low in the body tissues. The concentration of  oxygen in the cytoplasm of  the red blood cells is higher than in the surrounding tissue. As a result, oxygen moves out into the body cells by diffusion down its concentration gradient. The haemoglobin molecules give up some of  their oxygen. When you are at rest or exercising gently, only about 25% of  the oxygen carried by the haemoglobin is released into your cells. There is another 75% in reserve in the transport system for when you are very active.\nThe strong affinity of  haemoglobin for oxygen means that a \nsmall change in the proportion of  oxygen in the surrounding environment can have a big effect on the saturation of  the blood with oxygen. So in the lungs, the haemoglobin rapidly gains oxygen and in the tissues, as the oxygen saturation of  the environment falls, oxygen is released rapidly (see fig C).\n0100\n50\nPartial pressure of oxygenAs deoxygenated blood approaches the lungs, the steep part of the curv e\nmeans that a small increase in partial pr essure  causes a large increase in\n% saturation.\nAs oxygenated blood approaches the tissues, a small decre ase in\npartial pressure causes a large decrease in % saturation (i.e. a large\nrelease of oxygen).Percentage saturation of \nhaemoglobin with oxygenhigh partial\npressureof oxygen \u2013the conditionsin the lungs\nthe \u2018predicted\u2019 straight linethe actual sigmoid curve\nlow partial pressure ofoxygen \u2013 the conditionsin the respiring tissues\n\u25b2 fig C  Oxy gen dissociation curve for human haemoglobin\nTRANSPORT OF CARBON DIOXIDE\nWaste carbon dioxide diffuses from the respiring cells of  the \nbody tissues into the blood along a concentration gradient. The reaction of  the carbon dioxide with water is crucial. When carbon dioxide is dissolved in the blood it reacts slowly with the water to form carbonic acid, H\n2CO3. The carbonic acid separates to form \nhydrogen ions H+ and hydrogencarbonate ions HCO3\u2013:\nCO2 + H2O \u21cb H2CO3 \u21cb HCO3\u2013 + H+\nAbout 5% of  the carbon dioxide is carried in solution in the plasma. A further 10\u201320% combines with haemoglobin molecules to make carbaminohaemoglobin. Most of  the carbon dioxide is transported in the cytoplasm of  the red blood cells as hydrogencarbonate ions. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase controls the rate of  the reaction between carbon dioxide and water to produce carbonic acid.\nIn the body tissues, there is a high concentration of  carbon dioxide \nin the blood, so carbonic anhydrase catalyses the formation of  carbonic acid.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

The chromatids still contain the same genes but now have a different combination of alleles.Chromatids of one chromosomeCrossing over occurs between chromatidsChromatids now have a new combination of allelesMeiosis Produces Cells that are Genetically DifferentThere are two main events during meiosis that lead to genetic variation:(l^Crossing over of chromatidsThe crossing over of chromatids in meiosis I means that each of the four daughter cells formed from meiosis contains chromatids with different alleles:The chromosomes of homologous pairs come together.MEIOSIS IChromatids cross over.\nMEIOSISOne chromosome from each homologous pair ends up in each cell.Each cell has a different chromatid and therefore a different set of alleles, which increases genetic variation.(2) Independent segregation of chromosomer1) Each homologous pair of chromosomes in your cells is made up of one chromosome from your mum (maternal) and one chromosome from your dad (paternal).2) When the homologous pairs are separated in meiosis I, it's completely random which chromosome from each pair ends up in which daughter cell.3) So the four daughter cells produced by meiosis have completely different combinations of those maternal and paternal chromosomes.4) This is called independent segregation (separation) of the chromosomes.5) This 'shuffling' of chromosomes leads to genetic variation in any potential offspring.MEIOSISPaternalMaternalORPossible combinations in daughter cellsMeiosis Has a Different Outcome to MitosisYou may remember mitosis from page 32. Mitosis and meiosis have different outcomes:Outcomes:MitosisProduces cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell.Daughter cells are genetically identical to each other and to the parent cell.Produces two daughter cells.MeiosisProduces cells with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.Daughter cells are genetically different from one another and the parent cell.Produces four daughter cells.You need to be able to explain the different outcomes of mitosis and meiosis. They're different because mitosis only involves one division (which separates the sister chromatids) whereas meiosis has two divisions (which separate the homologous pairs and then the sister chromatids). There's no pairing or separating of homologous chromosomes in mitosis, and so no crossing over or independent segregation of chromosomes. This produces genetically identical daughter cells \u2014 unlike meiosis.Topic 4B \u2014 Diversity, Classification and Variation\n","109":"80Transport in Plants \u2014 PhloemNext up, it's time to look at phloem. I know,; I almost can't contain my excitement. When it comes to the phloem it's all about moving dissolved organic substances around the plant, so it's a bit different to xylem.Phloem Tissue is Adapted for Transporting Solutes1) Solutes are dissolved substances. Phloem tissue transports solutes (mainly sugars like sucrose) round plants. Like xylem, phloem is formed from cells arranged in tubes.2) Sieve tube elements and companion cells are important cell types in phloem tissue:\u2022 Sieve tube elements are living cells that form the tube for transporting solutes. They have no nucleus and few organelles, so...\u2022 ...there's a companion cell for each sieve tube element. They carry out living functions for sieve cells, e.g. providing the energy needed for the active transport of solutes.Translocation is the Movement of Solutes1) Translocation is the movement of solutes (e.g. sugars like sucrose, and amino acids) to where they're needed in a plant. Solutes are sometimes called assimilates.2) It's an energy-requiring process that happens in the phloem.3) Translocation moves solutes from 'sources' to 'sinks'. The source of a solute is where it's made (so it's at a high concentration there). The sink is the area where it's used up (so it's at a lower concentration there).E.g. the source for sucrose is usually the leaves (where it's made), and the sinks are the other parts of the plant, especially the food storage organs and the meristems {areas of growth) in the roots, stems and leaves.4) Enzymes maintain a concentration gradient from the source to the sink by changing the solutes at the sink (e.g. by breaking them down or making them into something else). This makes sure there's always a lower concentration at the sink than at the source.E.g. in potatoes, sucrose is converted to starch in the sink areas, so there's always a lower concentration of sucrose at the sink than inside the phloem. This makes sure a constant supply of new sucrose reaches the sink from the phloem.The Mass Flow Hypothesis Best Explains Phloem TransportScientists still aren't certain exactly how the solutes are transported from source to sink by translocation. The best supported theory is the mass flow hypothesis:1) Active transport (see p. 42) is used to actively load the solutes (e.g. sucrose from photosynthesis) from companion cells into the sieve tubes of the phloem at the source (e.g. the leaves).2) This lowers the water potential inside the sieve tubes, so water enters the tubes by osmosis from the xylem and companion cells.3) This creates a high pressure inside the sieve tubes at the source end of the phloem.1) At the sink end, solutes are removed from the phloem to be used up.2) This increases the water potential inside the sieve tubes, so water also leaves the tubes by osmosis.3) This lowers the pressure inside the sieve tubes.(j) SOURCElow water potential, high pressurewater flow solute flow\u00a9sieve plate plasmodesma\u2014Water flows to xylem(2) SINK high water potential,\u00ae1) The result is a pressure gradient from the source end to the sink end.

These also lower your risk of  developing atherosclerosis and CVDs. A study of  10\n 269 male Har\nvard University (USA) graduates aged between \n45 and 84 showed that the men who changed from being inactive to taking regular exercise had a 23% lower mortality over the life of  the study than those who did not exercise. Moreover, the main cause of  the deaths was atherosclerosis and the linked CVDs. A study of  72\n 488 f\nemale nurses \nshowed the same benefits for women \u2013 the more active women had a significantly lower risk of  developing atherosclerosis and other CVDs. \nA 2013 study from Sri Lanka showed a similar pattern \u2013 high levels of  inactivity were linked to an \nincreased risk of  obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and CVDs. High levels of  activity were linked to a reduced risk of  all these conditions. Several studies have shown that exercise both reduces the formation of  plaques in the arteries and also keeps plaques that are present more stable and less likely to break.\nHIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nAs you saw in Section 1B.4, the heart pumps blood out into your arteries in a regular rhythm. The blood travels through your arterial system at pressures which change as your heart beats and which are easily measured (see fig C). At systole, when the blood is forced out of  the heart, a healthy blood pressure is around 120\n mmHg\n. When the heart is relaxed and filling during diastole, a healthy blood \npressure is around 80\n mmHg\n. Measuring blood pressure is used as an indicator of  the health of  both \nyour heart and your blood vessels. Y our blood pressure goes up and down naturally during the day \u2013 but it shouldn\u2019t be constantly raised. If  your blood pressure is regularly above 140\/90\n mmHg\n, you \nhave high blood pressure or hypertension. Raised blood pressure can be a sign of  atherosclerosis. The blood pressure goes up when the walls of  the arteries become less flexible due to the build-up of  plaque, and when the lumen of  the arteries get narrower as they are blocked by the plaques. This means that raised blood pressure can be the result of  atherosclerosis and can be used to help diagnose the disease.\n\u25b2 fig C  Doctors can use a blood pr essure monitor like this to check that your blood pressure is in the healthy range. \nSome people buy and use their own monitor, so they can check their blood pressure regularly to help prevent them \ngetting CVDs.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

This is called genetic engineering.2) Transformed microorganisms can be made using the same technology as in vivo cloning (see page 199). For example, foreign DNA can be inserted into microorganisms to produce lots of useful protein, e.g. insulin:jvM \/1 \" 1 I I \" , , , , , , , , I , 1 , # ( !

The plasmid is added to a bacterium and the bacterium is used as a vector to get the gene into the plant cells.If the right promoter region has been added along with the gene (see p. 199), the transformed cells will be able to produce the desired protein.Transformed animals can be produced too \u2014 a gene that codes for a desirable protein can be inserted into an early animal embryo or into the egg cells of a female. If the gene is inserted into a very early embryo, all the body cells of the resulting transformed animal will end up containing the gene. Inserting it into the egg cells means that when the female reproduces, all the cells of her offspring will contain the gene.Promoter regions that are only activated in specific cell types can be used to control exactly which of an animal's body cells the protein is produced in. If the protein is only produced in certain cells, it can be harvested more easily. Producing the protein in the wrong cells could also damage the organism.Recombinant DNA Technology Can be Used to Benefit HumansTransformed organisms (microorganisms, plants and animals) can be used in a variety of ways. You need to be able to interpret information about how they are used. Here are some examples:AgricultureAgricultural crops can be transformed so that they give higher yields or are more nutritious. This means these plants can be used to reduce the risk of famine and malnutrition. Crops can also be transformed to have pest resistance, so that fewer pesticides are needed. This reduces costs and reduces any environmental problems associated with using pesticides.For example, Golden Rice is a variety of transformed rice. It contains one gene from a maize plant and one gene from a soil bacterium, which together enable the rice to produce beta-carotene. The beta-carotene is used by our bodies to produce vitamin A. Golden Rice is being developed to reduce vitamin A deficiency in areas where there's a shortage of dietary vitamin A, e.g. south Asia, Africa. Vitamin A deficiency is a big problem in these areas, e.g. up to 500 000 children per year worldwide go blind due to vitamin A deficiency.IndustryIndustrial processes often use biological catalysts (enzymes). These enzymes can be produced from transformed organisms, so they can be produced in large quantities for less money, reducing costs.For example, chymosin (or rennin) is an enzyme used in cheese-making. It used to be made from rennet (a substance produced in the stomach of cows), but it can now be produced by transformed organisms. This means it can be made in large quantities, relatively cheaply and without killing any cows, making some cheese suitable for vegetarians.MedicineMany drugs and vaccines are produced by transformed organisms, using recombinant DNA technology. They can be made quickly, cheaply and in large quantities using this method.For example, insulin is used to treat Type 1 diabetes and used to come from animals (cow, horse or pig pancreases). This insulin wasn't human insulin though, so it didn't work quite as well. Human insulin is now made from transformed microorganisms, using a cloned human insulin gene (see above).Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n","112":"209Planning an ExperimentYou Need to Know How to Use Apparatus and Techniques CorrectlyExaminers could ask you about a whole range of different apparatus and techniques.

Don't forget that your solutions will need time to get to the same temperature as the water before you start the experiment too. Also, remember to check the temperature of the water bath with a thermometer during the investigation to make sure it doesn't change.\u2022 Data logger \u2014 Decide what you are measuring and what type of data logger you will need,e.g. temperature, pH. Connect an external sensor to the data logger if you need to. Decide how often you want the data logger to take readings depending on the length of the process that you are measuring.Make sure you know how to do all the practical investigations described in this book. You should be able to apply the techniques described to different contexts. For example, page 113 describes how to use a colorimeter and a redox indicator dye to investigate the rate of dehydrogenase activity in chloroplasts. You could use a similar technique (i.e. a colorimeter and a redox indicator dye) to investigate the rate of respiration in yeast.Risk Assessments Help You to Work Safely1) When you're planning an experiment, you need to carry out a risk assessment. To do this, you need to identify:\u2022 All the dangers in the experiment, e.g. any hazardous chemicals, microorganisms or naked flames.\u2022 Who is at risk from these dangers.\u2022 What can be done to reduce the risk, such as wearing goggles or gloves or working in a fume cupboard.2) You also need to consider any ethical issues in your experiment. For example, if you're using living animals (e.g. insects) you must treat them with respect. This means handling them carefully and keeping them away from harmful chemicals, extreme heat sources and other things that might cause them physical discomfort.Record Your Data in a Tableunits-It's a good idea to draw a table to record the results of your experiment in.1) When you draw a table, make sure you include enough rows and columns to record all of the data you need to.You might also need to include a column for processing your data (e.g. working out an average).2) Make sure each column has a heading so you know what's going to be recorded where.

It's pretty exciting stuff...Two Types of Tissue are Involved in Transport in Plants1) Xylem tissue transports water and mineral ions in solution.These substances move up the plant from the roots to the leaves.2) Phloem tissue transports organic substances like sugars (also in solution) bothup and down the plant \u2014 there's more about the phloem on pages 80-81.3) Xylem and phloem are mass transport systems (see page 54) \u2014 they move substances over large distances.Xylem vessels are the part of the xylem tissue that actually transports the water and ions.

When it's dark the stomata are usually closed, so there's little transpiration.2) Temperature \u2014 the higher the temperature the faster the transpiration rate. Warmer water molecules have more energy so they evaporate from the cells inside the leaf faster. This increases the concentration gradient between the inside and outside of the leaf, making water diffuse out of the leaf faster.3) Humidity \u2014 the lower the humidity, the faster the transpiration rate (i.e. there's a negative correlationbetween humidity and transpiration rate). If the air around the plant is dry, the concentration gradient between the leaf and the air is increased, which increases transpiration.4) Wind \u2014 the windier it is, the faster the transpiration rate.

Make it clear that both atria pump at the same time and both ventricles pump at the same time.\n1 T he inferior vena cava collects deoxygenated blood from the \nlower parts of  the body, while the superior vena cava receives \ndeoxygenated blood from the head, neck, arms and chest. Deoxygenated blood is delivered to the right atrium.\n2\n T\nhe right atrium receives the blood from the great veins. As it \nfills with blood, the pressure builds up and opens the tricuspid valve, so the right ventricle starts to fill with blood too. When the atrium is full it contracts, forcing more blood into the ventricle. The atrium has thin muscular walls because it receives blood at low pressure from the inferior vena cava and the superior vena cava and it needs to exert relatively little pressure to move the blood into the ventricle. One-way semilunar valves (like the valves in veins described in Section\u00a01B.3) at the entrance to the atrium stop a backflow of  blood into the veins.\n3\n \nThe tricuspid valve consists of  three flaps and is also \nknown as an atrioventricular valve because it separates an atrium from a ventricle. The valve allows blood to pass from the atrium to the ventricle, but not in the other direction. The tough tendinous cords, also known as valve tendons or heartstrings, make sure the valves are not turned inside out by the pressure exerted when the ventricles contract.\n4\n T\nhe right ventricle is filled with blood under some pressure \nwhen the right atrium contracts, then the ventricle contracts. Its muscular walls produce the pressure needed to force blood out of  the heart into the pulmonary arteries. These carry the deoxygenated blood to the capillaries in the lungs. As the ventricle starts to contract, the tricuspid valve closes to prevent blood flowing into the atrium. Semilunar valves, like those in veins, prevent the blood flowing back from the arteries into the ventricle.\n5\n T\nhe blood returns from the lungs to the left side of  the heart in \nthe pulmonary veins. The blood is at relatively low pressure after passing through the extensive capillaries of  the lungs. The blood returns to the left atrium, another thin-walled chamber that performs the same function as the right atrium. It contracts to force blood into the left ventricle. Backflow is prevented by another atrioventricular valve known as the bicuspid valve , which has only two flaps.\n6\n As the left a\ntrium contracts, the bicuspid valve opens and the \nleft ventricle is filled with blood under pressure. As the left ventricle starts to contract the bicuspid valve closes to prevent backflow of  blood to the left atrium. The left ventricle pumps the blood out of  the heart and into the aorta, the major artery of  the body. This carries blood away from the heart at even higher pressure than the major arteries that branch off  from it. \nThe muscular wall of  the left side of  the heart is much thicker than that of  the right. The right side pumps blood to the lungs, which are relatively close to the heart. The delicate capillaries of  the lungs need blood delivered at relatively low pressure. The left side must produce sufficient force to move the blood under pressure to all the extremities of  the body and overcome the elastic recoil of  the arteries. Semilunar valves prevent the blood flowing back from the aorta into the ventricle.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that the valves do not operate on their own. They open \nand close as blood pressure changes in the chambers on either side of the valve. When the pressure is higher on one side it will push the valve open. When it is higher on the other side, it will close the valve.\nThe septum is a thick wall of  muscle and connective tissue \nbetween the two sides of  the heart. It prevents the oxygenated blood mixing with the deoxygenated blood. \nDID YOU KNOW? \nIn an embryo, there is a gap in the septum called the foramen ovale and the blood from the two sides of the heart can mix. This does not matter because the lungs of the fetus do not function and little blood flows to them. At birth, this hole closes over as the lungs begin to function.

There are certain factors that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.Most Cardiovascular Disease Starts with Atheroma Formationelastic tissue in wall1) The wall of an artery is made up of several layers (see p. 70).2) The endothelium (inner lining) is usually smooth and unbroken.3) If damage occurs to the endothelium (e.g. by high blood pressure) white blood cells (mostly macrophages) and lipids (fat) from the blood, clump together under the lining to form fatty streaks.4) Over time, more white blood cells, lipids and connective tissue build up and harden to form a fibrous plaque called an atheroma.5) This plaque partially blocks the lumen of the artery and restricts blood flow, which causes blood pressure to increase.6) Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a type of cardiovascular disease.It occurs when the coronary arteries have lots of atheromas in them, which restricts blood flow to the heart muscle. It can lead to myocardial infarction (see below).Atheromas Increase the Risk of Aneurysm and ThrombosisTwo types of disease that affect the arteries are:Aneurysm \u2014 a balloon-like swelling of the artery.1) Atheroma plaques damage and weaken arteries.They also narrow arteries, increasing blood pressure.2) When blood travels through a weakened artery at high pressure, it may push the inner layers of the artery through the outer elastic layer to form a balloon-like swelling \u2014 an aneurysm.3) This aneurysm may burst, causing a haemorrhage (bleeding).Thrombosis \u2014 formation of a blood clot.1) An atheroma plaque can rupture (burst through) the endothelium (inner lining) of an artery.2) This damages the artery wall and leaves a rough surface.3) Platelets and fibrin (a protein) accumulate at the site of damage and form a blood clot (a thrombus).4) This blood clot can cause a complete blockage of the artery, or it can become dislodged and block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body.5) Debris from the rupture can cause another blood clot to form further down the artery.Interrupted Blood Flow to the Heart can Cause a Myocardial Infarction1) The heart muscle is supplied with blood by the coronary arteries.2) This blood contains the oxygen needed by heart muscle cells to carry out respiration.3) If a coronary artery becomes completely blocked (e.g. by a blood clot) an area of the heart muscle will be totally cut off from its blood supply, receiving no oxygen.4) This causes a myocardial infarction \u2014 more commonly known as a heart attack.5) A heart attack can cause damage and death of the heart muscle.6) Symptoms include pain in the chest and upper body, shortness of breath and sweating.7) If large areas of the heart are affected complete heart failure can occur, which is often fatal.aneurysmnormal arterythick muscle* layerdeposits of fatty material, dead cells, white blood cells and connective tissuedeposits of fatty material etc. build up and push out endothelium to form an atheromalumen(space in centre)endothelium\nlumen shrinks as artery wall swells, so it's more difficult for blood to pass through\nTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n","116":"MAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS 46 1B.5 ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nsolve a severe problem permanently.

As you have seen, the wall of  an artery affected  by a plaque is stiffened, making it much more likely to suffer cracks or damage. Platelets touch the damaged surface of  the plaque and the clotting process is triggered (see Section 1B.2). The plaque itself  may rupture and break open, and the cholesterol that is released will also cause the platelets to trigger the blood clotting process. A clot may also develop because the endothelial lining is damaged, for example by high blood pressure or smoking.\nA clot that forms in a blood vessel is known as a thrombosis.  \nThe clot can rapidly block the whole blood vessel, particularly if  it is already narrowed by a plaque. A clot that gets stuck in a coronary artery is known as a coronary thrombosis. The clot  can block the artery, starving the heart muscle beyond that point of  oxygen and nutrients, and this often leads to a heart attack  (see fig E).Blargest heart attack\n(cardiac arre st) follows\nif blockage is at C\nmedium heart attack \u2013 death \nof some heart tissue if blockage is at Bsmall heart attack \u2013 death of small amount of heart tissue if blockage is at AABC\n\u25b2 fig E  T he size and severity of a heart attack is closely related to the \nposition of the blockage in the coronary artery.\nDuring a heart attack, there is chest pain in the same areas as in \nan angina attack, but it is much more severe. The pain may occur at any time, although exercise may start it, and it often lasts for several hours. Death may occur very rapidly with no previous symptoms, or it may happen after several days of  feeling tired and suffering symptoms mistaken for indigestion.\nIt is very important to react quickly if  you suspect someone is \nhaving a heart attack. Give them two full-strength aspirin tablets to help stop the blood clotting, and get them to hospital as fast as you can.\nSTROKES\nA stroke is caused by an interruption to the normal blood supply to an area of  the brain. This may be due to bleeding from damaged capillaries or a blockage cutting off  the blood supply to the brain. A blockage is usually caused by a blood clot, an atheroma or a combination of  the two. Sometimes, the blood clot forms somewhere else in the body and is carried in the bloodstream until it gets stuck in an artery in the brain. The damage happens very quickly. A blockage in one of  the main arteries leading to the brain causes a very serious stroke that may lead to death. In one of  the smaller arterioles leading into the brain, the effects may be less disastrous.\nThe symptoms of  strokes vary, depending on how much of  the \nbrain is affected. Very often, the blood is cut off  from one part or one side of  the brain only (see fig F). Symptoms include dizziness, confusion, slurred speech, blurred vision or partial loss of  vision (usually one eye) and numbness. In more severe strokes, there can be paralysis, usually on one side of  the body.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

We need to show \nhow one thing causes another and we still don\u2019t really know how fruit and vegetables have their effect. They are very varied in their chemistry. For some time, it was thought that the antioxidants found in fruit and vegetables might be the answer. Vitamins, such as vitamin A found in carrots, vitamin C from citrus fruits and vitamin E from leafy green vegetables, almonds and sunflower oil, are antioxidants and they are found in fruits and vegetables. Several studies appeared to show that antioxidants were the answer and many people started taking antioxidant supplements to protect their hearts. However, recent studies, including some very large metadata analyses (studies where scientists have looked at the results of  many different investigations), have shown that the evidence for antioxidants being good for your heart is inconclusive. There is some evidence that some antioxidants may cause harm.\nVITAMIN C: A CASE STUDY\nVitamin C is important in the formation of  connective tissue in the body, such as in the bones, teeth, skin and many internal body surfaces including the endothelial lining of  blood vessels. A severe lack of  vitamin C in the diet causes scurvy, which can result in bleeding gums, bruising easily and painful joints. As you have seen, if  the lining of  an artery is damaged, atherosclerosis is more likely to develop. So, it makes sense, in theory, that if  your diet is low in vitamin C, your arteries are more likely to be damaged and you are more likely to be affected by CVD. \nA study published in the British Medical Journal in 1997 looked at the association between \nconcentration of  vitamin C in the blood and risk of  heart attack in 1605 men from eastern Finland. The men had no sign of  coronary artery disease when they were tested between 1984 and 1989. Their vitamin C levels were also tested.

These cells accumulate chemicals from the blood, especially cholesterol. This leads to a plaque (also known as an atheroma) forming on the endothelial lining of  the artery (see fig C). Fibrous tissue and calcium salts also build up (increase in amount) around the atheroma, turning it into a hardened plaque. This hardened area means that part of  the artery wall is less elastic and narrower than it should be. This is atherosclerosis and is summarised in fig B.\nThe plaque causes the lumen of  the artery to become much smaller. This increases the blood \npressure, making it harder for the heart to pump blood around the body. The raised blood pressure makes damage more likely in other areas of  the endothelial lining and more plaques will form.  This will make the blood pressure even higher, and so the problem gets worse. There are many factors that are linked to the development of  atherosclerosis. Y ou will look at these in more detail  in Chapter 1C.\nEFFECT OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS ON HEALTH\nAtherosclerosis can have many serious effects on the health of  an individual. The development  of  atherosclerosis can be summarised as: damage to the endothelium of  the arteries \u2192 inflammatory response \u2192 accumulation of  cholesterol \u2192 atheroma \u2192 fibrous tissue\/calcium salts \u2192 plaque \u2192 narrowing\/loss of  elasticity of  the artery.\nANEURYSMS\nIf  an area of  an artery is narrowed by plaque, blood tends to collect behind the blockage. The artery bulges and the wall is put under more pressure than usual, so it becomes weakened. This is known as an aneurysm. The weakened artery wall may split open, leading to massive internal bleeding. Aneurysms frequently happen in the blood vessels supplying the brain or in the aorta, especially when it passes through the abdomen. The massive blood loss and drop in blood pressure are often fatal, but if  aneurysms are diagnosed they can be treated by surgery before they burst.\nRAISED BLOOD PRESSURE\nThe arteries narrowed due to plaques on the walls cause raised blood pressure. This can lead to severe damage in a number of  organs, including the kidneys, the eyes and the brain. The high pressure damages the tiny blood vessels where your kidney filters out urea and other substances from the blood. If  the vessels feeding the kidney tubules become narrowed, the pressure inside them gets even higher and proteins may be forced out through their walls. If  you have high blood pressure, your doctors can test for protein in your urine as a sign of  kidney damage. \nSimilarly, the tiny blood vessels supplying the retina of  your eye are easily damaged. If  they become \nblocked or leak, the retinal cells are starved of  oxygen and die and this can cause blindness. \nBleeding from the capillaries into the brain results in one type of  stroke (see below).\nHEART DISEASE\nThere are many kinds of  heart disease, but the two most common ones are angina and myocardial \ninfarction (heart attack); both are closely linked to atherosclerosis (see figs B and D ).\nIn angina, plaques build up slowly in the coronary arteries, reducing blood flow to the parts of  the heart muscle beyond the plaques. Often symptoms are first noticed during exercise, when the cardiac muscle is working harder and needs more oxygen. The narrowed coronary arteries cannot supply enough oxygenated blood and the heart muscle resorts to anaerobic respiration. This causes a gripping pain in the chest that can extend into the arms, particularly the left one, and the jaw, and often also causes breathlessness. The symptoms of  angina subside once exercise stops, but the experience is painful and frightening.\nFortunately, most angina is relatively mild. It can be helped by taking regular exercise, losing weight \nand not smoking. The symptoms can be treated by drugs that cause rapid dilation of  the coronary blood vessels so that they supply the cardiac muscle with the oxygen it needs. However, if  the blockage of  the coronary arteries continues to get worse, so will the symptoms of  the angina. Other drugs are then used to dilate the blood vessels and reduce the heart rate. Unfortunately, drugs cannot \n\u25b2 fig C  F atty deposits like these \nin an artery cause disease and death in millions of people  every year.\nEXAM HINT\nMake sure you are clear about \nall of the different terms.

They both involve RNA.There\u2019s More Than One Type of RNARemember, RNA is a single polynucleotide strand and it contains uracil (U) as a base instead of thymine (see p. 16). Uracil always pairs with adenine during protein synthesis. RNA isn't all the same though. You need to know about:(Messenger RNA (mRNA))mRNA is made during transcription (see below). It carries the genetic code from the DNA to the ribosomes, where it's used to make a protein during translation (see next page). mRNA is a single ^ Basepolynucleotide strand.In mRNA, groups of three adjacent bases are usually called codons (they're sometimes Phosphate called triplets or base triplets). Ribose sugarvcodon(Transfer RNA (tRNA))tRNA is involved in translation. It carries the amino acids that are used to make proteins to the ribosomes. tRNA is a single polynucleotide strand that's folded into a clover shape. Hydrogen bonds between specific base pairs hold the molecule in this shape.Every tRNA molecule has a specific sequence of three bases at one end called an anticodon.They also have an amino acid binding site at the other end.AnticodonAmino acid binding siteHydrogen bonds between base pairsFirst Stage of Protein Synthesis \u2014  TranscriptionDuring transcription, an mRNA copy of a gene is made from DNA.In eukaryotic cells, transcription takes place in the nucleus.(Prokaryotes don't have a nucleus, so transcription takes place in the cytoplasm.Transcription starts when RNA polymerase (an enzyme) attaches to the DNA double-helix at the beginning of a gene.The hydrogen bonds between the two DNA strands in the gene break, separating the strands, and the DNA molecule uncoils at that point, exposing some of the bases.One of the strands is then used as a template to make an mRNA copy.vma\\|Cytopla1)2)RNA j polymerase;f \/T |Nucleusl|Template \/ strand of DNA3)RNA njcleotides joined togethernucleotides4)5)The RNA polymerase lines up free RNA nucleotides alongside the exposed bases on the template strand.

In many cases, the family that founded the \nbusiness retains complete ownership of it. Family-owned \nbusinesses are very important in nearly all economies, \nespecially newly industrialising ones. It is estimated that \n80% of all businesses in South Africa are family owned \nand operated. Many family businesses are small \u00a0\u2013 65% \nof all small businesses in Malaysia are family-owned and \nmanaged. However, not all family businesses are small. In \nAsia, family businesses make up 50% of all public limited \ncompanies (67% in India) and the founding families \nstill retain a controlling interest (over 50% of shares). \nFamily businesses have several signi fi cant strengths and \nweaknesses \u00a0\u2013 see  Table 3.5.Disadvantages of small businesses Disadvantages of large businesses\n\u25a0 may have limited access to sources of finance\n\u25a0 the owner\/s has\/have to carry a large burden of \nresponsibility if unable to a ff ord to employ specialist \nmanagers\n\u25a0 may not be diversified, so there are greater risks of \nnegative impact of external change\n\u25a0 few opportunities for economies of scale\u25a0 may be di ff icult to manage, especially if geographically \nspread\n\u25a0 may have potential cost increases associated with large-\nscale production\n\u25a0 may su ff er from slow decision-making and poor \ncommunication due to the structure of the large \norganisation\n\u25a0 may o ft en su ff er from a divorce between ownership and \ncontrol that can lead to conflicting objectives\nTable 3.4 Potential disadvantages of small and large businesses\nStrengths Weaknesses\nCommitment:  The family owners o ft en show dedication in \nseeing the business grow, prosper and get passed on to future \ngenerations. As a result, many family members identify with \nthe company and have the incentive to work harder and \nreinvest part of their profits into the business to allow it to \ngrow in the long term.\nReliability and pride:  Because family businesses have their \nname and reputation associated with their products, they \nstrive to increase the quality of their output and to maintain a \ngood relationship with their stakeholders.\nKnowledge continuity:  Families in business make it a priority \nto pass their accumulated knowledge, experience and skills to \nthe next generation. Many family members become involved \nin the family business from a very young age. This increases \ntheir level of commitment and could provide them with the \nnecessary tools to run their family business.Succession\/continuity problem:  Many family businesses fail \nto be sustainable in the long term. On average only around \n15% continue into the third generation of the descendants \nof the founder(s). This high rate of failure among family \nbusinesses can o ft en be explained by the lack of skills and \nability of later generations or the splitting of management \nresponsibilities between several family members to give them \nall a role in it.\nInformality:  Because most families run their businesses \nthemselves, there is usually little interest in setting clear and \nformal business practices and procedures. As the family and \nits business grow larger, this situation can lead to ine ff iciencies \nand internal conflicts.\nTraditional:  There is quite o ft en a reluctance to change \nsystems and procedures, preferring to continue to operate \nas it was historically run. Lack of innovation could be a \nconsequence.\nConflict:  Problems within the family may reflect on management \nof the business and make e ff ective decisions less lik ely .\nTable 3.5 Strengths and weaknesses of family businesses34Cambridge International AS and A Level Business","125":"TOP TIP\nExchange rates are a very important Business topic.

The process is pretty similar to facilitated diffusion (see p. 38) \u2014 a molecule attaches to the carrier protein, the protein changes shape and this moves the molecule across the membrane, releasing it on the other side.There are two main differences between active transport and facilitated diffusion though:1) Active transport usually moves solutes from a low to a high concentration\u2014 in facilitated diffusion, they always move from a high to a low concentration.2) Active transport requires energy \u2014 facilitated diffusion does not.\u2022 ATP is a common source of energy in the cell.

This movement drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pj).6) This process of ATP production driven by the movement of H+ ions across a membrane (due to electrons moving down an electron transport chain) is called chemiosmosis (which is described by the chemiosmotic theory).7) In the mitochondrial matrix, at the end of the transport chain, the protons, electrons and 02 (from the blood) combine to form water.Oxygen is said to be the final electron acceptor.outer mitochondrial membrane intermembrane space inner mitochondrial membrane ---------------%---------------------High H\u2019 concentration H+ H+ H+ HH+ H+ H+\u2022P,H+Low H* concentrationATPATP synthaseTopic 5 A \u2014 Photosynthesis and Respiration\n","131":"762The Chi-Squared Testlust when you thought it was safe to turn the page... I stick in some maths. Surprise!The Chi-Squared Test Can Be Used to Check the Results of Genetic Crosses1) The chi-squared (%2) test is a statistical test that's used to see if the results of an experiment support a theory.2) First, the theory is used to predict a result \u2014 this is called the expected result.Then, the experiment is carried out and the actual result is recorded \u2014 this is called the observed result.3) To see if the results support the theory you have to make a hypothesis called the null hypothesis.4) The null hypothesis is always that there's no significant difference between the observed and expected results(your experimental result will usually be a bit different from what you expect, but you need to know if the difference is just due to chance, or because your theory is wrong).5) The x2 test is then carried out to compare the 'goodness of fit' of the observed and expected results(i.e. to compare how well the observed results match the expected results). The outcome either supports orrejects the null hypothesis.6) You can use the x2  test in genetics to test theories about the inheritance of characteristics. For example:Theory: Wing length in fruit flies is controlled by a single gene with two alleles (monohybrid inheritance).The dominant allele (N) gives normal wings, and the recessive allele (n) gives vestigial wings.Expected results: With monohybrid inheritance, if you cross a homozygous dominant parent with a homozygous recessive parent, you'd expect a 3 : 1 phenotypic ratio of normal : vestigial wings in the F, generation (see p. 156).Observed results: The experiment (of crossing a homozygous dominant parent with a homozygous recessive parent) is carried out on fruit flies and the number of F2 offspring with normal and vestigial wings is counted.Null hypothesis: There's no significant difference between the observed and \\ u i n n i \\ i' 111 _i' n 1111111' Mexpected results.

Here are two really colourful photosynthesis experiments for you to enjoy. Let's chop up some plants and marvel at the beauty of Biology...You Can Investigate the Pigments in Leaves Using Chromatography1) All plants contain several different photosynthetic pigments in their leaves.Each pigment absorbs a different wavelength of light, so having more than one type of pigment increases the range of wavelengths of light that a plant can absorb.2) In addition to photosynthetic pigments, some plants also have other pigments in their leaves,which play other essential roles, e.g. protecting the leaves from excessive UV radiation.Different species of plants contain different proportions and mixtures of pigments.3) You can use thin layer chromatography (TLC) todetermine what pigments are present in the leaves of a plant. Like all chromatography, TLC involves:4) A sample of pigments can be extracted from the plant and put on the TLC plate. When the plate is placed vertically in the solvent, the solvent moves upwards through the gel, carrying the dissolved pigments with it.Some pigments will travel faster or further through the gel than others, which separates them out.5) It's possible to identify a certain pigment by calculating its Rf value and looking it up in a database. The Rf value is the distance a substance has moved through the gel in relation to the solvent. Each pigment has a specific Rf value.A mobile phase \u2014 where molecules can move. In TLC, this is a liquid solvent.A stationary phase \u2014 where molecules can't move. In TLC, this consists of a solid (e.g. glass) plate with a thin layer of gel (e.g. silica gel) on top.TLC can be Used to Compare the Pigments in Different PlantsThis example shows you how to use TLC to compare the pigments present in shade-tolerant plants andshade-intolerant plants.

Two distinct layers will form in the liquid\u2014 the top layer is the pigments mixed in with the petroleum ether.3) Transfer some of the liquid from the top layer into a second test tube with some anhydrous sodium sulfate.4) Draw a horizontal pencil line near the bottom of a TLC plate.Build up a single concentrated spot of the liquid from step 3 on the line by applying several drops and ensuring each one is drybefore the next is added. This is the point of origin.5) Once the point of origin is completely dry, put the plate into a small glasscontainer with some prepared solvent (e.g. a mixture of propanone, cyclohexaneand petroleum ether) \u2014 just enough so that the point of origin is a little bit above solvent the solvent. Put a lid on the container and leave the plate to develop. As the solvent spreads up the plate, the different pigments move with it, but at different rates \u2014 so they separate.6) When the solvent has nearly reached the top, take the plate out and mark the solvent front (the furthest point the solvent has reached) with a pencil and leave the plate to dry in a well-ventilated place.7) There should be several new coloured spots on the chromatography plate between the point of origin and the solvent front. These are the separated pigments. You can calculate their Rf values and look them up in a database to identify what the pigments are.8) Repeat the process for the shade-intolerant plant you're investigating and compare the pigments present in their leaves.solvent frontspcts of separated pigmentspoint of origin\ndistance travelled by spot distance travelled by solventYou may find that the mixture of pigments in the leaves of the shade-tolerant plant is quite different compared to the shade- intolerant plant. Ore way that shade-tolerant plants can adapt to the light conditions in their environment is by possessing a different proportion of photosynthetic pigments, which allows the plant to make the best use of the light available to it. The mixture of non-photosyntetic pigments is also likely to be different. For example, the chloroplasts of shade-tolerant plants are adapted for photosynthesis in low light conditions, but really sensitive to higher levels of light. These plants sometimes produce dark red and purple pigments called anthocyanins, which are thought to protect their chloroplasts from brief exposure to higher light levels.Topic 5A \u2014 Photosynthesis and Respiration\n","133":"9 1A.2 CARBOHYDRATES 1 CHEMISTRY FOR BIOLOGISTS\n \u2022P entose sugars (n = 5) have five carbon atoms and the \ngeneral formula C5H10O5.

The arrangement of the atoms \non the side chains can make a significant difference to the way in which the molecule can be used by the body. The carbon atoms are numbered in order to identify the different arrangements.\nGlucose has two isomers (different forms): \u03b1-glucose and \n\u03b2-glucose. The two isomers have different arrangements of  the atoms on the side chains of  the molecule. The\u00a0different isomers form different bonds between neighbouring glucose molecules, and this affects the polymers that are made. Y ou will learn more about \u03b1- and \u03b2-glucose in Section 4A.5.\nDID YOU KNOW? \nHydrogenating some sugars reduces the energy they provide. When glucose is hydrogenated, it forms sorbitol (C\n6H14O6). Sorbitol \ntastes up to 60% sweeter than glucose but it provides less energy when it is used in the body (11\n kJg\u22121 compared to 17  kJg\u22121). The \ncombination of the very sweet taste and the lower energy count makes it useful as a sweetener for people who want to lose weight.

Two monosaccharides join in a condensation reaction to form a disaccharide, and a molecule of  water (H\n2O) is released. The \nlink between the two monosaccharides results in a covalent bond known as a glycosidic bond (see fig E). We use numbers to show which carbon atoms are involved in the bond. If  carbon 1 on one monosaccharide joins to carbon 4 on another monosaccharide, we call it a 1,4-glycosidic bond.

If only there was a way to stimulate memory cell production without getting the disease... well, there is \u2014 vaccination.Vaccines can Protect Individuals and Populations Against Disease1) While your B-cells are busy dividing to build up their numbers to deal with a pathogen (i.e. the primary response \u2014 see previous page), you suffer from the disease. Vaccination can help avoid this.2) Vaccines contain antigens that cause your body to produce memory cells against a particular pathogen, without the pathogen causing disease. This means you become immune without getting any symptoms.3) Vaccines protect individuals that have them and, because they reduce the occurrence of the disease, those not vaccinated are also less likely to catch the disease (because there are fewer people to catch it from). This is called herd immunity.4) Vaccines always contain antigens \u2014 these may be free or attached to a dead or attenuated (weakened) pathogen.5) Vaccines may be injected or taken orally. The disadvantages of taking a vaccine orally are that it could be broken down by enzymes in the gut or the molecules of the vaccine may be too large to be absorbed into the blood.6) Sometimes booster vaccines are given later on (e.g. after several years) to make sure that memory cells are produced.Antigenic Variation Helps Some Pathogens Evade the Immune System1) Antigens on the surface of pathogens activate the primary response.2) When you're infected a second time with the same pathogen (which has the same antigens on its surface) they activate the secondary response and you don't get ill.3) However, some sneaky pathogens can change their surface antigens. This antigen variability is called antigenic variation. (Different antigens are formed due to changes in the genes of a pathogen.)4) This means that when you're infected for a second time, the memory cells produced from the first infection will not recognise the different antigens. So the immune system has to start from scratch and carry out a primary response against these new antigens.5) This primary response takes time to get rid of the infection, which is why you get ill again.6) Antigenic variation also makes it difficult to develop vaccines against some pathogens for the same reason. Examples of pathogens that show antigenic variation include HIV and the influenza virus.7) Here's how antigenic variation affects the production of vaccines to help prevent people catching influenza:1) The influenza (flu) vaccine changes every year. That's because the antigens on the surface of the influenza virus change regularly, forming new strains of the virus.2) Memory cells produced from vaccination with one strain of the flu will not recognise other strains with different antigens. The strains are immunologically distinct.3) Every year there are different strains of the influenza virus circulating in the population, so a different vaccine has to be made.4) New vaccines are developed and one is chosen every year that is the most effective against the recently circulating influenza viruses.5) Governments and health authorities then implement a programme of vaccination using the most suitable vaccine.1st infection\n2nd infectiondifferent antigensThe oral vaccine was proving hard to swallow.\nTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","135":"38Exchange Across Cell Membranes \u2014 DiffusionOoooh it's starting to get a bit more exciting... here's how some substances can get across cell membranes without using energy, just what you've always wanted to know, I bet.Diffusion is the Passive Movement of Particles1) Diffusion is the net movement of particles (molecules or ions) from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.2) Molecules will diffuse both ways, but the net movement will be to the area of lower concentration. This continues until particles are evenly distributed throughout the liquid or gas.3) The concentration gradient is the path from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Particles diffuse down a concentration gradient4) Diffusion is a passive process \u2014 no energy is needed for it to happen.5) Particles can diffuse across cell membranes, as long as they can move freely through the membrane.111' h 1 I I I  I  I IF! , M,,,, (\/Polar molecules have Z ~ Partlal positive and negative ~ charges (see p. 20).

They're also non-polar, which makes them soluble in lipids, so they can dissolve in the hydrophobic bilayer.6) When molecules diffuse directly through a cell membrane, it's also known as simple diffusion.Facilitated Diffusion uses Carrier Proteins and Protein Channels1) Some larger molecules (e.g. amino acids, glucose) would diffuse extremely slowly through the phospholipid bilayer because they're so big.2) Charged particles, e.g. ions and polar molecules, would also diffuse slowly \u2014 that'sbecause they're water soluble, and the centre of the bilayer is hydrophobic (see page 36).3) So to speed things up, large or charged particles diffuse through carrier proteins or channel proteins in the membrane instead \u2014 this is called facilitated diffusion.4) Like diffusion, facilitated diffusion moves particles down a concentration gradient, from a higher to a lower concentration.5) It's also a passive process \u2014 it doesn't use energy.'fiAndy needed all his concentration for this particular gradient...Carrier proteins move large molecules across membranes, down their concentration gradient.

They're not even living things \u2014 they can only reproduce inside the cells of another organism (called the host). All viruses cause disease, and you need to know all about one particularly nasty blighter...HIV is the Virus That Causes AIDS1) HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that affects the immune system.It eventually leads to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).2) AIDS is a condition where the immune system deteriorates and eventually fails. This makes someone with AIDS more vulnerable to other infections, like pneumonia (see next page).3) HIV infects (and eventually kills) helperT-cells, which act as the host cells (see p. 28) for the virus. Remember, helper T-cells send chemical signals that activate phagocytes, cytotoxic T-cells and B-cells (see p. 44) so they're hugely important cells in the immune response. Without enough helper T-cells, the immune system is unable to mount an effective response to infections because other immune system cells don't behave how they should.4) People infected with HIV develop AIDS when the helper T-cell numbers in their body reach a critically low level.HIV has a Spherical StructureYou might get asked about the structure of HIV in your exam1) A core that contains the genetic material (RNA) and some proteins (including the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is needed for virus replication).2) An outer coating of protein called a capsid.3) An extra outer layer called an envelope. This is made of membrane stolen from the cell membrane of a previous host cell.4) Sticking out from the envelope are loads of copies of an attachment protein that help HIV attach to thehost helper T-cell.HIV Replicates Inside its Host\u2019s Helper T-CellsHIV (and all other viruses) can only reproduce inside the cells of the organism it has infected. HIV replicates inside the helper T-cells of the host. It doesn't have the equipment (such as enzymes and ribosomes) to replicate on its own, so it uses those of the host cell.Here's how HIV replicates:1) The attachment protein attaches to a receptor molecule on the cell membrane of the host helper T-cell.2) The capsid is released into the cell, where it uncoats and releases the genetic material (RNA) into the cell's cytoplasm.3) Inside the cell, reverse transcriptase is used to make a complementary strand of DNA from the viral RNA template (see p. 16-17 for more on DNA and RNA).4) From this, double-stranded DNA is made and inserted into the human DNA.5) Host cell enzymes are used to make viral proteins from theviral DNA found within the human DNA.6) The viral proteins are assembled into new viruses, which bud from the cell and go on to infect other cells.During the initial infection period, HIV replicates rapidly and the infected person may experience severe flu-likesymptoms. After this period, HIV replication drops to a lower level. This is the latency period. During the latency period (which can last for years), the infected person won't experience any symptoms.Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\u00a9HIVhelper T cellDNA\u00a9\u00aev \u201c \u201c  DAttachment protein CapsidS1 , \" \"........................u-n,,,,,._ ttachnient proteins can also -EnvelopeGeneticmaterialReverse transcriptase\n","137":"io4 Topic 5 A \u2014 Photosynthesis and RespirationPhotosynthesis, Respiration and ATPAll organisms need energy for life processes (and you'll need some for revising), so it's pretty important stuff.

Here's a quick recap:AdenineATPPhosphate groupsPhosphate bond1) A cell can't get its energy directly from glucose.2) So, in respiration, the energy released from glucose is used to make ATP (adenosine triphosphate).ATP carries energy around the cell to where it's needed.3) ATP is synthesised via a condensation reaction between ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (P.) using energy from an energy-releasing reaction, e.g. the breakdown of glucose in respiration. The energy is stored as chemical energy in the phosphate bond. The enzyme ATP synthase catalyses this reaction.4) ATP diffuses to the part of the cell that needs energy.5) Here, it's hydrolysed back into ADP and inorganic phosphate (P;). Chemical energy is releasedfrom the phosphate bond and used by the cell. ATP hydrolase catalyses this reaction.6) The ADP and inorganic phosphate are recycled and the process starts again.Topic 5 A \u2014 Photosynthesis and Respiration\n","138":"106PhotosynthesisRight, pen at the ready.

Finally, take a deep breath and here we go...Photosynthesis Takes Place in the Chloroplasts of Plant Cells1) Chloroplasts are flattened organelles surrounded by a double membrane. They are found in plant cells.2) Thylakoids (fluid-filled sacs) are stacked up in the chloroplast into structures called grana (singular = granum).The grana are linked together by bits of thylakoid membrane called lamellae (singular = lamella).4) Chloroplasts contain photosynthetic pigments (e.g. chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotene). These are coloured substances that absorb the light energy needed for photosynthesis. The pigments are found in the thylakoid membranes \u2014 they're attached to proteins. The protein and pigment is called a photosystem.5) There are two photosystems used by plants to capture light energy.Photosystem I (or PSI) absorbs light best at a wavelength of 700 nm and photosystem II (PSII) absorbs light best at 680 nm.6) Contained within the inner membrane of the chloroplast and surrounding the thylakoids is a gel-like substance called the stroma. It contains enzymes, sugars and organic acids.7) Carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis and not used straight away are stored as starch grains in the stroma.outer memb'aneinner membrane stromathylakoid thylakoidmembrane lamellagranum(thylakoidcf arHPhotosynthesis can be Split into Two StagesThere are actually two stages that make up photosynthesis:crsmmammmm________cn- See p.' 108 for \\oad% more* * ' \u20141) As the name suggests, this reaction needs light energy.2) It takes place in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts.3) Here, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll (and other photosynthetic pigments) in the photosystems. The light energy excites the electrons in the chlorophyll, leading to their eventual release from the molecule.The chlorophyll has been photoionised.4) Some of the energy from the released electrons is used to add a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP, and some is used to reduce NADP to form reduced NADP. ATP transfers energy and reduced NADP transfers hydrogen to the light-independent reaction.5) During the process H^O is oxidised to 02.The Light-Independent Reaction1) This is also called the Calvin cycle and as the name suggests it doesn't use light energy directly.

This reaction is called photophosphorylation (see p. 105).2) Making reduced NADP from NADP.3) Splitting water into protons (H+ ions), electrons and oxygen. This is called photolysis (see p. 105).The light-dependent reaction actually includes two types of photophosphorylation \u2014 non-cyclic and cyclic.Each of these processes has different products (see next page).Topic 5A \u2014 Photosynthesis and RespirationThis diagram shows how the two reactions link together in the chloroplast.thylakoid membrane Q.< c 0 ,e\n","139":"60The Effects of Lung DiseaseIt's all very well when your lungs are working perfectly; but some pathogens (and even your lifestyle) can muck them up good and proper. This can make it more difficult to breathe and reduce the rate of gas exchange.Measures of Lung Function Can Help to Diagnose Lung DiseasesLung diseases affect both ventilation (breathing) and gas exchange in the lungs \u2014 in other words, how well the lungs function. Doctors can carry out tests to investigate lung function and diagnose a lung disease. You might be asked to interpret results from tests like these in your exams. Here are some terms you might come across:1) Tidal volume is the volume of air in each breath \u2014 usually between 0.4 dm* and 0.5 dm* for adults.2) Ventilation rate is the number of breaths per minute. For a healthy person at rest it's about 15 breaths.3) Forced expiratory volumet (FEV1) is the maximum volume of air that can be breathed out in 1 second.4) Forced vital capacity (FVC) is the maximum volume of air it is possible to sV\\n m u n m i m ibreathe forcefully out of the lungs after a really deep breath in. \u201c stan s \u00b0r. z0\/1 - decimetres cubed, -X 1 dm3 is the same -You can figure out tidal volume, ventilation rate and other measures of breathing from the graph produced from a spirometer (a fancy machine that scientists and doctors use to measure the volume of air breathed in and out):9. as a litre. :\nMeasuring tidal volume is one of the hardest jobs in the world.Different Diseases Affect the Lungs in Different WaysHere are some examples of different lung diseases and how they affect breathing.Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB)1) When someone becomes infected with tuberculosis bacteria, immune system cells build a wall around the bacteria in the lungs. This forms small, hard lumps known as tubercles.2) Infected tissue within the tubercles dies and the gaseous exchange surface is damaged, so tidal volume is decreased.3) Tuberculosis also causes fibrosis (see below), which further reduces the tidal volume.4) A reduced tidal volume means less air can be inhaled with each breath. In order to take in enough oxygen, patients have to breathe faster, i.e. ventilation rate is increased.5) Common symptoms include a persistent cough, coughing up blood and mucus, chest pains, shortness of breath and fatigue.Fibrosis1) Fibrosis is the formation of scar tissue in the lungs.This can be the result of an infection or exposure to substances like asbestos or dust.2) Scar tissue is thicker and less elastic than normal lung tissue.3) This means that the lungs are less able to expand and so can't hold as much air as normal \u2014 tidal volume is reduced, and so is FVC (i.e. a smaller volume of air can be forcefully breathed out).4) There's a reduction in the rate of gaseous exchange \u2014 diffusion is slower across a thicker scarred membrane.5) Symptoms of fibrosis include shortness of breath, a dry cough, chest pain, fatigue and weakness.6) Fibrosis sufferers have a faster ventilation rate than normal \u2014 to get enough air into their lungs to oxygenate their blood.Topic 3A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","140":"14Enzyme-Controlled ReactionsScience isn't all about words and theory\\ it's also about getting your pipette dirty and making bad smells (in the name of discovery of course).

It's easy to measure the volume of oxygen produced and to work out how fast it's given off. The diagram below shows the apparatus you'll need. The oxygen released displaces the water from the measuring cylinder. (A stand and clamp would also be pretty useful to hold the cylinder upside down, as would a stopwatch and a water bath.)Here's how to carry out the experiment:1)2)3)4)5)6)7)Set up boiling tubes containing the same volume and concentration of hydrogen peroxide.To keep the pH constant, add equal volumes of a suitable buffer solution to each tube.(A buffer solution is able to resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or alkali are added.)Set up the rest of the apparatus as shown in the diagram.Put each boiling tube in a water bath set to aupside down measuring cylindervolume ofdelivery tubeboiling tubehydrogen peroxide solution and catalase enzymeoxygen produced per minute is measuredtrough of <'*== waterdifferent temperature (e.g. 10 \u00b0C, 20 \u00b0C, 30 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C) along with another tube containing catalase (wait 5 minutes before moving onto the next step so the enzyme gets up to temperature).Use a pipette to add (he same volume and concentration of catalase to each boiling tube.

The diagram shows how the experiment can be set up. You'll need the apparatus shown in the diagram as well as a stopwatch. A drop of iodine in potassium iodide is put into each well on a spotting tile. A known concentration of amylase and starch are then mixed together in a test tube. A dropping pipette is used to put a drop of this mixture into one of the wells containing the iodine solution on the spotting tile at regular intervals and the resulting colour is observed. The iodine solution goes dark blue-black when starch is present but remains its normal browny-orange colour when there's no starch around. You can see how fast amylase is working by recording how long it takes for the iodine solution to no longer turn blue-black when starch\/amylase mixture is added. Repeat the experiment using different concentrations of amylase. Make sure that you also repeat the experiment three times at each amylase concentration.The experiments above show you how you can investigate the effects of temperature and enzyme concentration on the rate of enzyme-controlled reactions. You can also alter these experiments to investigate the effect of a different variable, such as pH (by adding a buffer solution with a different pH to each test tube) or substrate concentration (you could use serial dilutions to make substrate solutions with different concentrations). The key to experiments like this is to remember to only change one variable \u2014 everything else should stay the same.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","141":"Management and managers\nManagers  \u2018get things done\u2019 \u00a0\u2013 not by doing all jobs \nthemselves but by working with and delegating to \nother people. Managers do not all use the same style \nof leadership and di ff erent managers will approach \nproblems and decisions in very di ff erent ways, but the key \nfunctions of management are common to all. Th ese are \nbest explained by reference to some of the best-known \nmanagement writers, such as Fayol and Drucker. By \ncombining the main ideas of these two writers we can \narrive at the following list of management tasks and \nfunctions.\nManager:  responsible for setting objectives, organising \nresources and motivating sta ff  so that the organisation\u2019s \naims are met.\nKEY TERM\nThe functions of management \u00a0\u2013 what \nmanagers are responsible for\n1 Setting objectives and planning: All good managers \nthink ahead. Senior management will establish overall \nstrategic objectives and these will be translated into tactical \nobjectives for the less-senior managerial sta ff . The planning \nneeded to put these objectives into e ff ect is also important. \nA new production or marketing objective will require the \nplanning and preparation of su ff i c i en t  r eso u r c es.\n2 Organising resources to meet the objectives: This is \nnot just about giving instructions. People throughout the \nbusiness need to be recruited carefully and encouraged to \ntake some authority and to accept some accountability via \ndelegation. Senior managers will ensure that the structure \nof the business allows for a clear division of tasks and that \neach section or department is organised to allow them to \nwork towards the common objectives.\n3 Directing and motivating sta ff :  This means guiding, \nleading and overseeing of employees to ensure that \norganisational goals are being met. The significance of \ndeveloping sta ff  so that they are motivated to employ all \nof their abilities at work is now widely recognised. This will \nmake it more likely that organisational aims are achieved.\n4 Coordinating activities: As the average size of business \nunits increases \u00a0\u2013 especially true for multinationals \u00a0\u2013 so \nthe need to ensure consistency and coordination between \ndiff erent parts of each firm increases. The goals of each \nbranch, division, region and even all sta ff  must be welded \ntogether to achieve a common sense of purpose. At a \npractical level, this can mean avoiding the situation where \ntwo divisions of the same company both spend money \non researching into the same new product, resulting in \nwasteful duplication of e ff ort.5 Controlling and measuring performance against targets: \nManagement by objectives establishes targets for all groups, \ndivisions and individuals. It is management\u2019s responsibility \nto appraise performance against targets and to take action if \nunderperformance occurs. It is just as important to provide \npositive feedback when things keep going right.\nManagement roles\nTo carry out these functions, managers have to undertake \nmany di ff erent roles. Henry Mintzberg ( Th e Nature of \nManagerial Work , 1973) identi fi ed ten roles common to \nthe work of all managers. Th ese are divided into three \ngroups (see Table 10.1):\n\u25a0 Interpersonal roles \u00a0\u2013 dealing with and motivating sta ff  at all \nlevels of the organisation.\n\u25a0 Informational roles \u00a0\u2013 acting as a source, receiver and \ntransmitter of information.\n\u25a0 Decisional roles \u00a0\u2013 taking decisions and allocating resources \nto meet the organisation\u2019s objectives.\nLeadership \u00a0\u2013 the importance of it and \nqualities needed\nLeadership  is a key part of being a successful manager. \nIt involves setting a clear direction and vision for an \norganisation \u00a0\u2013 oft en a new direction and vision if \ncircumstances demand it \u00a0\u2013 that others will be prepared \nto follow. Employees will want to follow a good leader \nand will respond positively to them. A poor leader \nwill o ft en fail to win over sta ff  and will have problems \ncommunicating with and organising workers e ff ectively. \nTh e best managers are also good leaders of people \u00a0\u2013 but \nsome managers are not. Managers that focus so much on \ncontrol and allocation of people and resources can fail \nto provide a sense of purpose or focus that others will \nunderstand and be prepared to follow. Without clear and \ncharismatic leadership workers may be very well managed, \nbut will they be inspired to help the leader and the \nbusiness take a fresh direction and achieve new goals?\nLeadership:  the art of motivating a group of people \ntowards achieving a common objective.\nKEY TERM\nWhat makes a good leader? Many studies have been \nconducted on this very point \u00a0\u2013 some argue that leaders are \nborn with natural assets that create an aura or charisma \nthat others will fi nd appealing. Other research is more \ninclined to support the view that leaders can be trained \nto adopt the key attributes of good leadership.

The right side only needs to get blood to the lungs, which are nearby.2) The ventricles have thicker walls than the atria, because they have to push blood out of the heart whereas the atria just need to push blood a short distance into the ventricles.3) The atrioventricular (AV) valves link the atria to the ventricles and stop blood flowing back into the atria when the ventricles contract.4) The semi-lunar (SL) valves link the ventricles to the pulmonary artery and aorta, and stop blood flowing back into the heart after the ventricles contract.5) The cords attach the atrioventricular valves to the ventricles to stop them being forced up into the atria when the ventricles contract.Captain Jeff reckoned the lock gates were just like a big heart valve \u2014 with enough pressure he would be able to force his way through.The valves only open one way \u2014 whether they're open or closed depends on the relative pressure of the heart chambers.If there's higher pressure behind a valve, it's forced open, but if pressure is higher in front of the valve it's forced shut. This means blood only flows in one direction through the heart.higherlowerpressurepressureJLlowerhigherpressurepressurevalve closedvalve openTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n","143":"62Interpreting Lung Disease DataIt's very possible that you could be asked to interpret some data on lung disease in the exam. So being my usual nice sell I've given you some examples to show you how to do it. I know it looks a bit dull but believe me, it'll really help.You Need to be Able to Interpret Data on Risk Factors and Lung Disease1) All diseases have factors that will increase a person's chance of getting that disease. These are called risk factors. For example, it's widely known that if you smoke you're more likely to get lung cancer (smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer).2) This is an example of a correlation \u2014 a link between two things (see page 213). However, a correlation doesn't always mean that one thing causes the other. Smokers have an increased risk of getting cancer but that doesn't necessarily mean smoking causes the disease \u2014 there are lots of other factors to take into consideration.3) You need to be able to describe and analyse data given to you in your exams.Here's an example of the sort of thing you might get:EXAMPLE 1 \u2014 SMOKING AND LUNG CANCER\nCcQ nsO5040O-C d5 Uun T5302010Percentage of males aged 16 and over who smoked manufactured cigarettes in Great Britain\u2022\/vYear\u0000ip No) cv nrooooo120iAge-standardised mortality rates for male lung cancer in the United Kingdom1003 CX- o80604020Year of deaths<0 kOYou might be asked to:1) Describe the data \u2014 The graph on the left shows that the number of adult males in Great Britain who smoke decreased between 1990 and 2012. The graph on the right shows that the male lung cancer mortality (death) rate decreased between 1990 and 2012 in the United Kingdom.2) Draw conclusions \u2014You need to be careful what you say here. There's a correlation (link) between the number of males who smoked and the mortality rate for male lung cancer. But you can't say that one caused the other. There could be other reasons for the trend, e.g. deaths due to lung cancer may have decreased because less asbestos was being used in homes (not because fewer people were smoking).Other points to consider \u2014 The graph on the right shows mortality (death) rates. The rate of cases of lung cancer may have been increasing but medical advances may mean more people were surviving (so only mortality was decreasing).You might also need to evaluate the way in which scientific data has led to government restrictions on the sources of risk factors. E.g.Responses to dataMedical studies in 1950s and 1960s documented the link between smoking and various forms of cancer, particularly lung cancer. The evidence prompted the first voluntary agreement between the UK government and tobacco companies in 1971, which stated that tobacco products and adverts should carry a health warning label. As of October 2008, picture health warnings were made compulsory on all UK boxes of cigarettes after studies suggested they were more effective than written warnings alone.Topic 3A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","144":"1BSPECIFICATION \nREFERENCE5  A THEROSCLEROSIS\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n \u25fcUnder stand the course of events that lead to atherosclerosis.\nCARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES\nProblems with the cardiovascular system have serious consequences.

It can begin in late childhood and continues throughout life. A plaque can continue to develop until it restricts the flow of  blood through the artery or even blocks it completely. Plaques are most likely to form in the arteries of  the heart (coronary arteries) and neck (carotid arteries).

Atherosclerosis begins with damage to the \nendothelial lining of  blood vessels. This damage can be caused by several factors, including high blood pressure and substances in tobacco smoke. Atherosclerosis usually occurs in arteries rather than in veins. This is because the blood in the arteries flows fast under relatively high pressure, which puts more strain on the endothelial lining of  the vessels and can cause small areas of  damage. In the veins, the pressure is lower so damage to the endothelium is much less likely.cardiovascular diseases\n31%\n27%9%33%communicable (infectious)\ndiseases, childbirth andnutritional conditions \ninjuries\nall other causes\ncardiovascular diseases\n31%\n27%9%33%communicable (infectious)\ndiseases, childbirth andnutritional conditions \ninjuries\nall other causes\n\u25b2 fig A  T his WHO data from 2017 \nshows cardiovascular disease is the biggest single cause of death around the world.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that damage to the \nendothelium occurs first and this is often caused by high blood pressure, often as a result of smoking.\nEXAM HINT\nLearn the stages of the development of atherosclerosis: damage to the endothelium of the arteries \u2192 inflammatory response \u2192 accumulation of cholesterol \u2192 atheroma \u2192 fibrous tissue\/calcium salts \u2192 plaque \u2192 narrowing\/loss of elasticity of the artery.1.11 1.10\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Without them, we'd all probably be dead by now.Monoclonal Antibodies can be used to Target Specific Substances or Cells1) Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies produced from a single group of genetically identical B-cells(plasma cells). This means that they're all identical in structure.2) As you know, antibodies are very specific because their binding sites have a unique tertiary structure (see p.44) that only one particular antigen will fit into (one with a complementary shape).3) You can make monoclonal antibodies that bind to anything you want, e.g. a cell antigen or other substance, and they will only bind to (target) this molecule.EXAMPLE: Targeting drugs to a particular cell type \u2014 cancer cells1) Different cells in the body have different surface antigens.2) Cancer cells have antigens called tumour markers that are not found on normal body cells.3) Monoclonal antibodies can be made that will bind to the tumour markers.4) You can also attach anti-cancer drugs to the antibodies.5) When the antibodies come into contact with the canccr cells they will bind to the tumour markers.6) This means the drug will only accumulate in the body where there are cancer cells.7) So, the side effects of an antibody-based drug are lower than other drugs because they accumulate near specific cells.monoclonalantibodyantigen binding siteanti-cancer drugdrug attached to antibodyantibody binds to tumour markers on cancer cellcell-surface antigen\/\\----------------------------No0No------------------------------------------------------------\u2014L\nnormal body cell tumour marker cancer cellEXAMPLE: Targeting a particular substance for medical diagnosis \u2014 pregnancy testingPregnancy tests detect the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) that's found in the urine of pregnant women:1) The application area contains antibodies for hCG bound to a coloured bead (blue).2) When urine is applied to the application area any hCG will bind to the antibody on the beads, forming an antigen-antibody complex.3) The urine moves up the stick to the test strip, carrying any beads with it.4) The test strip contains antibodies to hCG that are stuck in place (immobilised).5) If there is hCG present the test strip turns blue because the immobilised antibody binds to any hCG \u2014 concentrating the hCG-antibody complex with the blue beads attached.If no hCG is present, the beads will pass through the test area without binding to anything, and so it won't go blue.coloured bead antibody \u00a9 ^ to hCGhCG\nappflow of liquidIimmobilised antibody to hCGication areatest stripTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","148":"24Topic 2A \u2014 Cell Structure and DivisionEukaryotic Cells and OrganellesThere are two types of cell \u2014 prokaryotic and eukaryotic.

This helps them to survive in their environment...Plants Need to Respond to Stimuli TooFlowering plants, like animals, increase their chances of survival by responding to changes in their environment, e.g:\u2022 They sense the direction of light and grow towards it to maximise light absorption for photosynthesis.\u2022 They can sense gravity, so their roots and shoots grow in the right direction.\u2022 Climbing plants have a sense of touch, so they can find things to climb up and reach the sunlight.A Tropism is a Plant\u2019s Growth Response to an External Stimulus1) A tropism is the response of a plant to a directional stimulus (a stimulus coming from a particular direction).2) Plants respond to stimuli by regulating their growth.3) A positive tropism is growth towards the stimulus.4) A negative tropism is growth away from the stimulus.Phototropism is the growth of a plant in response to light. Shoots are positively phototropic and grow towards light. Roots are negatively phototropic and grow away from light.ShootsRootsGravitropism is the growth of a plant in response to gravity. Shoots are negatively gravitropic and grow upwards.Roots are positively gravitropic and grow downwards.Responses are Brought About by Growth FactorsThe men's gymnastics team were negatively gravitropic.1) Plants respond to directional stimuli using specific growth factors\u2014 these are hormone-like chemicals that speed up or slow down plant growth.2) Growth factors are produced in the growing regions of the plant (e.g. shoot tips, leaves) and they move to where they're needed in the other parts of the plant.3) Growth factors called auxins stimulate the growth of shoots by cell elongation\u2014 this is where cell walls become loose and stretchy, so the cells get longer.4) High concentrations of auxins inhibit growth in roots though.Indoleacetic Acid (IAA) is an Important Auxin1) Indoleacetic acid (IAA) is an important auxin that's produced in the tips of shoots in flowering plants.2) IAA is moved around the plant to control tropisms \u2014 it moves by diffusion and active transport over short distances, and via the phloem over long distances.3) This results in different parts of the plant having different concentrations of IAA.The uneven distribution of IAA means there's uneven growth of the plant, e.g:Phototropism \u2014 IAA moves to the more shaded parts of the shoots and roots,so there's uneven growth.shootIAA concentration increases on the shaded side \u2014 cells elongate and the shoot bends towards the lightIAA concentration increases V3on the shaded side \u2014 growth is inhibited so the root bends away from the lightGravitropism \u2014 IAA moves to the underside of shoots and roots, so there's uneven growth.s^00^ IAA concentration IAA concentration increases increases on the lower on the lower side \u2014 growth side \u2014 cells elongate so is inhibited so the root the shoot grows upwards grows downwards-------rootTopic 6 A \u2014 Stimuli and Responses\n","150":"What do businesses do?\nBusinesses identify the needs of consumers or other fi rms. \nTh e y  t h e n  p u r c h a s e  r e s o u r c e s \u00a0\u2013 or factors of production \u00a0\u2013 in \norder to produce goods and services that satisfy these needs, \nusually with the aim of making a pro fi t.

This can be harmful, which usually means that the mutated allele quickly dies out. However, some mutations can produce alleles that are beneficial to an organism (e.g. a protein is produced that works better than the original), helping the organism to survive in certain environments. When the allele codes for a characteristic that increases the chances of an organism surviving, its frequency within the population can increase. This process is known as natural selection. Here's how it works:1) Not all individuals are as likely to reproduce as each other. There's differential reproductive success in a population \u2014 individuals that have an allele that increases their chance of survival are more likely to survive, reproduce and pass on their genes (including the beneficial allele), than individuals with different alleles.2) This means that a greater proportion of the next generation inherits the beneficial allele.3) They, in turn, are more likely to survive, reproduce and pass on their genes.4) So the frequency of the beneficial allele increases from generation to generation.5) Over generations this leads to evolution as the advantageous alleles become more common in the population.Adaptation and selection are both key factors in evolution \u2014 the gradual change in species over time.Evolution has led to the huge diversity of living organisms on Earth.Natural Selection Leads to Populations Becoming Better AdaptedAdaptations help organisms to survive in their environment. They can be behavioural, physiological or anatomical. Here are some examples:(l) Behavioural adaptations\"Ways an organism acts that increase its chance of survival and reproduction. For example, possums sometimes 'play dead' if they're being threatened by a predator to escape attack.(2} Physiological adaptations\"Processes inside an organism's body that increase its chance of survival. For example, brown bears hibernate over winter. They lower their rate of metabolism (all the chemical reactions taking place in their body). This conserves energy, so they don't need to look for food in the months when it's scarce.3) Anatomical adaptationsStructural features of an organism's body that increase its chance of survival. For example, whales have a thick layer of blubber (fat) which helps them keep warm in the cold sea.Bob and Sue were well adapted to hiding in candyfloss shops.\nPractice QuestionsQ1 What is genetic diversity?Q2 Explain how a genetic bottleneck reduces genetic diversity.Q3 Give an example of a behavioural adaptation.Exam QuestionQ1 Tawny owls show variation in colour.

When gametes from two parents fuse together, the alleles they contain form the genotype of the offspring produced. At each locus, the genotype can be homozygous or heterozygous.Genetic diagrams can be used to predict the genotypes and phenotypes of the offspring produced if two parents are crossed (bred). You need to know how to use genetic diagrams to interpret or predict the results of various crosses, including monohybrid crosses. Monohybrid inheritance is the inheritance of a characteristic controlled by a single gene. Monohybrid crosses show the likelihood of the different alleles of that gene (and so different versions of the characteristic) being inherited by offspring of certain parents.

Stem cells could be used to grow organs for those people awaiting transplants.\u2022 They could improve the quality of life for many people \u2014 e.g. stem cells could be used to replace damaged cells in the eyes of people who are blind.Human Stem Cells Can Come from Adult Tissue or EmbryosTo use stem cells scientists have to get them from somewhere. There are three main potential sources of human stem cells:(5Adult Stem Cells1) These are obtained from the body tissues of an adult.For example, adult stem cells are found in bone marrow.2) They can be obtained in a relatively simple operation \u2014 with very little risk involved, but quite a lot of discomfort.3) Adult stem cells aren't as flexible as embryonic stem cells \u2014 they can only specialise into a limited range of cells, not all body cell types (they're multipotent).<\u00a3Embryonic Stem Cells1) These are obtained from embryos at an early stage of development.2) Embryos are created in a laboratory using in vitro fertilisation (IVF) \u2014 egg cells are fertilised by sperm outside the womb.3) Once the embryos are approximately 4 to 5 days old, stem cells are removed from them and the rest of the embryo is destroyed.4) Embryonic stem cells can divide an unlimited number of times and develop into all types of body cells (they're pluripotent).(2Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPS Cells)x\\l1 l M ' M I) | \/ | , | | |l, , , , (|- Inscription factors are - r proteins that control whether =- \u00b0r not genes are transcribed ~'\/a see Pa9e 190 for more Z \/n f'11 ii 11 \/ , \/111 M , M)Xs\"1) iPS cells are created by scientists in the lab. The process involves 'reprogramming' specialised adult body cells so that they become pluripotent.2) The adult cells are made to express a series of transcription factors that are normally associated with pluripotent stem cells. The transcription factors cause the adult body cells to express genes that are associated with pluripotency.3) One of the ways that these transcription factors can be introduced to the adult cells is by infecting them with a specially-modified virus. The virus has the genes coding for the transcription factors within its DNA. When the virus infects the adult cell, these genes are passed into the adult cell's DNA, meaning that the cell is able to produce the transcription factors.4) Induced pluripotent stem cells could become really useful in research and medicine in the future\u2014 see next page. At the moment though, more research into how similar they actually are to true pluripotent embryonic stem cells is needed before they can be properly utilised.Topic 8A \u2014 Mutations and Gene Expression\n","155":"150Control of Blood Glucose ConcentrationHomeostasis doesn't always work. One example of this is diabetes...Diabetes Occurs when Blood Glucose Concentration is Not ControlledDiabetes mellitus is a condition where blood glucose concentration can't be controlled properly. There are two types:1) In Type I diabetes, the immune system attacks the (3 cells in the islets of Langerhans so they can't produce any insulin. No one knows exactly what causes the immune system to do this.Scientists have found that some people have a genetic predisposition to developing Type I diabetes. They also think that the disease may be triggered by a viral infection.2) After eating, the blood glucose level rises and stays high \u2014 this is called hyperglycaemia and can result in death if left untreated. The kidneys can't reabsorb all this glucose, so some of it's excreted in the urine.3) Type 1 diabetes is treated with insulin therapy. Most people with Type I diabetes need regular insulin injections throughout the day, but some people use an insulin pump to deliver insulin continuously instead. Insulin therapy has to be carefully controlled because too much insulin can produce a dangerous drop in blood glucose levels \u2014 this is called hypoglycaemia.4) Eating regularly and controlling simple carbohydrate intake (intake of sugars) helps to avoid a sudden rise in glucose.1) Type II diabetes is usually acquired later in life than Type I. It is often linked with obesity and is more likely in people with a family history of the condition. Other risk factors include lack of exercise, age and poor diet.2) It occurs when the |3 cells don't produce enough insulin or when the body's cells don't respond properly to insulin. Cells don't respond properly because the insulin receptors on their membranes don't work properly, so the cells don't take up enough glucose. This means the blood glucose concentration is higher than normal.3) It can be treated by eating a healthy, balanced diet, losing weight (if necessary) and regular exercise. Glucose-lowering medication can be taken if diet and exercise can't control it. Eventually, insulin injections may be needed.Type II Diabetes is a Growing Health Problem1) Type II diabetes is becoming increasingly common in the UK. This has been linked to increasing levels of obesity, a move towards more unhealthy diets and low levels of physical activity.2) Type II diabetes can cause additional health problems, including visual impairment and kidney failure, so health advisors are understandably keen to educate people about the risks and reduce the incidenceof the disease. Some people also think the food industry has a role to play in tackling the problem.3) You need to understand the various responses to the increase in Type II diabetes and be able to evaluate them.To reduce the risk of developing Type II diabetes, health advisors recommend that people:\u2022 eat a diet that's low in fat, sugar and salt, with plenty of whole grains, fruit and vegetables,\u2022 take regular exercise,\u2022 lose weight if necessary.Campaigns like the NHS's 'Change4Life', aim to educate people on how to have a healthier diet and lifestyle, and so reduce their risk of developing conditions like Type II diabetes.Health advisors have also challenged the food industry to reduce the advertising of junk food (particularly to children), to improve the nutritional value of their products, and to use clearer labelling on products \u2014 allowing consumers to make healthier choices about what to buy.w 1111111111 u h 111 ii \\ 111 ii 111111 \\ \\ h 111,In response to criticism, some food companies have z Some people believe that diet varieties are not zattempted to make their products more healthy, e.g. 5 as 300^ ^or health as they are claimed to be, z.. r ,, 1 . 1 - e.q. there is some evidence to suqaest that\u2022 using sugar alternatives to sweeten tood\/drinks, z Jr \u0000 , . , ,. . ,. z 00 ^ artificial sweeteners are linked to weight gain. ^\u2022 reducing the sugar, fat and salt content of products. 111111 w 11 n n 1 u 1111111111 w 111111 uHowever, there is pressure on companies to increase profits.

Infectious diseases can be really nasty, but luckily there's an army of cells in the body that helps lo protect us \u2014 the immune system.Foreign Antigens Trigger an Immune ResponseAntigens are molecules (usually proteins) that can generate an immune response when clctected by the body.They arc usually found on the surface of cells and are used by the immune system to identify: pathogens (organisms that cause disease), abnormal body cells (e.g. cancerous or pathogen-infected cells, which have abnormal antigens on their surface), toxins and cells from other individuals of the same species (e.g. organ transplants).There are four main stages in the immune response:(T) Phagocytes Engulf PathogensA phagocyte (e.g. a macrophage) is a type of white blood cell that carries out phagocytosis (engulfment of pathogens). They're found in the blood and in tissues and are the first cells to respond to an immune system trigger inside the body. Here's how they work:1) A phagocyte recognises the foreign antigens on a pathogen.2) The cytoplasm of the phagocyte moves round the pathogen, engulfing it.3) The pathogen is now contained in a phagocytic vacuole (a bubble) in the cytoplasm of the phagocyte.4) A lysosome (an organelle that contain enzymes called lysozymes) fuses with the phagocytic vacuole. The lysozymes break down the pathogen.5) The phagocyte then presents the pathogen's antigens \u2014 it sticks the antigens on its surface to activate other immune system cells.nucleuscytoplasmlysosomeantigens on surface ofphagocyte engulfs the pathogenlysosome fuses with phagocytic vacuole(2) Phagocytes Activate T-cellsA T-cell {also called a T-lymphocyte) is another type of white blood cell. It has receptor proteins on its surface that bind to complementary antigens presented to it by phagocytes. This activates the T-cell. Different types of T-cells respond in different ways. For example, helper T-cells {TH cells) release chemical signals that activate and stimulate phagocytes and cytotoxic T-cells (Tc cells), which kill abnormal and foreign cells B-cells, which secrete antibodies (see below).Th cells also activate(3) T-cells Activate B-cells, Which Divide into Plasma CellsB-cells (also called B-lymphocytes) are also a type of white blood cell. They're covered with antibodies \u2014 proteins that bind antigens to form an antigen-antibody complex. Each B-cell has a different shaped antibody on its membrane, so different ones bind to different shaped antigens.1) When the antibody on the surface of a B-cell meets a complementary shaped antigen, it binds to it.2) This, together with substances released from helper T-cells, activates the B-cell. This process is called clonal selection.3) The activated B-cell divides into plasma cells.(V) Plasma Cells Make More Antibodies to a Specific AntigenPlasma cells are identical to the B-cell (they're clones). They secrete loads of antibodies specific to the antigen. These are called monoclonal antibodies. They bind to the antigens on the surface of the pathogen to form lots of antigen-antibody complexes,An antibody has two binding sites, so can bind to two pathogens at the same time. This means that pathogens become clumped together \u2014 this is called agglutination. Phagocytes then bind to the antibodies and phagocytose many pathogens at once. This process leads to the destruction of pathogens carrying this antigen in the body.variableregions(orange)constan regions (blue)heavychainAntibodies are proteins \u2014 they're made up of chains of amino acids.The specificity of an antibody depends on its variable regions, which form the antigen binding sites. Each antibody has a variable region with a unique tertiary structure {due to different amino acid sequences) that's complementary to one specific antigen. All antibodies have the same constant regions.Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","158":"36Topic 2B \u2014 Cell MembranesCell Membrane StructureYou might remember a bit about cell membranes from p. 25. Well now it's time to delve a little deeper...Membranes Control What Passes Through ThemAll cells are surrounded by membranes. In eukaryotic cells,many of the organelles are surrounded by membranes too.1)2)Cell-surface membranes surround cells. They are a barrier between the cell and its environment, controlling which substances enter and leave the cell. They're partially permeable \u2014 they let some molecules through but not others. Substances can move across the cell-surface membrane by diffusion, osmosis or active transport (see pages 38-43).The membranes around organelles divide the cell into different compartments \u2014 they act as a barrier between the organelle and the cytoplasm. They are also partially permeable and control what substances enter and leave the organelle.Cell Membranes have a Fluid Mosaic\u2019 StructurePartially permeable membranes can be useful at sea.The basic structure of all cell membranes is pretty much the same. They're composed of lipids (mainly phospholipids \u2014 see page 7), proteins and carbohydrates (attached to proteins or lipids).1)2)3)4)5)In 1972, the fluid mosaic model was suggested to describe the arrangement of molecules in the membrane.

They bind to the cholesterolhydrophobic tails of the phospholipids, causing them to pack more closely together.This restricts the movement of the phospholipids, making the membrane less fluid and more rigid.Cholesterol helps to maintain the shape of animal cells (which don't have cell walls). This is particularly important for cells that aren't supported by other cells, e.g. red blood cells, which float free in the blood.Topic 2B \u2014 Cell Membranes\n","159":"140Synaptic TransmissionNeurotransmitters Can be Excitatory, Inhibitory or Both1) Excitatory neurotransmitters depolarise the postsynaptic membrane, making it fire an action potential if the threshold is reached. E.g. acetylcholine is an excitatory neurotransmitter at cholinergic synapses in the CNS \u2014 it binds to cholinergic receptors to cause an action potential in the postsynaptic membrane \u2014 and at neuromuscular junctions (see below).2) Inhibitory neurotransmitters hyperpolarise the postsynaptic membrane (make the potential difference more negative), preventing it from firing an action potential. E.g. acetylcholine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter at cholinergic synapses in the heart. When it binds to receptors here, it can cause potassium ion channels to open on the postsynaptic membrane, hyperpolarising it.Summation at Synapses Finely Tunes the Nervous ResponseIf a stimulus is weak, only a small amount of neurotransmitter will be released from a neurone into the synaptic cleft. This might not be enough to excite the postsynaptic membrane to the threshold level and stimulate an action potential. Summation is where the effect of neurotransmitter released from many neurones (or one neurone that's stimulated a lot in a short period of time) is added together. There are two types of summation:Spatial summation1)2)3)Temporal summation_ + + + +Temporal summation is where two or more nerve impulses arrive in quick 4succession from the same presynaptic neurone.

Now you've enjoyed that poem, it's time to concentrate. I hope you like remembering reactions involved in respiration, because these pages have several.There are Two Types of Respiration1) The two types of respiration are aerobic (requires oxygen) and anaerobic (doesn't require oxygen).2) Both produce ATP (see p. 104), although anaerobic respiration produces less.3) Both start with the process of glycolysis (see below). The stages after glycolysis differ.Glycolysis Makes Pyruvate from Glucose1) Glycolysis involves splitting one molecule of glucose (with 6 carbons \u2014 6C) into two smaller molecules of pyruvate (3C).2) The process happens in the cytoplasm of cells.3) Glycolysis is the first stage of both aerobic and anaerobic respiration and doesn't need oxygen to take place \u2014 so it's an anaerobic process.There are Two Stages in Glycolysis Phosphorylation and OxidationFirst, ATP is used to phosphorylate glucose to triose phosphate. Overall there's a net gain of 2 ATP and 2 reduced NAD.Stage One \u2014 Phosphorylation]1) Glucose is phosphorylated using a phosphate from a molecule of ATP.This creates 1 molecule of glucose phosphate and 1 molecule of ADP.2) ATP is then used to add another phosphate, forming hexose bisphosphate.3) Hexose bisphosphate is then split into 2 molecules of triose phosphate.1) Triose phosphate is oxidised(loses hydrogen), forming 2 molecules of pyruvate.2) NAD collects the hydrogen ions, forming 2 reduced NAD.3) 4 ATP are produced, but 2 were used up in stage one, so there's a net gain of 2 ATP.ATPADPThen triose phosphate is oxidised, releasing ATP.glucoseDHnumber of carbons in the moleculeglucose phosphate |6C|ATPADPZ)Hhexose bisphosphate12 x triose phosphate4ATP2 NAD\n2 reduced NADIn aerobic respiration...1) The two molecules of reduced NAD go to oxidative phosphorylation \u2014 see page 116.2) The two pyruvate molecules are actively transported intothe matrix of the mitochondria for the link reaction (see the next page).In Anaerobic Respiration Pyruvate is Converted to Ethanol or LactateIn anaerobic respiration, the pyruvate produced in glycolysis is converted into ethanol (in plants and yeast) or lactate (in animal cells and some bacteria) using reduced NAD:Alcoholic Fermentation reducedCO.- NAD NADLactate Fermentation reduced NAD NADpyruvateethanalUethanolpyruvateylactate (lactic acid)The production of ethanol or lactate regenerates oxidised NAD.

These pages cover the facts behind the replication mechanism, as well as some of the history behind its discovery. This stuff is really clever. Honest.DNA Replicates by Semi-Conservative ReplicationDNA copies itself before cell division (see p. 32) so that each new cell has the full amount of DNA.The method is called semi-conservative replication because half of the strands in each new DNA moleculeare from the original DNA molecule. This means that there's genetic continuity between generations of cells (i.e. the cells produced by cell division inherit their genes from their parent cells).1)The enzyme DNA helicase breaks the hydrogen bondsbetween bases on the two polynucleotide DNA strands. This makes the helix unwind to form two single strands.Breaks the hydrogen bonds2)Each original single strand acts as a template for a new strand.

In a DNA helix, the strands run in opposite directions \u2014 they're antiparallel.The active site of DNA polymerase is only complementary to the 3' endof the newly forming DNA strand \u2014 so the enzyme can only add nucleotides to the new strand at the 3' end.This means that the new strand is made in a 5' to 3' direction and that 3'- DNA polymerase moves down the template strand in a 3' to 5' direction. Because the strands in the double-helix are antiparallel, the DNA polymerase working on one of the template strands moves in the opposite direction to the DNA polymerase working on the other template strand.DNA Polymerase\nDNA PolymeraseTopic 1B \u2014 More Biological Molecules\n","162":"53 1C.1 RISK, CORRELATION AND CAUSE CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH AND RISK\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\nIf  you know the number of  people in a population who are \naffected by a disease, it is possible to calculate the average risk of  developing that disease for a person within that population. But the risk is higher for some people than others, depending on their lifestyle and which genes they inherit.\nIt is possible to identify the risk factors that may contribute to \nthe cause of  a disease. Y ou can look at people who have the same factors (e.g. smoking) and compare their risk of  the disease with the average risk for the whole population. Using these techniques, it appears that there are a number of  factors that increase the likelihood that a person will develop atherosclerosis. If  many factors influence your chance of  having a disease, it is called a multifactorial disease. The study of  the patterns of  diseases and their causes is called epidemiology.\nWhen two different sets of  data change together, there may be a \nlink, which is called a correlation. For example, mortality data from a disease such as atherosclerosis may change in a similar pattern to a lifestyle factor such as smoking or lack of  exercise. However, this does not prove that one is the cause of  the other. They could both be caused by something else which would explain why they change in the same way. Correlation is not the same as causation \u2013 further research is always needed to demonstrate a causal link.\nFor example, fig B shows the percentage of  deaths in the  \nUAE from cardiovascular disease each year.

This means that the NnRr parent produced mostly NR and nr gametes. Some Nr and nR gametes were still made due to crossing over, but there were fewer Nnrr and nnRr offspring overall. As a result, a higher proportion of the offspring have their parents' phenotypes.An Epistatic Gene Masks the Expression of Another Gene1) Many different genes can control the same characteristic \u2014 they interact to form the phenotype.2) This can be because the allele of one gene masks (blocks) the expression of the alleles of other genes\u2014 this is called epistasis.Example 1In humans a widow's peak (see picture) is controlled by one gene and baldness by others. If you have the alleles that code for baldness, it doesn't matter whether you have the allele for a widow's peak or not, as you have no hair. The baldness genes are epistatic to the widow's peak gene, as the baldness genes mask the expression of the widow's peak gene.Example 2Flower pigment in a plant is controlled by two genes.

Humans need things like money and the newest mobile phone, but enzymes are quite content with the right temperature and pH.Temperature has a Big Influence on Enzyme ActivityLike any chemical reaction, the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction increases when the temperature's increased. More heat means more kinetic energy, so molecules move faster. This makes the enzymes more likely to collide with the substrate molecules. The energy of these collisions also increases, which means each collision is more likely to result in a reaction. But, if the temperature gets too high, the reaction stops.1) The rise in temperature makes the enzyme's molecules vibrate more.2) If the temperature goes above a certain level, this vibration breaks some of the bonds that hold the enzyme in shape.3) The active site changes shape and the enzyme and substrate no longer fit together.4) At this point, the enzyme is denatured\u2014 it no longer functions as a catalyst.optimum temperature11 nn 11,TemperaturepH Also Affects Enzyme ActivityO\u2019\" \" I M I | | | ,, , ,~ Every enzyme has an enzyme is r optimum temperature = denatured r For most human enzymes - r ,t,saro^37\u00b0C but some r _ enzymes, like those used in ~- biological washing powders, ~ ~ can work well at 60 \u00b0C ~All enzymes have an optimum pH value. Most human enzymes work best at pH 7 (neutral), but there are exceptions. Pepsin, for example, works best at acidic pH 2, which is useful because it's found in the stomach. Above and below the optimum pH, the H+ and OH ions found in acids and alkalis can mess up the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds that hold the enzyme's tertiary structure in place. This makes the active site change shape, so the enzyme is denatured.Enzyme Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction1) The more enzyme molecules there are in a solution,the more likely a substrate molecule is to collide with one and form an enzyme-substrate complex. So increasing the concentration of the enzyme increases the rate of reaction.2) But, if the amount of substrate is limited, there comes a point when there's more than enough enzyme molecules to deal with all the available substrate, so adding more enzyme has no further effect.steady increase as more active sites are available \\if substrate amount is limited, an increase in enzyme concentration eventually has no further effectEnzyme ConcentrationSubstrate Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction Up to a Pointsteady increase as more substrate molecules are availableall active sites used \u2014 increase in substrate concentration has no further effectSubstrate Concentration1) The higher the substrate concentration, the faster the reaction \u2014 more substrate molecules means a collision between substrate and enzyme is more likely and so more active sites will be used. This is only true up until a 'saturation' point though. After that, there are so many substrate molecules that the enzymes have about as much as they can cope with(all the active sites are full), and adding more makes no difference.2) Substrate concentration decreases with time during a reaction (unless more substrate is added to the reaction mixture), so if no other variables are changed, the rate of reaction will decrease over time too. This makes the initial rate of reaction (the reaction rate at the start) the highest rate of reaction.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","169":"88Topic 4B \u2014 Diversity, Classification and VariationMeiosis and Genetic VariationAhh, now on to some really exciting stuff \u2014 the production of gametes (sex cells to you and me).This is how we end up different from our parents and our siblings \u2014 and yet, in some ways, strangely alike...DNA from One Generation is Passed to the Next by GametesHaploid nucleus (n) withEgg(gamete)1) Gametes are the sperm cells in males and egg cells in females.

Half these chromosomes are from the father (the sperm) and half are from the mother (the egg).5) During sexual reproduction, any sperm can fertilise any egg \u0000 produces zygotes with different combinations of chromosomes to both parents. This mixing of genetic materialin sexual reproduction increases genetic diversity within a species (there's more on genetic diversity on page 92).2 nfertilisation is random. Random fertilisationGametes are Formed by MeiosisMeiosis is a type of cell division. It takes place in the reproductive organs. Cells that divide by meiosis are diploid to start with, but the cells that are formed from meiosis are haploid \u2014 the chromosome number halves. Without meiosis, you'd get double the number of chromosomes when the gametes fused. Not good.1) Before meiosis starts, the DNA unravels and replicates so there are two copies of each chromosome, called chromatids.2) The DNA condenses to form double-armed chromosomes, each made from two sister chromatids. The sister chromatids are joined in the middle by a centromere.3) Meiosis I (first division) \u2014 the chromosomes arrange themselves into homologous pairs4) These homologous pairs are then separated, halving the chromosome number.5) Meiosis II (second division) \u2014 the pairs of sister chromatids that make up each chromosome are separated (the centromere is divided).6) Four haploid cells (gametes) that are genetically different from each other are producedIn the exams, you might need to spot when meiosis happens in an organism with a life cycle you haven't seen before, e.g. an insect or plant. Just remember (hat in any organism, meiosis is needed for sexual reproduction because it produces daughter cells (gametes) with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell.You might also be told how many chromosomes are in a parent cell, then asked to complete diagrams showing how many chromosomes will be in the daughter cells after the first and second divisions of meiosis. Remember that the chromosome number is halved during the first division.A Note About Homologous Pairs: Humans have 46 chromosomes in total \u2014 23 pairs. One chromosome in each pair came from mum and one from dad, e.g. there are two number 1's (one from mum and one from dad), two number 2s etc. The chromosomes that make up each pair are the same size and have the same genes. although they could have different versions of those genes (called alleles).

This may lead to a higher incidence of genetic disease.3) The founder effect can occur as a result of migration leading to geographical separation or if a newcolony is separated from the original population for another reason, such as religion.Example \u2014The AmishThe Amish population of North America are all descended from a small number of Swiss who migrated there. The population shows little genetic diversity. They have remained isolated from the surrounding population due to their religious beliefs, so few new alleles have been introduced.

The ones that do, follow a cell cycle. Mitosis is part of the cell cycle:The cell cycle consists of a period of cell growth and DNA replication called interphase. Mitosis happens after that. Interphase (cell growth) is subdivided into three separate growth stages.These are called G,, S and G,.GAP PHASE 2cell keeps growing and proteins needed for cell division are madeSYNTHESIScell replicates its DNA,ready to divide by mitosisMITOSIS (the cycle starts and ends here)GAP PHASE 1 cell grows and new organelles and proteins are madeMitosis has Four Division StagesMitosis is really one continuous process, but it's described as a series of division stages \u2014 prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. Interphase comes before mitosis in the cell cycle.Interphase \u2014 The cell carries out normal functions, but also prepares to divide.

The organelles are also replicated so it has spare ones, and its ATP content is increased (ATP provides the energy needed for cell division).Prophase \u2014 The chromosomes. condense, getting shorter and fatter. Tiny bundles of protein called centrioles start moving to opposite ends of the cell, forming a network of protein fibres across it called the spindle.

Different species have different versions of it depending on where each species lives. All of which adds up to two pages of no-holds-barred fun.\n\n@@@Oxygen Transport by Haemoglobin\n1) Red blood cells contain haemoglobin (Hb). 2) Haemoglobin is a large protein with a quaternary structure; it's made up of more than one polypeptide chain (four of them in fact). 3) Each chain has a haem group, which contains an iron ion and gives haemoglobin its red colour. 4) Haemoglobin has a high affinity for oxygen \u2014 each molecule can carry four oxygen molecules. 5) In the lungs, oxygen joins to haemoglobin in red blood cells to form oxyhaemoglobin. 6) This is a reversible reaction \u2014 when oxygen leaves oxyhaemoglobin (dissociates from it) near the body cells, it turns back to haemoglobin. There are many chemically similar types of haemoglobin found in many different organisms, all of which carry out the same function. Haemoglobin is found not only in all vertebrates but also in earthworms, starfish, some insects, some plants, and even in some bacteria.\n\n@@@Haemoglobin Saturation and Partial Pressure of Oxygen\n1) The partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) is a measure of oxygen concentration. The greater the concentration of dissolved oxygen in cells, the higher the partial pressure. 2) Similarly, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) is a measure of the concentration of CO2 in a cell. 3) Haemoglobin's affinity for oxygen varies depending on the partial pressure of oxygen: Oxygen loads onto haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin where there's a high pO2. Oxyhaemoglobin unloads its oxygen where there's a lower pO2. 4) Oxygen enters blood capillaries at the alveoli in the lungs. Alveoli have a high pO2 so oxygen loads onto haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin. 5) When cells respire, they use up oxygen \u2014 this lowers the pO2. Red blood cells deliver oxyhaemoglobin to respiring tissues, where it unloads its oxygen. 6) The haemoglobin then returns to the lungs to pick up more oxygen. There was no use pretending \u2014 the partial pressure of CO2 had just increased, and Keith knew who was to blame.\n\n@@@Haemoglobin Dissociation Curves and Oxygen Saturation\nA dissociation curve shows how saturated the haemoglobin is with oxygen at any given partial pressure. 100% saturation means every haemoglobin molecule is carrying the maximum of 4 molecules of oxygen. 0% saturation means none of the haemoglobin molecules are carrying any oxygen. The graph is 'S-shaped' because when haemoglobin combines with the first O2 molecule, its shape alters in a way that makes it easier for other molecules to join too. However, as the haemoglobin starts to become saturated, it gets harder for more oxygen molecules to join. As a result, the curve has a steep bit in the middle where it's really easy for oxygen molecules to join, and shallow bits at each end where it's harder. When the curve is steep, a small change in pO2 causes a big change in the amount of oxygen carried by the Hb. Where pO2 is high, such as in the lungs, haemoglobin has a high affinity for oxygen and a high saturation of oxygen. Where pO2 is low, such as in respiring tissues, haemoglobin has a low affinity for oxygen, which means it releases oxygen rather than combining with it, resulting in a low saturation of oxygen.\n\n@@@Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\nThis section serves as a title or introduction to the topic covering more exchange and transport systems, indicating a transition to new content in the provided text.","1":"@@@Classification of Organisms\nFor hundreds of years people have been putting organisms into groups to make it easier to recognize and name them. For example, my brother is a member of the species Idioto bigearian (Latin for idiots with big ears).\n\n@@@Phylogeny Tells Us About the Evolutionary History of Organisms\nPhylogeny is the study of the evolutionary history of groups of organisms. Phylogeny tells us who's related to whom and how closely related they are. All organisms have evolved from shared common ancestors (relatives). This can be shown on a phylogenetic tree, like this one. This tree shows the relationship between members of the Hominidae family (great apes and humans). The first branch point represents a common ancestor of all the family members. This ancestor is now extinct. Orangutans were the first group to diverge (evolve to become a different species) from this common ancestor. Each of the following branch points represents another common ancestor from which a different group diverged. Gorillas diverged next, then humans, closely followed by bonobos and chimpanzees. Closely related species diverged away from each other most recently. E.g. humans and chimpanzees are closely related, as they diverged very recently. You can see this because their branches are close together. Gorilla\n\n@@@Classification is All About Grouping Together Related Organisms\nTaxonomy is the science of classification. It involves naming organisms and organizing them into groups. This makes it easier to identify and study them. Scientists now take into account phylogeny when classifying organisms, and group organisms according to their evolutionary relationships. There are eight levels of groups used to classify organisms. These groups are called taxa. Each group is called a taxon. The groups are arranged in a hierarchy, with the largest groups at the top and the smallest groups at the bottom. Organisms can only belong to one group at each level in the hierarchy \u2014 there's no overlap. Organisms are first sorted into three large groups (or taxa) called domains \u2014 the Eukarya, Bacteria, and Archaea. Related organisms in a domain are then sorted into slightly smaller groups called kingdoms, e.g., all animals are in the animal kingdom. More closely related organisms from that kingdom are then grouped into a phylum, then grouped into a class, and so on down the eight levels of the hierarchy. \n\nDomain\nKingdom\nPhylum\nClass\nOrder\nFamily\nGenus\nSpecies\n\n- You need to learn the names and the order of the groups -\n\nAs you move down the hierarchy, there are more groups at each level but fewer organisms in each group. The organisms in each group also become more closely related. The hierarchy ends with species \u2014 the groups that contain only one type of organism (e.g. humans, dogs, E. coli). You need to learn the definition of a species: A species is a group of similar organisms able to reproduce to give fertile offspring. Scientists constantly update classification systems because of discoveries about new species and new evidence about known organisms (e.g., DNA sequence data \u2014 see page 98).\n\nTopic 4B \u2014 Diversity, Classification, and Variation","2":"@@@Homeostasis Basics\nAh, there's nothing like learning a nice long word to start you off on a new section \u2014 welcome to homeostasis. Homeostasis is the maintenance of a stable internal environment. Changes in your external environment can affect your internal environment\u2014the blood and tissue fluid that surrounds your cells. Homeostasis involves control systems that keep your internal environment roughly constant (within certain limits). Keeping your internal environment stable is vital for cells to function normally and to stop them being damaged. It's particularly important to maintain the right core body temperature and blood pH. This is because temperature and pH affect enzyme activity, and enzymes control the rate of metabolic reactions:\n- If body temperature is too high (e.g., 40 \u00b0C) enzymes may become denatured. The enzyme's molecules vibrate too much, which breaks the hydrogen bonds that hold them in their 3D shape. The shape of the enzyme's active site is changed and it no longer works as a catalyst. This means metabolic reactions are less efficient.\n- If body temperature is too low enzyme activity is reduced, slowing the rate of metabolic reactions.\n- The highest rate of enzyme activity happens at their optimum temperature (about 37 \u00b0C in humans).\n- If blood pH is too high or too low (highly alkaline or acidic) enzymes become denatured. The hydrogen bonds that hold them in their 3D shape are broken, so the shape of the enzyme's active site is changed and it no longer works as a catalyst. This means metabolic reactions are less efficient.\n- The highest rate of enzyme activity happens at their optimum pH \u2014 usually around pH 7 (neutral), but some enzymes work best at other pHs, e.g., enzymes found in the stomach work best at a low pH.\nIt's important to maintain the right concentration of glucose in the blood because cells need glucose for energy. Blood glucose concentration also affects the water potential of blood\u2014this is the potential (likelihood) of water molecules to diffuse out of or into a solution.\n- If blood glucose concentration is too high, the water potential of blood is reduced to a point where water molecules diffuse out of cells into the blood by osmosis. This can cause the cells to shrivel up and die.\n- If blood glucose concentration is too low, cells are unable to carry out normal activities because there isn't enough glucose for respiration to provide energy.\n\n@@@Homeostatic Systems Function Through Negative Feedback\nHomeostatic systems involve receptors, a communication system, and effectors (like the nervous system\u2014see page 128). Receptors detect when a level is too high or too low, and the information's communicated via the nervous system or the hormonal system to effectors. The effectors respond to counteract the change\u2014bringing the level back to normal. The mechanism that restores the level to normal is called a negative feedback mechanism. Negative feedback keeps things around the normal level, e.g., body temperature is usually kept within 0.5 \u00b0C above or below 37 \u00b0C. Negative feedback only works within certain limits though\u2014if the change is too big then the effectors may not be able to counteract it, e.g., a huge drop in body temperature caused by prolonged exposure to cold weather may be too large to counteract. Control of body temperature by negative feedback involves processes within the body that detect when the temperature is too hot or too cold and effectors respond appropriately to increase or decrease the temperature, thereby maintaining your internal environment around the normal level of 37 \u00b0C over time.","3":"@@@COMPARING OXYGEN TRANSPORT IN FETUSES AND ADULTS\nMammalian transport systems have distinct characteristics to efficiently transfer oxygen where it is needed. A key feature involves the oxygen concentration gradient between the mother\u2019s blood and that of her fetus. By ensuring that the gradient is as steep as possible, the transfer of oxygen to the fetus's blood is maximized. Fetal haemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen compared to the adult haemoglobin of the mother. This allows it to effectively take oxygen from the mother\u2019s blood and deliver it to the cells of the growing fetus. The graphical representation in figure F highlights how fetal haemoglobin (B) more readily saturates with oxygen at lower partial pressures compared to adult haemoglobin (A), thus ensuring efficient oxygenation of the fetal blood.\n\n@@@REMARKABLE DIVING ABILITY OF ELEPHANT SEALS\nElephant seals demonstrate extraordinary adaptations that enable their impressive diving capabilities, such as reaching depths of nearly 2 km and remaining submerged for up to 2 hours. These adaptations include having up to twice the volume of blood relative to land mammals of the same size, which accommodates extra spaces within their circulatory system dedicated to storing oxygenated blood. The increased number of erythrocytes per unit of blood\u2014which are thought to have more haemoglobin\u2014and the exceptionally high content of myoglobin in their muscles, contribute to their immense oxygen stores. Myoglobin has an even higher affinity for oxygen than haemoglobin or fetal haemoglobin, and in elephant seals, it is so plentiful that their muscles appear nearly black. With these physiological traits, elephant seals have evolved into consummate divers, with an enormous capacity to store oxygen for their extended underwater excursions as illustrated by the image in figure G.\n\n@@@EXAM PREPARATION TIP\nStudents preparing for exams must focus on precision in their descriptions. For example, when discussing haemoglobin, it should be noted that fetal haemoglobin specifically has a higher affinity for oxygen compared to maternal haemoglobin, rather than attributing this characteristic to the fetus or the blood in general. Precision in scientific descriptions is crucial to convey accurate understanding.\n\n@@@COPYRIGHT AND USAGE INFORMATION\nThis text is from an uncorrected proof, which means all content is subject to change at the publisher's discretion.

As water cools to 4 \u00b0C, it reaches its maximum density. As it cools further, the molecules become more widely spaced. As a result, ice is less dense than water and floats, forming an insulating layer and helping to prevent the water underneath it from freezing. It also melts quickly because, being at the top, it is exposed to the sun. It is very unusual for the solid form of a substance to be less dense than the liquid form. This unusual property enables organisms to live in water, even in countries where it gets cold enough to freeze in winter. Water is slow to absorb and release heat \u2013 it has a high specific heat capacity. The hydrogen bonds between the molecules need a lot of energy to separate them. This means the temperature of large bodies of water such as lakes and seas does not change much throughout the year. This makes them good habitats for living organisms. Water is a liquid \u2013 it cannot be compressed. This is an important factor in many hydraulic mechanisms in living organisms. Water molecules are cohesive \u2013 the forces between the molecules mean they stick together. This is very important for the movement of water from the roots to the leaves of plants (see Sections 4A.3 and 4A.4). Water molecules are adhesive \u2013 they are attracted to other different molecules. This is also important in plant transport systems and in surface tension. Water has a very high surface tension because the attraction between the water molecules, including hydrogen bonds, is greater than the attraction between the water molecules and the air. As a result, the water molecules hold together forming a thin \u2018skin\u2019 of surface tension. Surface tension is very important in plant transport systems, and also affects life at the surface of ponds, lakes and other water masses (see fig I).\n\n@@@EDUCATIONAL TIPS AND HINTS\nRemember that \"co\" means two similar things together, as in cohabit, and \"ad\" means two different things together. Without surface tension, a raft spider like this could not move across the water and hunt.

The arteries and veins serve as the main routes for the heavy traffic of blood flow, similar to large roads, while the capillaries represent the intricate network of narrow streets, facilitating the exchange of substances between blood and cells. This comparison highlights the economic parallel of transporting goods from production sites to consumers. The design of each type of blood vessel is specialized to perform its specific role within the body.\n\n@@@ARTERIES: STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION\nArteries have the critical function of conveying blood from the heart to the cells of the body, and their structure is optimized to handle the pulsatile nature of blood flow caused by the heart's contractions. Though most arteries carry oxygen-rich blood, the pulmonary artery and the umbilical artery during pregnancy are exceptions, carrying deoxygenated blood to the lungs and placenta, respectively. Structurally, the arterial system branches extensively, with luminal diameter decreasing as the distance from the heart increases. The smallest branches, known as arterioles, have lesser diameters. Arterial walls are composed of elastic fibers and smooth muscle, with proportions varying depending on their proximity to the heart\u2014those closer to the heart have more elastic fibers to accommodate pressure surges, while those further away have more muscle tissue. The inner lining, or endothelium, is smooth to enable seamless blood flow. The strength and elasticity of the major arteries enable them to expand and contract in response to the rhythmic beating of the heart, maintaining a consistent blood flow and creating the palpable pulse. As arterial blood travels further from the heart into peripheral arteries, the pressure declines. Educational note: Arteries universally transport blood away from the heart, characterized by thick walls and collagen to endure high blood pressure. Furthermore, when studying the structure and function of blood vessel types, it is important to recall that they are interconnected, forming a cohesive circulatory system.\n\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

This theory was still unproven until Meselson and Stahl devised an experiment to test it. At the time, some scientists believed in a conservative replication method wherein the original DNA strands would remain intact and the new DNA would consist of two entirely new strands.\n\n@@@THE CRUCIAL EXPERIMENT BY MESELSON AND STAHL\nMeselson and Stahl's pivotal experiment confirmed the semi-conservative replication theory. They utilized isotopes of nitrogen to differentiate between the original and newly synthesized DNA strands. In their procedure, bacteria were grown in media containing either heavy nitrogen (15N) or light nitrogen (^N). These isotopes allowed for the distinction between DNA of different densities when spun in a centrifuge. Bacteria originally grown in heavy nitrogen were shifted to a light nitrogen medium. If DNA replication was conservative, after one replication round, heavy, original DNA would settle at the bottom, and newly synthesized, light DNA would be at the top. However, if semi-conservative, the replicated DNA would have one heavy and one light strand, having an intermediate density.\n\n@@@RESULTS AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE EXPERIMENT\nThe results gleaned from the centrifuge showed the replicated DNA settled in the middle, indicative of semi-conservative replication; each DNA molecule was composed of one old (heavy) and one new (light) strand. This outcome validated not only the theory but also pointed to the universal application of semi-conservative DNA replication among living organisms.\n\n@@@REVISION AND PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS\nUnderstanding the mechanism of DNA replication is essential for exam preparation, where students may have to describe the process or evaluate the scientific work behind it. Questions such as the role of DNA helicase in replication or the differences between conservative and semi-conservative theories can arise. Similarly, students might be asked to elucidate the process of semi-conservative DNA replication in detail, as it\u2019s a critical concept in the study of biological molecules.","7":"@@@Overview of Respiration Experiments\nRespiration experiments can be conducted to gauge the rate at which respiration occurs. The text outlines several experiments to this end, particularly focusing on single-celled organisms like yeast, which can undergo both aerobic and anaerobic respiration. The rate of carbon dioxide (CO2) production during respiration serves as a proxy for determining the yeast's rate of respiration. Detailed steps are provided for both aerobic and anaerobic respiration experiments. These procedures involve varying temperatures or other conditions and measuring the resulting CO2 production using a gas syringe, which indicates the rate of respiration. The instructions also emphasize the importance of conducting control experiments and repeating the test to obtain reliable mean rates. Additionally, the text suggests that the methods can be modified to study the effects of different variables, such as substrate concentration or different types of respiratory substrates, on respiration rate.\n\n@@@Aerobic Respiration Experiment Protocol\nThe instructions for the aerobic respiration experiment begin with preparing a glucose substrate solution and stabilizing its temperature in a water bath. Yeast is added to the solution, and the production of CO2 is measured over time using a gas syringe. Specific steps detail how to set up the experiment, including the consistent use of a buffer solution, precise timing and measurement intervals, and the use of a control experiment without yeast. The procedure concludes with the repetition of the experiment at each temperature under investigation, emphasizing the importance of obtaining an average or mean rate of CO2 production. Accompanying this section is a note explaining that yeast respires aerobically until the oxygen in the tube is depleted and suggests alternative setups that can accommodate longer experimental durations or larger quantities of yeast and glucose.\n\n@@@Anaerobic Respiration Experiment Method\nFor anaerobic respiration, the text outlines a similar initial setup to the aerobic experiment but includes an additional step of sealing the test tube with liquid paraffin to prevent oxygen from entering. This ensures that the yeast undergoes anaerobic respiration. The subsequent steps overlay with the aerobic method, including measurement of CO2 production, timing, and recording at specific intervals. The use of gas syringe, bung, test tube, and water bath is reiterated, indicating the practical apparatus setup for carrying out the experiment.\n\n@@@Conclusion and Adaptability of Methods\nThe final portion of the text highlights the adaptability of these experimental methods to explore various factors that affect respiration. It stresses the importance of altering only one variable at a time, known as the independent variable, in order to maintain the validity of the results. It also makes a reference to where more information about variables can be found (\"see page 208\"), all within the broader context of studying photosynthesis and respiration in biological systems.","8":"@@@SPECIFICATION REFERENCE: THE MAMMALIAN HEART\nThe mammalian heart, a central component in most animal transport systems, is an organ responsible for the movement of blood throughout the body. In mammals, the heart is a complex, four-chambered muscular organ that resides in the chest cavity, shielded by the ribs and sternum. Remarkably, in an average lifetime, the heart will beat around three billion times and pump over 200 million liters of blood. This substantial figure underscores the heart's endurance and the crucial role it plays in the circulatory system.\n\n@@@LEARNING OBJECTIVES FOR THE MAMMALIAN HEART\nLearners are expected to:\n- Relate the structure and operation of the mammalian heart, including the major blood vessels, to its function.\n- Understand the cardiac cycle.\n\n@@@DETAILED STRUCTURE OF THE HEART \nA closer examination of the human heart reveals that it functions as two concatenated pumps that operate in synchrony. The right side of the heart takes in deoxygenated blood from the body and channels it to the lungs for oxygenation. Conversely, the left side receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and propels it throughout the body. A vital aspect of heart anatomy is the septum\u2014a thick, muscular wall that ensures blood from either side of the heart does not mix. The material of the heart is cardiac muscle, distinguished by its endurance and capacity to contract continually without fatigue. The study of cardiac muscle's unique properties is delved into in further detail in Book 2 Topic 7. A notable feature of the cardiac muscle is its abundant blood supply, provided by the coronary arteries, which furnish the tissue with oxygenated blood. Additionally, cardiac muscle contains a high concentration of myoglobin, a respiratory pigment with a higher affinity for oxygen than hemoglobin, thus serving as a reservoir for oxygen to sustain the heart's persistent contractions.\n\n@@@VISUALIZATION OF HEART ANATOMY IN ILLUSTRATIONS\nIn figure A, an illustration depicts the human heart, highlighting its structure, including the superior vena cava, right pulmonary artery, aorta, carotid arteries, right atrium, tricuspid valve, tendinous cords, bicuspid valve, left pulmonary artery, left pulmonary veins, and other components. Notably, it portrays the difference in thickness between the right and left ventricular cardiac muscle, corresponding to their respective functions. Figure B provides a visualization of the coronary arteries, which conspicuously delineate the path of oxygenated blood from the aorta to the heart muscle, essential for supplying the heart with necessary nutrients and oxygen while also eliminating carbon dioxide.\n\n@@@NOTICE: CONDITIONS OF PRE-PUBLISHED MATERIAL\nThis document contains an uncorrected proof and all content is subject to change at the publisher's discretion.

This contains synaptic vesicles filled with chemicals called neurotransmitters.\n4) When an action potential reaches the end of a neurone, it causes neurotransmitters to be released into the synaptic cleft. They diffuse across to the postsynaptic membrane (the one after the synapse) and bind to specific receptors.\n5) When neurotransmitters bind to receptors, they might trigger an action potential (in a neurone), cause muscle contraction (in a muscle cell), or cause a hormone to be secreted (from a gland cell).\n6) Because the receptors are only on the postsynaptic membranes, synapses make sure impulses are unidirectional \u2014 the impulse can only travel in one direction.\n7) Neurotransmitters are removed from the cleft so the response doesn't keep happening, e.g., they're taken back into the presynaptic neurone or they're broken down by enzymes (and the products are taken into the neurone).\n8) There are many different neurotransmitters, e.g., acetylcholine (ACh) and noradrenaline. Synapses that use acetylcholine are called cholinergic synapses. Their structure is exactly the same as in the diagram above.\n\nTypical structure of a synapse:\n\n- postsynaptic membrane\n- presynaptic membrane\n- synaptic knob\n- vesicle filled with neurotransmitters\n- synaptic cleft\n- receptors\n\n@@@Acetylcholine (ACh) Mechanism in Cholinergic Synapse\n\nThis is how a nerve impulse is transmitted across a cholinergic synapse:\n1) An action potential (see pages 136-137) arrives at the synaptic knob of the presynaptic neurone.\n2) The action potential stimulates voltage-gated calcium ion channels in the presynaptic neurone to open.\n3) Calcium ions diffuse into the synaptic knob. (They're pumped out afterwards by active transport.)\n4) The influx of calcium ions into the synaptic knob causes the synaptic vesicles to move to the presynaptic membrane. They then fuse with the presynaptic membrane.\n5) The vesicles release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) into the synaptic cleft\u2014this is called exocytosis.\n6) ACh diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to specific cholinergic receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.\n7) This causes sodium ion channels in the postsynaptic neurone to open.\n8) The influx of sodium ions into the postsynaptic membrane causes depolarisation. An action potential on the postsynaptic membrane is generated if the threshold is reached.\n9) ACh is removed from the synaptic cleft so the response doesn't keep happening. It's broken down by an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the products are re-absorbed by the presynaptic neurone and used to make more ACh.\n\nThe subsequent points describe how ACh interacts with the postsynaptic membrane:\n- ACh diffuses across and binds to receptors.\n- This may trigger the generation of a new action potential.\n- AChE breaks down ACh and the products are re-absorbed.\n\n@@@Topic Summary\n\nTopic 6B \u2014 Nervous Coordination","10":"@@@Diversity of Protein Functions\nProteins have a variety of functions. There are loads of different proteins found in living organisms. They've all got different structures and shapes, which makes them specialized to carry out particular jobs. For example: 1) Enzymes \u2014 they're usually roughly spherical in shape due to the tight folding of the polypeptide chains. They're soluble and often have roles in metabolism, e.g. some enzymes break down large food molecules (digestive enzymes, see pages 66-67) and other enzymes help to synthesize (make) large molecules. 2) Antibodies \u2014 are involved in the immune response. They're made up of two light (short) polypeptide chains and two heavy (long) polypeptide chains bonded together. Antibodies have variable regions (see p. 44) \u2014 the amino acid sequences in these regions vary greatly. 3) Transport proteins \u2014 e.g., channel proteins are present in cell membranes (p. 38). Channel proteins contain hydrophobic (water-hating) and hydrophilic (water-loving) amino acids, which cause the protein to fold up and form a channel. These proteins transport molecules and ions across membranes. 4) Structural proteins \u2014 are physically strong. They consist of long polypeptide chains lying parallel to each other with cross-links between them. Structural proteins include keratin (found in hair and nails) and collagen (found in connective tissue).\n\n@@@Protein Detection Using the Biuret Test\nUse the Biuret Test for Proteins. If you needed to find out if a substance, e.g., a food sample, contained protein you'd use the biuret test. Negative result Positive result There are two stages to this test. The test solution needs to be alkaline, so first, you add a few drops of sodium hydroxide solution. Then you add some copper(II) sulfate solution. \u2022 If protein is present the solution turns purple. \u2022 If there's no protein, the solution will stay blue.

Consequently, the potential difference becomes more negative than the usual resting potential, dropping below -70 mV. This effect is only temporary as the ion channels are subsequently reset.\n\n@@@Restoration to Resting Potential\nThe ion channels reset to their initial states following a deviation. Through the action of the sodium-potassium pump, the membrane is returned to and maintained at the resting potential. It remains this way until the membrane is excited by a new stimulus. Notably, the neurone cell membrane cannot be excited immediately following an action potential due to the ion channels recovering; sodium ion channels remain closed during repolarisation, and potassium ion channels are closed during hyperpolarisation, leading to the refractory period.\n\n@@@Propagation of the Action Potential as a Wave of Depolarisation\nThe movement of the action potential along the neurone is similar to a wave of depolarisation. It starts when sodium ions entering the neurone diffuse sideways, inducing the opening of sodium ion channels in the adjoining region of the neurone, allowing more sodium ions to diffuse into that part. This sequential opening of channels produces a wave of depolarisation that travels along the neurone, moving away from the sections in the refractory period, since these cannot generate an action potential. The process can be likened to a 'Mexican wave' in a crowd, where the inward rush of sodium ions creates a wave of activity along the membrane.\n\n@@@The Significance of the Refractory Period\nThe refractory period is integral to neuronal function for several reasons. Firstly, it prevents the immediate reactivation of ion channels, serving as a time barrier between successive action potentials. This restriction ensures that action potentials remain discrete and separate, establishes a limit on the frequency of nerve impulse transmission, and guarantees that action potentials are unidirectional, only traveling forward.\n\n@@@All-or-Nothing Principle of Action Potentials\nAction potentials operate on an all-or-nothing basis. If a stimulus is strong enough to reach the threshold, an action potential with a consistent voltage change will invariably be triggered, independent of the intensity of the stimulus. If the threshold is not met, no action potential will occur. Hence, a larger stimulus does not result in a more intense action potential; it only increases the frequency of action potential firing.\n\n@@@Overview of Nervous Coordination (Topic 6B)\nA summary provided indicates that this text forms part of the broader topic on nervous coordination, specifically covering the mechanisms of action potentials and neuronal signaling within the context of biological studies.","12":"@@@Reuters's Resurgence to Profitability\nReuters, one of the world\u2019s largest news agencies, has returned to profitability after several years of losses. It aims to increase value for shareholders, and the fact that Reuters\u2019s shares have risen 7% faster than average share prices suggests that the company is becoming increasingly successful. Profits are being made for two main reasons. Many jobs have been lost in the company in recent years as a result of the chief executive\u2019s policy of cutting costs. Secondly, an ambitious growth objective has been established to increase sales and this target is being reached. New products (such as electronic trading) and new markets (such as China, Russia and India) have allowed an increase in sales of over 6% this year. This is above the growth target that was set. Some analysts are predicting a 40% increase in profit for the company next year.\n\n@@@Activity 4.3 Instructions and Questions\nACTIVITY  4.3 [18 marks, 25 minutes]\n1 What evidence is there that Reuters is meeting its objectives? [4]\n2 Explain two benefits to the managers and other employees of the company from having clearly stated company aims and objectives. [6]\n3 To what extent does the policy of increasing shareholder value conflict with other objectives the business might have? [8]\n\n@@@Strategies Affecting Managers and Staff\n7 Maximising short-term sales revenue\nThis could benefit managers and staff when salaries and bonuses are dependent on sales revenue levels. However, if increased sales are achieved by reducing prices, the actual profits of the business might fall.\n8 Maximising shareholder value\nThis could apply to public limited companies and directs management action towards taking decisions that would increase the company share price and dividends paid to shareholders. These targets might be achieved by pursuing the goal of profit maximisation. This shareholder-value objective puts the interests of shareholders above those of other stakeholders. Chapter 5 considers the potential conflict between this objective and the aims of other stakeholder groups.\n\n@@@Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\n6 Corporate social responsibility (CSR)\nShould firms have objectives about social, environmental and ethical issues? Increasingly, there is general agreement that firms must adopt a wider perspective when setting their objectives and not just be aiming for profits or expansion. One reason for this is the much greater adverse publicity given to business activity that is perceived as being damaging to stakeholder groups and the wider world. Increasingly, influential pressure groups are forcing businesses to reconsider their approach to decision-making. Also, legal changes \u2013 at the local, national and EU level \u2013 have forced businesses to refrain from certain practices. Firms can no longer pay staff very low wages or avoid legal responsibility for their products. Managers clearly wish to avoid conflicts with the law or bad publicity.\n\nCorporate social responsibility: this concept applies to those businesses that consider the interests of society by taking responsibility for the impact of their decisions and activities on customers, employees, communities and the environment.\n\n@@@Trends Influencing Business Objectives\nThere are other reasons for these trends in business objectives \u2013 increasingly, consumers and other stakeholders are reacting positively to businesses that act in \u2018green\u2019 or socially responsible ways. Examples include:\n\u25a0 Firms that promote organic and vegetarian foods.\n\u25a0 Retailers that advertise the proportion of their products made from recycled materials.\n\u25a0 Businesses that refuse to stock goods that have been tested on animals or foods based on genetically modified ingredients.\n\nIn these cases, is the action being taken because trade and reputation might be lost if it is not or because such action is increasingly profitable? Might businesses be criticised for \u2018jumping on the corporate social responsibility bandwagon\u2019 rather than praised for their genuine concern for society and the environment? Conceivably, firms are being ethical or environmentally conscious because they have an objective that Peter Drucker, a famous writer on management, calls \u2018public responsibility\u2019, because they want to behave in these ways. Many consumer groups and pressure groups are still dubious as to whether these objectives are based on genuinely held beliefs or not. Chapter 5 discusses the impact of social and environmental pressures on business and business stakeholders in more detail.434: Business objectives","13":"@@@ Eukaryotic Cells and Organelles: Key Cellular Components\nEukaryotic cells are made up of numerous organelles, each performing specific functions vital for the cell's life processes. Most organelles are enclosed by membranes, distinguishing parts from the cell itself. Understanding the structure and function of each organelle is critical in biological sciences. However, it's important to note that while they may be individually highlighted in diagrams, these organelles are not standalone cells; they are subunits within a larger cellular structure.\n\n@@@ Cell-Surface Membrane: Gateway to the Cell\nThe cell-surface (plasma) membrane outlines the surface of animal cells and is situated just inside the cell wall in other cells. Primarily composed of lipids and proteins, this membrane has the crucial role of regulating the movement of substances going in and out of the cell. Additionally, it features receptor molecules that allow the cell to interact and respond to various chemicals, such as hormones.\n\n@@@ Nucleus: The Command Center\nOne of the most prominent organelles in a eukaryotic cell is the nucleus. It's a large organelle, enveloped by a nuclear envelope with multiple pores, and houses chromosomes made from protein-bound linear DNA, as referenced on page 82, and one or several nucleoli. As the control center of the cell, the nucleus regulates activities by directing the transcription of DNA. Through its pores, substances like RNA move between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The nucleolus has the specific role of assembling ribosomes.\n\n@@@ Mitochondria: Powerhouses of the Cell\nMitochondria are generally oval-shaped organelles, distinct for their double membrane; the inner membrane folds into structures known as cristae. Within its matrix, a variety of enzymes are involved in the process of respiration. Mitochondria are the sites of aerobic respiration and ATP production. High concentrations of these organelles can be found in cells that are highly active and require substantial amounts of energy.\n\n@@@ Chloroplasts: Facilitators of Photosynthesis\nIn plant and algal cells, chloroplasts are small, flattened structures surrounded by a double membrane. Within, thylakoid membranes exist, which are occasionally arranged into stacks known as grana, interconnected by lamellae \u2014 slender thylakoid portions. Chloroplasts are where photosynthesis occurs, with certain stages taking place in the grana and others in the stroma, a dense fluid within the chloroplast.\n\n@@@ Golgi Apparatus: The Processing and Packaging Plant\nAnother integral organelle is the Golgi apparatus, characterized by its fluid-filled, membrane-bound flattened sacs. Often found at the sacs' margins are vesicles. The primary functions of the Golgi apparatus include processing and packaging newly synthesized lipids and proteins. Additionally, it has the role of producing lysosomes, which carry out various functions, such as breaking down waste materials within the cell.\n\n@@@ Topic 2A \u2014 Cell Structure and Division\nThis topic covers the intricacies of cell structure and the process of cell division, highlighting how the myriad of organelles works together to maintain the livelihood of the cell and how cells replicate to sustain and develop an organism.","14":"@@@Quality of Service and Public Sector Considerations\nInstead, \u2018quality of service\u2019 measures are often used, such as the maximum number of days for a patient to wait for an operation. Even businesses earning revenue in the public sector, such as a country\u2019s postal service, may have among their objectives the target of maintaining services in non-profitable locations. Recent branch closures in rural areas by private-sector banks, in order to increase profits, make an interesting contrast.\n\n@@@Business Longevity and Shifts in Objectives\nThe number of years the business has been operating Newly formed businesses are likely to be driven by the desire to survive at all costs \u2013 the failure rate of new firms in the first year of operation is very high. Later, once well established, the business may pursue other objectives, such as growth and profit. These factors are summarised in Figure 4.5.\n\n@@@Hierarchical Breakdown of Business Objectives\nDivisional, departmental, and individual objectives Refer to Figure 4.6. Once corporate objectives have been established they need to be broken down into specific targets for separate divisions, departments, and, ultimately, individuals. Corporate objectives relate to the whole organisation. They cannot be used by each division of the business to create strategies for action until they have been broken down into meaningful targets focusing on divisional goals. These divisional objectives must be set by senior managers to ensure:\n- coordination between all divisions \u2013 if they do not work together, the focus of the organisation will appear confused to outsiders and there will be disagreements between departments\n- consistency with corporate objectives\n- that adequate resources are provided to allow for the successful achievement of the objectives.\nOnce the divisional objectives have been established, then these can be further divided into departmental objectives and budgets and targets for individual workers. This process is called management by objectives (MBO).\n\n@@@Implementation and Effects of Management by Objectives (MBO)\nManagement by objectives (MBO) If this process is undertaken after discussion and agreement with personnel at each level of the organisation, then it can be a very effective way of delegating authority and motivating staff. This approach would accord with McGregor\u2019s Theory Y approach (see Chapter 11). If, however, the targets at each level were merely imposed from above, as with McGregor\u2019s Theory X style, then motivation is likely to be low.\n\n@@@Definition of Management by Objectives and Hierarchy Implementation\nManagement by objectives: a method of coordinating and motivating all staff in an organisation by dividing its overall aim into specific targets for each department, manager, and employee.\nKEY TERM\nFigure 4.6 is an example of how the hierarchy of objectives could now look, incorporating the principle of management by objectives.

Enzyme activity can be prevented by enzyme inhibitors. Inhibition can be competitive or non-competitive.\n\n@@@Competitive Inhibition of Enzymes\nCOMPETITIVE INHIBITION involves molecules that bind to the enzyme that they inhibit. 1) Competitive inhibitor molecules have a similar shape to that of the substrate molecules. 2) They compete with the substrate molecules to bind to the active site, but no reaction takes place. 3) Instead, they block the active site so no substrate molecules can fit in it. Substrate Concentration affects how much the enzyme is inhibited and depends on the relative concentrations of the inhibitor and the substrate. 4) If there's a high concentration of the inhibitor, it'll take up nearly all the active sites and hardly any of the substrate will get to the enzyme. 5) But if there's a higher concentration of substrate, then the substrate's chances of getting to an active site before the inhibitor increase. So increasing the concentration of substrate will increase the rate of reaction (up to a point).\n\n@@@Non-Competitive Inhibition of Enzymes\nNON-COMPETITIVE INHIBITION is characterized by 1) Non-competitive inhibitor molecules binding to the enzyme away from its active site. 2) This action causes the active site to change shape so the substrate molecules can no longer bind to it. 3) They don't 'compete' with the substrate molecules because they are a different shape. 4) Increasing the concentration of substrate won't make any difference to the reaction rate \u2014 enzyme activity will still be inhibited.\n\n@@@Effects of Inhibitors and Substrate Concentration on Enzymes\nThe effect of inhibitors is such that substrate concentration changes do not affect the activity of non-competitive inhibitors, whereas competitive inhibitors can be outcompeted by increasing substrate concentration. Substrate concentration and the presence of inhibitors are crucial in determining the rate of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.\n\n@@@Interpreting the Impact of Enzyme Inhibitors\nPRACTICE QUESTIONS prompt the learner to draw graphs to show the effects of temperature and pH on enzyme activity and to explain the effect of increasing substrate concentration on the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The EXAM QUESTION relates to a) explaining how competitive inhibitors work and b) explaining how non-competitive inhibitors work.\n\n@@@Significance of Enzymes and Inhibitors in Biological Processes\nHuman enzymes function optimally in normal body conditions \u2014 a neutral pH and body temperature of 37 \u00b0C. Inhibitors such as cyanide can be lethal, as many poisons are enzyme inhibitors. Even though humans have thousands of enzymes, inhibiting just one can lead to severe consequences. However, some drugs like penicillin work by inhibiting enzymes, demonstrating that not all inhibitors have harmful effects.\n\n@@@Topic Information\nThe section belongs to Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules, which provides context for the ensuing information on enzyme inhibitors and their effects on enzyme activity.","16":"@@@Introduction to Proteins and Their Functions\nProteins play an array of roles and exist in a variety of forms. The introductory section answers fundamental questions regarding what proteins are and their appearance.\n\n@@@Proteins as Polypeptide Chains\nProteins are composed of amino acids, which are their monomers. When two amino acids join, they form a dipeptide; joining more than two forms a polypeptide. Ultimately, proteins are one or more polypeptide chains. There is even a humorous mention of someone named Grant and his dislike for dipeptides stemming from a personal grudge.\n\n@@@Amino Acid Structures and Variability\nAll amino acids share a general structure with a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R group which varies among different amino acids. This variation in the R group is what distinguishes the 20 common amino acids found in living organisms. The text also provides an interesting fact about glycine, the only amino acid without carbon in its side group. Its R group is simply a hydrogen atom.\n\n@@@The Process of Forming Polypeptides\nA condensation reaction between amino acids results in a polypeptide and the release of a water molecule. This reaction forms peptide bonds between the amino acids. The text also contrasts this with the hydrolysis reaction that occurs during digestion.\n\n@@@Hierarchy of Protein Structures\nExplaining the complex nature of proteins is facilitated by breaking down their structure into four distinct levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures. The primary structure is the unique sequence of amino acids. Secondary structure emerges from hydrogen bonds creating coils or folds in the polypeptide chain, known as alpha helices or beta pleated sheets. Tertiary structure involves further coiling and folding due to more intricate bonding, which forms the final 3D shape for single-chain proteins. Finally, the quaternary structure refers to the assembly of multiple polypeptide chains into a functional unit, representing the final 3D structure for proteins with multiple chains.\n\n@@@Educational Context Note\nThe text concludes by referencing the broader educational topic, indicating that this content falls under \"Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules.\" This note likely places the detailed discussion about proteins within a larger curriculum or textbook chapter exploring various biological molecules.","17":"@@@MAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS: ELASTICITY AND CONTROL IN ARTERIES\nIn the context of mammalian transport systems, particularly circulation in the blood vessels, it is important to recognize the role of the elastic fibres in artery walls. These elastic fibres are crucial for their ability to return to their original length to help maintain blood pressure, a process known as recoil. However, it must be noted that the elastic recoil does not aid in increasing the pressure but rather helps to maintain it\u2014hence it should not be misconstrued that the recoil contributes to pumping blood along the vessels. In the peripheral arteries, the muscle fibres in the vessel walls adjust by contracting or relaxing, which directly changes the size of the lumen and consequently controls the blood flow through the vessel. A smaller lumen results in greater resistance and therefore a reduction in blood flow, ultimately regulating the amount of blood that reaches an organ and modulating its activity. Information on this regulation will be expanded upon in Book 2 Topic 7. Figure B provides a visual representation of different tissues in various arteries, showing how collagen contributes to the general strength and flexibility of both arteries and veins.\n\n@@@CAPILLARY NETWORKS: STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION\nArterioles transition into networks of capillaries, diminutive vessels that pervade the tissues of the body. This capillary network forges a crucial link between arterioles and venules. Due to the extensive branching of capillaries between cells, proximity is ensured, allowing swift diffusion of substances between cells and the blood within these vessels. The small diameter of the capillaries means that blood flow is relatively slow through them, furnishing ample opportunity for diffusion to occur, as illustrated in Figure C. The structural simplicity of capillaries is highly adapted to their function; their walls are exceedingly thin and devoid of elastic fibres, smooth muscle, or collagen, ensuring a snug fit between individual cells while facilitating the rapid diffusion of substances between the blood and the cells. Capillary walls are constituted of a single, very thin cell layer, permitting the quick exchange of oxygen and other molecules such as nutrients and hormones out of the blood, and allowing carbon dioxide and other waste molecules to diffuse into the bloodstream. Blood delivered to the capillary network from the arteries is oxygenated and upon its departure, contains less oxygen and more carbon dioxide.\n\n@@@VEIN STRUCTURE AND THE EXCEPTIONS TO BLOOD OXYGENATION\nVeins hold the responsibility for transporting blood back to the heart, and most veins carry deoxygenated blood with a few exceptions. The pulmonary vein is one such exception, as it carries oxygen-rich blood from the lungs back to the heart, for circulation throughout the body. Another exception is the umbilical vein which, during pregnancy, transports oxygenated blood from the placenta into the fetus. The capillary networks are succeeded by tiny venules which combine to form progressively larger vessels leading back to the heart, as presented in Figure D. It is crucial to remember that since all veins direct blood toward the heart, they are under low pressure and consequently do not necessitate a thick wall. This information is conveyed as a learning tip to emphasize the distinct structural and functional characteristics of veins in the mammalian transport system.","18":"@@@Firms' Survival and Growth\nAlthough a high proportion of new firms fail, some survive and a few expand to become really important businesses. These will employ large numbers of workers, add considerably to economic growth, and will take the place of declining businesses that may be forced to close due to changing consumer tastes or technology. So, in Trinidad and Tobago, the relative decline of the sugar industry has been balanced out by the growth of the tourist industry, which has itself been boosted by small guesthouse businesses operating as sole traders.\n\n@@@Innovation and Technological Change\nNew businesses tend to be innovative and this creativity adds dynamism to an economy. This creativity can rub off onto other businesses and help to make the nation\u2019s business sector more competitive. Many new business start-ups are in the technology sector, e.g., website design. The increased use of IT by these firms, and the IT services they provide to other businesses, can help a nation\u2019s business sector become more advanced in its applications of IT, and therefore more competitive.\n\n@@@Exports\nMost business start-ups tend to offer goods and services that meet the needs of local or regional markets. Some will expand their operations to the export market, however, and this will increase the value of a nation\u2019s exports and improve its international competitiveness.\n\n@@@Personal Development\nStarting and managing a successful business can aid in the development of useful skills and help an individual towards self-actualization \u2013 a real sense of achievement. This can create an excellent example for others to follow and can lead to further successful new enterprises that will boost the economy still further.\n\n@@@Increased Social Cohesion\nUnemployment often leads to serious social problems and these can be much reduced if there is a successful and expanding small business sector. By creating jobs and career opportunities and by setting a good example for others to follow, entrepreneurship can help to achieve social cohesion in the country.\n\n@@@Top Tip for Applying Knowledge to a Local Context\nSome questions may ask you to make references to businesses 'in your own country'. You are advised to take a close interest during the Business course in the activities of businesses \u2013 new and well-established ones \u2013 in your country.\n\n@@@Understanding Social Enterprise\nSocial enterprises are not charities but do have objectives often different from those of an entrepreneur who is only profit motivated. A social enterprise is a business with mainly social objectives that reinvests most of its profits into benefiting society rather than maximizing returns to owners. Social enterprise is a proper business that makes its money in socially responsible ways and uses most of any surplus made to benefit society. Social entrepreneurs are not running a charity, however \u2013 they can and often do keep some of any profit they have made. Social enterprises compete with other businesses in the same market or industry. They use business principles to achieve social objectives. Most social enterprises have these common features: they directly produce goods or provide services, have social aims and use ethical ways of achieving them, and need to make a surplus or profit to survive as they cannot rely on donations as charities do.\n\n@@@Social Enterprise \u2013 Objectives and the Triple Bottom Line\nSocial enterprises often have three main aims. These are economic \u2013 make a profit to reinvest back into the business and provide some return to owners; social \u2013 provide jobs or support for local, often disadvantaged, communities; and environmental \u2013 to protect the environment and to manage the business in an environmentally sustainable way. These aims are often referred to as the triple bottom line, which means that profit is not the sole objective of these enterprises.\n\n@@@Research Activity on Social Enterprise\nResearch a social enterprise business in your own country. Try to find out what its social and environmental objectives are, how it is different from a charity, and how it is different from a traditional profit-only business. Write a report on your findings.\n\n@@@Example of a Social Enterprise\nExample 1: SELCO in India. This social enterprise provides sustainable energy solutions to low-income households and small businesses. In one scheme, solar-powered lighting was provided by SELCO to a silkworm farmer who depended on dangerous and polluting kerosene lamps. The farmer could not afford the upfront cost, so SELCO helped with the finance, too.","19":"@@@Chapter Overview and Learning Objectives\nThis chapter covers syllabus section AS Level 1.3. On completing this chapter, you will be able to: identify several ways of measuring the size of businesses and evaluate each of them; analyse the beneficial impact that small firms can have on a country's economy; analyse advantages and disadvantages of small and large businesses; explain the difference between internal and external growth.\n\n@@@Comparing Indian Steel and Retail Industries: A Tale of Two Industries\nThe size of the average Indian steel plant compared to the size of the average Indian retail shop could not be more different. Steel plants employ thousands of workers, have millions of dollars of capital invested in advanced equipment and produce annual outputs valued in the millions as well. Tata, one of the largest steelmakers in the world, has recently grown by taking over European steel giant Corus.\n\nThe contrast with typical Indian retail outlets could not be greater. The small shopkeepers and street hawkers that presently account for more than 95% of Indian retail sales often employ just a few workers with little investment in modern technology. However, all this could be about to change. There is a growing trend of mergers and takeovers in the retail sector. Large retail groups, such as Reliance and Walmart, are becoming established. It is claimed that the market share of this organized sector will be 28% by 2017. A pressure group of small retailers, the National Movement for Retail Democracy, is organizing demonstrations to demand that big corporations leave the retail industry. Points to think about: Why do you think the average steel plant is much larger than the average shop? How could you compare the sizes of different businesses? Do you think consumers of steel, such as car makers, will benefit from a takeover of Corus by Tata? Do you think Indian consumers will benefit from increasing numbers of large retail shops owned by just a few large corporations?\n\n@@@Introduction to Business Size and Importance\nBusinesses vary in size from sole traders with no additional workers to huge multinational corporations employing hundreds of thousands of employees. Measuring the size of businesses is rather an inexact science, but efforts are still made so that comparisons can be made between them, and so that growth or contraction can be assessed over time. This information is of interest not only to the managers of a business but to investors and governments too. Small firms offer many benefits for the dynamism of an economy and often receive special assistance from governments. Even the world\u2019s greatest companies started off as very small firms, and the ways in which firms can expand and the impact of these forms of growth on stakeholders are the focus of the last section of this chapter.","20":"@@@Muscle Contraction and the Specialization of Muscle Cells\nMuscle cells are often seen as the spoiled children of biology due to their specialized nature and terminology. Instead of the term \"cell membrane\" that's common for other cells, muscle cells use \"sarcolemma.\" This underscores the unique nature and adaptations of muscle cells for their role in the body.\n\n@@@Muscles Act in Antagonistic Pairs\nSkeletal muscles, also known as striated, striped, or voluntary muscles, facilitate movement by attaching to bones via tendons, while ligaments connect bones to other bones. These muscles contract and relax to move bones at joints as they act in antagonistic pairs, providing the motive force necessary for motion by acting as levers against the incompressible bones of the skeleton. For instance, the biceps and triceps operate as an antagonistic pair controlling the movement of the lower arm: as the biceps contracts and the triceps relax, the arm bends at the elbow with the biceps as the agonist; conversely, when the triceps contracts and the biceps relax, the arm extends at the elbow with the triceps serving as the agonist.\n\n@@@Skeletal Muscle Composition and Structure\nSkeletal muscles consist of numerous long cells called muscle fibers, distinguished by a unique vocabulary reflecting their specialized structures. The sarcolemma (cell membrane), transverse (T) tubules (folds of the sarcolemma that spread electrical impulses), and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (an internal network releasing calcium ions necessary for contraction) are all part of a muscle fiber's anatomy. Moreover, muscle fibers contain numerous mitochondria for ATP production, are multinucleate, and possess myofibrils, which are long cylindrical organelles made of proteins that are highly specialized for contraction.\n\n@@@Topic 6B \u2014 Nervous Coordination\nThe text \"Topic 6B \u2014 Nervous Coordination\" seems to act as a title or introduction to a new section or topic that likely discusses the relationship between the nervous system and how it coordinates the functions and responses of the body, potentially including its role in muscle contraction and overall motor coordination.","21":"@@@Introduction to Nucleic Acids in Biological Molecules\nThese two pages are all about nucleic acids \u2014 DNA and RNA. These molecules are needed to build proteins, which are required for the cells in living organisms to function. They're right handy little things.\n\n@@@The Crucial Roles of DNA and RNA\nDNA and RNA Carry Important Information\nDNA and RNA are both types of nucleic acid. They're found in all living cells and they both carry information. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is used to store genetic information \u2014 that's all the instructions an organism needs to grow and develop from a fertilised egg to a fully grown adult. RNA (ribonucleic acid) is similar in structure to DNA. One of its main functions is to transfer genetic information from the DNA to the ribosomes. Ribosomes are the body's 'protein factories' \u2014 they read the RNA to make polypeptides (proteins) in a process called translation (see p. 85). Ribosomes themselves are made from RNA and proteins.\n\n@@@DNA and RNA Structural Components\nDNA and RNA are Polymers of Nucleotides\nA nucleotide is a type of biological molecule. It's made from a pentose sugar (that's a sugar with 5 carbon atoms), a nitrogen-containing organic base, and a phosphate group. Organic means that it contains carbon. Nucleotides are really important. For a start, they're the monomers (see p. 2) that make up DNA and RNA.\n\n@@@Distinctive Sugars in DNA and RNA\nThe Sugar in DNA is Called Deoxyribose\nThe pentose sugar in a DNA nucleotide is called deoxyribose. Each DNA nucleotide has the same sugar and a phosphate group. The base on each nucleotide can vary though. There are four possible bases \u2014 adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G).\n\nThe Sugar in RNA is Called Ribose\nRNA contains nucleotides with a ribose sugar (not deoxyribose). Like DNA, an RNA nucleotide also has a phosphate group and one of four different bases. In RNA though, uracil (U) replaces thymine as a base.\n\n@@@Mary's Perspective\nMary didn't care if it was ribose or deoxyribose, she just wanted her cuppa.\n\n@@@Subsection Title Adjustment\nTopic 7 B \u2014 More Biological Molecules\n(Note: It appears that the last line may be a header or title for another section similar to the first line, but due to the lack of context, it cannot be categorized clearly into a thematic subsection. It is listed as-is since it is a part of the original text provided.)","22":"@@@Understanding Limiting Factors in Photosynthesis\nWhile you might wish to conclude your study of photosynthesis, it is important to understand that certain optimum conditions are necessary for photosynthesis to occur effectively. These conditions can vary among plant species, but for most plants in temperate climates, such as those found in the UK, there are general conditions that may be considered ideal.\n\n@@@Optimal Conditions for Photosynthesis in Most Plant Species\n1. High light intensity at specific wavelengths is crucial since light provides the energy needed for the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. Photosynthetic pigments like chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotene absorb mainly red and blue wavelengths, while green light is mostly reflected, giving plants their characteristic green color. 2. The temperature should ideally be around 25 \u00b0C for the efficient functioning of photosynthesis-related enzymes like ATP synthase and rubisco. Below 10 \u00b0C, these enzymes become less active, while temperatures above 45 \u00b0C can lead to their denaturation. Additionally, higher temperatures can cause stomata to close, reducing CO2 intake and slowing photosynthesis. 3. Maintaining carbon dioxide at 0.4% is beneficial, increasing it from the normal atmospheric level of 0.04% can enhance photosynthesis rates. However, raising it too much can again lead to stomatal closure. A constant supply of water is also essential, as a shortage can halt photosynthesis, while an excess may waterlog the soil, affecting mineral uptake necessary for chlorophyll production.\n\n@@@Light, Temperature, and CO2 as Factors Influencing Photosynthesis Rate\nEach of these three factors \u2014 light, temperature, and CO2 \u2014 needs to be within a certain range for photosynthesis to occur at maximum speed. Any deviation from these optimal levels can limit the process, regardless of the adequacy of the other conditions. CO2 is frequently the limiting factor on a calm sunny day, while during the night, light intensity is the main constraint. However, based on environmental circumstances, any of these elements can become the limiting point.\n\n@@@Interpreting Photosynthesis Limitations through Graphical Data\nThe relationship between these factors and the rate of photosynthesis can be demonstrated using graphs. Between points A and B on a light intensity graph, photosynthesis is light-limited; beyond point B, even though light intensity may increase, the rate of photosynthesis does not, indicating another factor has become the limitation. Temperature can also be a limiting factor, as shown by the comparison of graphs at different temperatures. Additionally, CO2 concentration affects the rate of photosynthesis, with levels off in graphs illustrating an increase in CO2 resulting in higher photosynthesis rates up to a point, beyond which it is no longer the limiting factor.\n\n@@@Summary of Photosynthesis' Dependency on Environmental Factors\nIn conclusion, the rate of photosynthesis is highly dependent on the external conditions, with a saturation point where a particular factor ceases to limit the reaction, allowing another factor to become the new limitation. These interactions highlight the complex balance plants must maintain to optimize photosynthesis within their specific environments. This summary falls under Topic 5 A \u2014 Photosynthesis and Respiration, underscoring the connection between photosynthesis, plant respiration, and environmental factors.","23":"@@@SPECIFICATION REFERENCE FOR LIPIDS\nThe lipids are another group of organic substances that play a vital role in organisms. They are an integral part of all cell membranes and are also used as an energy store. Lipids contain many carbon\u2013hydrogen bonds and almost no oxygen. When lipids are oxidised in the respiration process, the bonds are broken and carbon dioxide and water are the final products. This reaction can be used to drive the production of much ATP (see Sections 1A.3, 2A.2 and 2A.4 and Book 2 Chapter 5A). Lipids, especially triglycerides, store about three times as much energy as the same mass of carbohydrates. Many plants and animals convert spare food into oils or fats as an energy store to use when needed. For example, the seeds of plants contain lipids to provide energy for the seedling when it starts to grow, which is why seeds are such an important food source for many animals.\n\n@@@FEATURES AND IMPORTANCE OF FATS AND OILS\nFats and oils are important groups of lipids. Chemically they are very similar, but fats such as butter are solids at room temperature whereas oils such as olive oil are liquids (see fig A). Fats come mainly from animal sources while oils are mainly from plant sources. Like carbohydrates, the chemical elements that all lipid molecules contain are carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. However, lipids contain a much lower proportion of oxygen than carbohydrates. Fats and oils contain two types of organic chemical substance, fatty acids and glycerol (propane-1,2,3-triol). These are combined using ester bonds. Glycerol has the chemical formula C3H8O3 (see fig B).\n\n@@@VARIETIES OF FATTY ACIDS\nAll fatty acids have a long hydrocarbon chain \u2013 a folded backbone of carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms attached, and a carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) at one end. Living tissues contain more than 70 different types of fatty acid. Fatty acids vary in two ways: the length of the carbon chain can differ (but is often 15\u201317 carbon atoms long), and the fatty acid may be a saturated fatty acid or an unsaturated fatty acid. In a saturated fatty acid, each carbon atom is joined to the one next to it by a single covalent bond. A common example is stearic acid (see fig C). In an unsaturated fatty acid, the carbon chains have one or more double covalent bonds between carbon atoms in them. A monounsaturated fatty acid has one carbon\u2013carbon double bond and a polyunsaturated fatty acid has more than one carbon\u2013carbon double bond (see fig D). Linoleic acid is an example of a polyunsaturated fatty acid. It is an essential fatty acid in our diet because we cannot make it from other substances.\n\n@@@STRUCTURAL FORMULAS AND DIETARY INFORMATION\nCH3COOH (CH2)16CHHHHCHHCHHHHCCHHHHCCHHHHCCHHHHCCHHHHCCHHHHCCHHHHCCHHHHCCOHHHCO\u25b2 fig C Displayed formula of stearic acid, a saturated fatty acid found in both plant and animal fatsCHHHHCHHCHHHHCCHHHCCHHHCC carbon\u2013carbon double bondHHHCCHHHHCCHHHHCCHHHHCCOHHHC0\u25b2 fig D Displayed formula of linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acidHHHCHCHOH OH OH C\u25b2 fig B Displayed formula of glycerol (propane-1,2,3-triol).\n\n@@@LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n\u25fc Know how a triglyceride is synthesized by the formation of ester bonds during condensation reactions between glycerol and three fatty acids.\n\u25fc Describe the differences between unsaturated and saturated fatty acids.\n\u25b2 fig A Olive oil comes from pressed olives and is widely used for food and cooking around the world.1.5(ii) 1.5(i)\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

A lot of that evidence is used by governments and health organisations to produce advice on how to improve our health. Why do they do this?\n\n@@@PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE\nCardiovascular disease has a negative effect on individuals, on families and on society. It costs a lot of money to treat people in hospital. When people are too ill to work, they are losing money for their families, and also for the companies where they work. Treating people with drugs to prevent them from needing surgery is cheaper for health service providers. It is even cheaper (and better for the individual) if we can stop ourselves needing the drugs. So, prevention is better than treatment for CVDs for many reasons (see fig A). However, persuading people to change their lifestyle habits is often difficult.\nFor example, there is a lot of reliable evidence to show that smoking is one of the highest risk factors for CVDs. However, if you stop smoking, your risk of developing heart disease is almost halved after just one year. Moreover, research carried out by a team led by Azra Mahmud from Trinity College Dublin and published in 2007 suggests that after 10 years, the arteries of smokers who stop smoking are the same as if they had never smoked. There is a lot of support available for people who want to stop smoking. Yet, despite all this, almost 1 billion people around the world smoke cigarettes and millions of them die each year of CVDs and cancers linked to their smoking.\nHealth education programmes in schools and communities can help to make sure that everyone is aware of the risks associated with different lifestyle choices. However, each individual has to make their own choices and take their own risks.\n\n@@@OVERWEIGHT OR UNDERFIT?\nMost people are aware that obesity is linked to CVDs, and many go on slimming diets to try to lose weight. Most people also know that taking regular exercise helps protect against CVDs \u2013 but more people choose to go on a diet than choose to take regular exercise. The results of a study carried out over an average of eight years on 20,000 men aged from 30 to 83 years are given in Section 1C.4 fig B. Fitness was defined by how much oxygen they used during exercise. The results show that if you are obese and fit you have a lower risk of dying from CVDs than someone who is not obese but unfit. Obviously, being the correct weight and fit is best of all!\nThe problem is that many people enjoy their food, and don\u2019t take sufficient exercise. It takes a lot of effort to cut down the amount of food you eat and change to eating healthier foods including lots of fruit and vegetables. \u25b2\n\n@@@USING VISUAL AIDS FOR HEALTH EDUCATION\nfig A Infographics like this one published in Gulf News help people understand the factors which affect their heart health.\n\n@@@LEARNING TIP FOR STUDENTS\nRemember to read all the information in graphics.

These cells require a supply of chemical substances such as glucose and oxygen for cellular respiration. These must be transported from outside a large organism into the cells. Respiration supplies energy for the other reactions of life, but it also produces the toxic waste product carbon dioxide. This and other waste products need to be removed from the cells before they cause damage to them. Large multicellular organisms have internal transport systems that carry substances to every cell in the body. These systems deliver oxygen and nutrients and remove waste so that cells can carry out their functions efficiently. In large complex animals such as humans, chemicals made in a cell in one part of the body \u2013 such as a hormone like insulin or adrenaline \u2013 may influence a different type of cell elsewhere in the body. So substances made internally need to be moved around the body as well.\nIn many animals, including all the vertebrates, this transport system is the heart and circulatory system and the fluid that flows through it. This is an example of a mass transport system \u2013 substances are transported in the flow of a fluid with a mechanism for moving it around the body. All large complex organisms have some form of mass transport system which overcomes the limits of diffusion between the internal and external environments. Substances are delivered over short distances from the mass transport system to individual cells deep in the body by processes such as diffusion, osmosis and active transport.\n\n@@@FEATURES OF MASS TRANSPORT SYSTEMS\nMass transport systems are very effective for moving substances around the body. Most mass transport systems have certain features which are the same. They have: \n\u2022 exchange surfaces to get materials into and out of the transport system\n\u2022 a system of vessels that carry substances \u2013 these are usually tubes, sometimes following a very specific route, sometimes widespread and branching\n\u2022 a way of making sure that substances are moved in the right direction (e.g. nutrients in and waste out)\n\u2022 a way of moving materials fast enough to supply the needs of the organism \u2013 this may involve mechanical methods such as the pumping of the heart or ways of maintaining a concentration gradient so that substances move quickly from one place to another (e.g. using active transport)\n\u2022 a suitable transport medium (e.g. fluid)\n\u2022 in many cases, a way of adapting the rate of transport to the needs of the organism.\n\n@@@CIRCULATION SYSTEMS AND THEIR ADVANTAGES\nMany animals have a circulatory system in which a heart pumps blood around the body. Insects have an open circulatory system with the blood circulating in large open spaces. However, most larger animals, including mammals, have a closed circulatory system with the blood contained within tubes. The blood makes a continuous journey out to the most distant parts of the body and back to the heart. The main advantages of a closed system are:\n\u2022 the pressure can be increased to make the blood flow more quickly\n\u2022 the flow can be directed more precisely to the organs that need most oxygen and nutrients.\nAnimals such as fish have a single circulation system (see fig C). The heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the gills, the organs of gas exchange where the blood takes in oxygen (becomes oxygenated) and gives up carbon dioxide at the same time. The blood then travels on around the rest of the body of the fish, giving up oxygen to the body cells before returning to the heart.\n\n@@@EFFECTIVENESS OF MASS FLOW AND DOUBLE CIRCULATION IN BIRDS AND MAMMALS\nRemember that mass flow is like a stream with all the components flowing together. Birds and mammals need much more oxygen than fish. Not only do they have to move around without the support of water, but they also maintain a constant body temperature that may be higher or lower than their surroundings. This takes a lot of resources, so their cells need plenty of oxygen and glucose and make waste products that need to be removed quickly. Birds and mammals have evolved the most complex type of transport system, known as a double circulation because it involves two separate circulation systems. The systemic circulation carries oxygenated blood (oxygen-rich blood) from the heart to the cells of the body where the oxygen is used. It also carries the deoxygenated blood (blood that has given up its oxygen to the body cells) back to the heart. The pulmonary circulation carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs to be oxygenated and then carries the oxygenated blood back to the heart (see fig D).\nThe separate circuits of a double circulatory system ensure that the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood cannot mix, so the tissues receive as much oxygen as possible. Another big advantage is that the fully oxygenated blood can be delivered quickly to the body tissues at high pressure. The blood going through the tiny blood vessels in the lungs is at relatively low pressure, so it does not damage the delicate tissues there.\n\nPlease note that the text indicates this is an \"Uncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Among these, prokaryotes are a category of bacteria characterized by being single-celled, lacking a nucleus to contain their DNA, and smaller than their eukaryotic counterparts. Bacterial cells typically range from 1 \u00b5m to 10 \u00b5m in length, with one millimetre comprising a thousand micrometres. Consequently, from 100 to 1000 bacterial cells could theoretically align within a 1 mm straight line. Colonies, which are clusters of bacterial cells, can be seen in Figure 1.2. The evolutionary timeline indicates that prokaryotes emerged significantly earlier than eukaryotes, possibly around 3.5 billion years ago, soon after the Earth's crust formed. This assumption leads many scientists to deduce that eukaryotes may have evolved more complex cell components lacking in prokaryotes.\n\n@@@Understanding Timescales of Evolutionary Events\nA fascinating perspective on evolution is provided by compressing the Earth\u2019s 4.6 billion-year history into a span of one hour. As demonstrated in Figure 1.3, prokaryotic organisms emerged in the early minutes, followed by eukaryotes much later, and eventually, humans arrive in the closing seconds. This comparison gives a sense of the briefness of human existence relative to the Earth's history. It also emphasizes the importance of understanding the varying scales of cell types and their chronological place in evolution. \n\n@@@Key Definitions and Visualization of a Prokaryotic Cell\nKey terms are defined to aid understanding: 'Prokaryotic cells' are identified as cells without a nucleus, essentially bacterial cells. The term 'Prokaryote' then refers to a prokaryotic organism, such as a bacterial cell. Additionally, for visual learners, Figure 1.4 provides a microscopic view of a bacterial cell, magnified 20,000 times, alongside three- and two-dimensional representations, helping to contextualize the components such as plasmid DNA, single DNA loop, cell wall, ribosomes, flagella, cytoplasm, and cell surface membrane within a bacterial cell.","27":"@@@Introduction to Investigating Mitosis\nIt's time to dust off your lab coat and get out your safety specs. Here are all the techniques you need to study mitosis. You'll need to know how to stain root cells on slides and how to use an optical microscope and graticules.\n\n@@@Preparing and Observing Mitosis in Root Tips\nRoot Tips Can be Stained and Squashed to Observe Mitosis\nYou need to know how to prepare and stain a root tip in order to observe the stages of mitosis. Make sure you're wearing safety goggles and a lab coat before you start. You should also wear gloves when using stains. Cut 1 cm from the tip from a growing root (e.g. of an onion). It needs to be the tip because that's where growth occurs (and so that's where mitosis takes place). If you're using ethano-orcein to stain the cells, the tips will also need to be fixed in ethanoic acid. Prepare a boiling tube containing 1 M hydrochloric acid and put it in a water bath at 60 \u00b0C. Transfer the root tip into the boiling tube and incubate for about 5 minutes. Use a pipette to rinse the root tip well with cold water. Leave the tip to dry on a paper towel. Place the root tip on a microscope slide and cut 2 mm from the very tip of it. Get rid of the rest. Use a mounted needle to break the tip open and spread the cells out thinly. Add a few drops of stain and leave it for a few minutes. The stain will make the chromosomes easier to see under a microscope. There are loads of different stains, all with crazy names (toluidine blue O, ethano-orcein, Feulgen stain...). If you're using the Feulgen stain, you'll need an extra rinse. Place a cover slip over the cells and push down firmly to squash the tissue. This will make the tissue thinner and allow light to pass through it. Don't smear the cover slip sideways (or you'll damage the chromosomes). Now you can look at all the stages of mitosis under an optical microscope (see below). You should see something that looks like the photograph on the right. You need to be able to recognise cells in the different stages of mitosis \u2014 see p. 32 for more info.\n\n@@@Using the Optical Microscope to Observe Cells\nYou Can Observe Cells Using an Optical Microscope\nYou need to know how to use an optical microscope to observe your prepared root tip cells: Start by clipping the slide you've prepared onto the stage. Select the lowest-powered objective lens (i.e. the one that produces the lowest magnification). Use the coarse adjustment knob to bring the stage up to just below the objective lens. Look down the eyepiece (which contains the ocular lens). Use the coarse adjustment knob to move the stage downwards, away from the objective lens until the image is roughly in focus. Adjust the focus with the fine adjustment knob until you get a clear image of what's on the slide. If you need to see the slide with greater magnification, swap to a higher-powered objective lens and refocus. If you're asked to draw cells undergoing mitosis under the microscope, make sure you write down the magnification the specimen was viewed under. You'll also need to label your drawing.\n\n@@@Measuring Tissue Growth Through Mitotic Index\nThe Mitotic Index Is the Proportion of Cells Undergoing Mitosis\nYou can calculate the mitotic index of your cells using this formula: mitotic index = number of cells with visible chromosomes \/ total number of cells observed. This lets you work out how quickly the tissue is growing and if there's anything weird going on. A plant root tip is constantly growing, so you'd expect a high mitotic index (i.e. lots of cells in mitosis). In other tissue samples, a high mitotic index could mean that tissue repair is taking place or that there is cancerous growth in the tissue.

The learning objectives are to understand why people's perception of risks is often different from the actual risks, including underestimating and overestimating the risks due to diet and other lifestyle factors in the development of heart disease, and to be able to distinguish between correlation and causation. In every country, diseases can affect people randomly, but many non-communicable conditions such as heart disease and cancer can have their risks increased or lowered by lifestyle factors. Understanding the risk factors can help to make oneself and one's family healthier.\n\n@@@UNDERSTANDING RISK\nRisk in everyday conversation is different from its scientific meaning, which describes the probability that an event will happen - the chance or likelihood calculated mathematically. For example, with six colored balls in a bag, the probability of drawing a green ball is 1 in 6, 0.166 recurring, or 17%. This method can also determine the risk of developing certain diseases or dying from a specified cause.\n\n@@@PERCEPTION OF RISK VERSUS ACTUAL RISK\nPeople's perception of risk can significantly differ from the actual mathematical risk. Many don't think twice about driving despite a global annual risk of 1 in 5747 of being killed in a road traffic accident, while the much lower risk of a commercial flight crash is often overestimated. Personal perception is influenced by familiarity, enjoyment, and approval of the activity more than the mathematical risk. People often underestimate risks associated with behaviors they enjoy and exaggerate risks of activities they disapprove of or want to avoid, such as overemphasizing risks to keep children safe or minimizing the health risks of obesity despite strong evidence linking it to several diseases.\n\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Receptors are specific to one kind of stimulus. 1) Receptors are specific \u2014 they only detect one particular stimulus, e.g., light, pressure, or glucose concentration. 2) There are many different types of receptor that each detect a different type of stimulus. 3) Some receptors are cells, e.g. photoreceptors are receptor cells that connect to the nervous system. Some receptors are proteins on cell surface membranes, e.g., glucose receptors are proteins found in the cell membranes of some pancreatic cells. 4) Here's a bit more about how receptor cells that communicate information via the nervous system work: \u2022 When a nervous system receptor is in its resting state (not being stimulated), there's a difference in charge between the inside and the outside of the cell \u2014 this is generated by ion pumps and ion channels (see p. 136). This means that there's a voltage across the membrane. Voltage is also known as potential difference. \u2022 The potential difference when a cell is at rest is called its resting potential. When a stimulus is detected, the cell membrane is excited and becomes more permeable, allowing more ions to move in and out of the cell \u2014 altering the potential difference. The change in potential difference due to a stimulus is called the generator potential. \u2022 A bigger stimulus excites the membrane more, causing a bigger movement of ions and a bigger change in potential difference \u2014 so a bigger generator potential is produced. \u2022 If the generator potential is big enough, it'll trigger an action potential \u2014 an electrical impulse along a neurone (see pages 136-137). An action potential is only triggered if the generator potential reaches a certain level called the threshold level. Action potentials are all one size, so the strength of the stimulus is measured by the frequency of action potentials (the number of action potentials triggered during a certain time period). \u2022 If the stimulus is too weak, the generator potential won't reach the threshold, so there's no action potential.\n\n@@@Pacinian Corpuscles: Pressure Receptors in Your Skin\nPacinian corpuscles are mechanoreceptors \u2014 they detect mechanical stimuli, e.g., pressure and vibrations; they're found in your skin. 1) Pacinian corpuscles are mechanoreceptors \u2014 they detect mechanical stimuli, e.g., pressure and vibrations. They're found in your skin. 2) Pacinian corpuscles contain the end of a sensory neurone, imaginatively called a sensory nerve ending. The sensory nerve ending is wrapped in loads of layers of connective tissue called lamellae. 3) When a Pacinian corpuscle is stimulated, e.g., by a tap on the arm, the lamellae are deformed and press on the sensory nerve ending. A) This causes the sensory neurone's cell membrane to stretch, deforming the stretch-mediated sodium ion channels. The channels open and sodium ions diffuse into the cell, creating a generator potential. 5) If the generator potential reaches the threshold, it triggers an action potential. Pacinian corpuscles only respond to mechanical stimuli; this is a good example of how receptors only respond to specific stimuli.\n\n@@@Photoreceptors: Light Receptors in Your Eye\nPhotoreceptors are light receptors in your eye. 1) Light enters the eye through the pupil. The amount of light that enters is controlled by the muscles of the iris. 2) Light rays are focused by the lens onto the retina, which lines the inside of the eye. The retina contains photoreceptor cells \u2014 these detect light. 3) The fovea is an area of the retina where there are lots of photoreceptor cells. 4) Nerve impulses from the photoreceptor cells are carried from the retina to the brain by the optic nerve, which is a bundle of neurones. Where the optic nerve leaves the eye is called the blind spot \u2014 there aren't any photoreceptor cells, so it's not sensitive to light. \n\n@@@Topic 6A \u2014 Stimuli and Responses\nThe concept of receptors, their specificity, and their role in detecting and responding to various stimuli form the essence of Topic 6A \u2014 Stimuli and Responses in biological study.","30":"@@@ Introduction to Protein Chemistry for Biologists\n17 1A.5 PROTEINS CHEMISTRY FOR BIOLOGISTS presents an overview of hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds, and ionic bonds, which are essential in the structure and functionality of proteins. Each bond type plays a distinct role in maintaining the shape of protein molecules, determining their function, and contributing to protein stability. Furthermore, the text elaborates on the hair protein, keratin, and how different styling methods affect protein bonds. It introduces the concept of protein structure levels, including primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, by explaining how they relate to the overall protein configuration and the impact of temperature and pH on stability.\n\n@@@ The Importance of Hydrogen Bonds in Protein Structure\nHYDROGEN BONDS are critical to protein structures. In amino acids, oxygen atoms of carboxyl groups bear tiny negative charges, while hydrogen atoms of amino groups have tiny positive charges. When they are in proximity, they attract each other and form hydrogen bonds, which are relatively weak but abundant. Such bonds play a crucial role in the folding and coiling of polypeptide chains and are sensitive to pH and temperature changes, shown in figure C.\n\n@@@ The Role of Disulfide Bonds in Protein Stability\nDISULFIDE BONDS, which occur when two cysteine molecules are near one another within a polypeptide, result from an oxidation reaction that creates a strong covalent bond. These bonds are less frequent but much stronger than hydrogen bonds, crucially maintaining the folded state of polypeptide chains. Details of these interactions are also depicted in figure C.\n\n@@@ The Contribution of Ionic Bonds to Protein Integrity\nIONIC BONDS emerge between strongly charged amino acid side chains within protein molecules. Though not as widespread as other structural bonds, ionic bonds are robust and contribute significantly to maintaining protein integrity.\n\n@@@ Hair Proteins and the Impact of Styling Practices\nThe protein keratin, which makes up your hair, can undergo changes due to various styling methods. Blow drying or hair straightening alters hydrogen bonds, letting hair assume different shapes until the bonds restore their initial configuration. In contrast, chemical treatments like perming break and rearrange disulfide bonds, inducing long-term hair styling effects that persist until the hair is trimmed.\n\n@@@ Understanding Protein Structure Levels\nProteins possess various levels of structure. The PRIMARY STRUCTURE is the amino acid sequence in the polypeptide chain, linked by peptide bonds. The SECONDARY STRUCTURE involves the polypeptide chain forming regular, repeating 3D structures like the \u03b1-helix or \u03b2-pleated sheet, mostly held together by hydrogen bonds. Fibrous proteins typically exhibit secondary structure, and it is worth noting that such proteins are generally more stable under varying temperatures and pH levels. These insights into protein structure provide a foundation for understanding protein conformation and stability, as emphasized in figure D and the LEARNING TIP.\n\n\u00a9Pearson 2018 notes that the content is an uncorrected proof and subject to change, highlighting that it should not be resold, circulated, or distributed in whole or in part.","31":"@@@Introduction to Business Responsibilities and Stakeholder Theory\nThe traditional view of business, often called 'the shareholder concept,' prioritizes the shareholders as the owners of the company and suggests that the firm has a legally binding duty to put their needs first, meaning taking actions and making decisions that will increase shareholder value. It is essential for the directors and managers, who owe their position to shareholders, to keep them satisfied. However, this perspective has evolved to consider not only the interests of the investors\/owners but also those of suppliers, employees, and customers. This broader approach, the 'stakeholder theory' or 'stakeholder concept,' proposes that businesses should also take into account other parties, such as local communities, the public, government, and pressure groups including environmental lobbyists when making business decisions.\n\n@@@Definition of Key Terms Related to Stakeholders\nStakeholders are defined as people or groups of people who can be affected by and therefore have an interest in any action by an organisation. The 'stakeholder concept' refers to the view that businesses and their managers have responsibilities to a wide range of groups, not just shareholders. Main business stakeholders, other than owners\/shareholders, include customers, suppliers, employees and their families, local communities, government and government agencies, special interest groups (e.g., pressure groups concerned with pollution or animal testing), and lenders. A crucial tip is not to confuse 'stakeholder' with 'shareholder,' with the former being a much broader term that encompasses many groups, including shareholders.\n\n@@@The Impact of Business Activities on Stakeholders\nBusiness activities and decisions can have a variety of effects on stakeholders, both positive and negative. It is rare for all stakeholders to be affected in the same way by a single business activity, and it's possible for one stakeholder group to experience both negative and positive effects from the same business decision. The text calls for an analysis of these effects, as well as an examination of the roles, rights, and responsibilities of these stakeholder groups, which are detailed in Table 5.1 and Table 5.2 (to be seen on page 54).\n\n@@@Assessment Questions and Activity on Responsibilities to Stakeholders\nReaders are then presented with assessment questions and an activity related to business decisions and their impact on stakeholders. The questions require analysis of the effects on stakeholder groups from examples in Table 5.2, as well as the creation of other business decision examples and their impacts on stakeholders. In Activity 5.1, there's a discussion about responsibilities to customers in a competitive international market. Key decisions about quality, design, durability, and customer service must keep customer objectives in mind, including the production of well-made, attractive goods at reasonable prices without resorting to illegal or unethical practices like exploiting vulnerable customers or using high-pressure sales tactics. Embracing these responsibilities yields benefits such as consumer loyalty, repeat purchases, positive word-of-mouth recommendations, and useful customer feedback which helps improve products and services.\n","32":"@@@Introduction to the Importance of Stem Cells\nStem cells \u2014 they're the daddy of all cells, the big cheese, the top dog, and the head honcho. And here's why...\n\n@@@Understanding Totipotent Stem Cells and Their Capabilities\nTotipotent Stem Cells are Able to Mature into Any Type of Body Cell\n1) Multicellular organisms are made up from many different cell types that are specialised for their function, e.g. liver cells, muscle cells, white blood cells.\n2) All these specialised cell types originally came from stem cells.\n3) Stem cells are unspecialised cells that can develop into other types of cell.\n4) Stem cells divide to become new cells, which then become specialised.\n5) All multicellular organisms have some form of stem cell.\n6) Stem cells are found in the embryo (where they become all the specialised cells needed to form a fetus) and in some adult tissues (where they become specialised cells that need to be replaced, e.g. stem cells in the intestines constantly replace intestinal epithelial cells).\n7) Stem cells that can mature (develop) into any type of body cell in an organism, (including the cells that make up the placenta in mammals) are called totipotent cells.\n8) Totipotent stem cells are only present in mammals in the first few cell divisions of an embryo.\n9) After this point the embryonic stem cells become pluripotent. They can still specialise into any cell in the body, but lose the ability to become the cells that make up the placenta.\n10) The stem cells present in adult mammals are either:\n\u2022 Multipotent stem cells \u2014 These are able to differentiate into a few different types of cell. For example, both red and white blood cells can be formed from multipotent stem cells found in bone marrow.\n\u2022 Unipotent stem cells \u2014 These can only differentiate into one type of cell. For example, there's a type of unipotent stem cell that can only divide to produce epidermal skin cells, which make up the outer layer of your skin.\n\n@@@How Stem Cells Become Specialised Through Gene Expression\nStem Cells Become Specialised Because Different Genes are Expressed\nStem cells become specialised because during their development, they only transcribe and translate part of their DNA:\n1) Stem cells all contain the same genes \u2014 but during development, not all of them are transcribed and translated (expressed).\nRemember: transcription is when DNA is copied into mRNA. Translation is when proteins are produced using the code in mRNA.\n2) Under the right conditions, some genes are expressed and others are switched off.\n3) mRNA is only transcribed from specific genes.\n4) The mRNA from these genes is then translated into proteins.\n5) These proteins modify the cell \u2014 they determine the cell structure and control cell processes (including the expression of more genes, which produces more proteins).\n6) Changes to the cell produced by these proteins cause the cell to become specialised. These changes are difficult to reverse, so once a cell has specialised it stays specialised.\n\n[Example: Red Blood Cells]\n1) Red blood cells are produced from a type of stem cell in the bone marrow. They contain lots of haemoglobin and have no nucleus (to make room for more haemoglobin).\n2) The stem cell produces a new cell in which the genes for haemoglobin production are expressed. Other genes, such as those involved in removing the nucleus, are expressed too. Many other genes are not expressed (switched off), resulting in a specialised red blood cell.\n\n@@@Topic 8A \u2014 Mutations and Gene Expression\nThe concept of stem cells and their specialization is closely related to mutations and gene expression, which are covered under Topic 8A. Understanding how gene expression contributes to stem cell differentiation is crucial for comprehending the fundamental aspects of cellular mutations and the resultant variations in gene expression patterns.","33":"@@@Eukaryotic Cells and Organelles - Golgi Vesicle\nA small fluid-filled sac in the cytoplasm, surrounded by a membrane and produced by the Golgi apparatus.

It is widely applied to detect pathogenic infections and to identify allergies to substances such as nuts or lactose. Essentially, any substance that an antibody can be generated against can be tested using ELISA. The process involves using an antibody with an attached enzyme that reacts with a substrate, resulting in a detectable color change in the reaction vessel. This change indicates the presence of the target antigen or antibody. ELISA can be direct, using one type of antibody, or indirect, employing two types - a primary antibody that binds the antigen and a secondary antibody that binds the primary antibody and possesses the enzyme for color change. The intensity of the color can often be used to quantify the antigen or antibody levels.\n\n@@@Example of ELISA Use: HIV Testing Procedure\nELISA proves to be a critical tool in detecting HIV infections. By anchoring HIV antigen to a well, and then introducing a blood plasma sample, any present HIV-specific antibodies will bind to the antigen. Unbound antibodies are washed away, and a secondary antibody, carrying an enzyme, is added to bind any HIV-specific antibodies. After another wash to remove excess secondary antibodies, a substrate solution is introduced. Interaction with the enzyme causes a color change, revealing a positive result for HIV antibodies, and thus, HIV infection. This wash-and-detection protocol helps minimize false positives that could occur due to non-specific secondary antibody binding. Conversely, a lack of color change would indicate a negative result, reflecting the absence of HIV-specific antibodies.\n\n@@@Practice Questions and the Role of Monoclonal Antibodies\nMonoclonal antibodies have broad applications, including the capability to bind to other antibodies. This quality is particularly useful for medical interventions, such as treating asthma by targeting and neutralizing specific antibodies responsible for inflammatory responses in the lungs. By binding to these inflammation-causing antibodies, monoclonal antibodies can alleviate symptoms associated with asthma. Moreover, the text ends with a prompt to delve further into how monoclonal antibodies can be used to direct drugs to cancer cells, emphasizing their significant role as a 'multi-tool' within the immune system.\n\n@@@Highlighting Knowledge Areas: Cells and the Immune System\nThe concluding line serves as a bridge to the next topic in the series, which will presumably focus on cells and the immune system, possibly exploring further functionalities and intricacies of monoclonal antibodies and other components of the immune response.","35":"@@@SPECIFICATION REFERENCE AND LEARNING OBJECTIVES\nSPECIFICATION REFERENCE1 THE PRINCIPLES OF CIRCULATION 1B LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n \u25fcKnow why many animals have a heart and circulation which act as a mass transport system to overcome the limitations of diffusion.\n\n@@@THE NEED FOR TRANSPORT AND DIFFUSION\u2019S ROLE\nTHE NEED FOR TRANSPORT\n \u2022Within any organism, substances need to be moved from one place to another. One of the main ways substances move into and out of cells is by diffusion. Diffusion is the free movement of particles in a liquid or a gas down a concentration gradient. This movement is from an area where the particles are at a relatively high concentration to an area where they are at a relatively low concentration (see Section 2A.2). In single-celled organisms and microscopic multicellular organisms, diffusion is sufficient to supply all their needs. However, when organisms reach a certain size, diffusion alone is not enough.\n\n@@@HOW TRANSPORT WORKS IN SMALL ORGANISMS\nTRANSPORT IN SMALL ORGANISMS\nFor a single-celled organism like an amoeba and for very small multicellular organisms including many marine larvae, the nutrients and oxygen that they need can diffuse directly into the cells from the external environment and waste substances can diffuse directly out. This works well for the following reasons:\n \u2022The diffusion distances from the outside to the innermost areas of the cells are very small.\n \u2022The surface area in contact with the outside environment is very large when compared to the volume of the inside of the organism. Its surface area to volume ratio (sa:vol) is large, so there is a relatively big surface area over which substances can diffuse into or out of the organism (see figs A and B).\n \u2022The metabolic demands are low \u2013 the organisms do not regulate their own temperature and the cells do not use much oxygen and food or produce much carbon dioxide.\nSingle-celled organisms and very small multicellular organisms do not need specialised transport systems because diffusion is enough to supply their needs.\n\n@@@MODELLING SURFACE AREA TO VOLUME RATIOS\nMODELLING SURFACE AREA\u00a0:\u00a0VOLUME RATIOS\nThe surface area\u00a0to\u00a0volume ratio of an organism is the key factor that determines whether diffusion alone will allow substances to move into and out of all the cells rapidly enough. However, it is not easy to calculate the surface area\u00a0to\u00a0volume ratio of organisms such as elephants, people and palm trees. It is difficult even for a single-celled Amoeba because of its irregular shape.\nSo scientists use models to help show what happens in the real situation (see fig B). A simple cube makes surface area\u00a0to\u00a0volume calculations easy. The bigger the organism gets, the smaller the surface area\u00a0to\u00a0volume ratio becomes. The distance from the outside of the organism to the inside gets longer, and there is proportionately less surface for substances to enter through. So it takes longer for substances to diffuse in, and they may not reach the individual cells quickly enough to supply all their needs.\n\n@@@LEARNING TIP FOR SURFACE AREA TO VOLUME RATIOS\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that small organisms have a small surface area. But this surface area is large compared to the volume inside the organism, so it has a large surface area to volume ratio.\n\n@@@COPYRIGHT NOTICE\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

There are a few key terms vital to understanding biodiversity:\n\n1) **Biodiversity** is defined as the variety of living organisms within a particular area.\n2) A **Habitat** denotes the natural environment in which an organism resides, such as a rocky shore or a field.\n3) **Species** represent groups of similar organisms capable of interbreeding to produce fertile offspring, reflecting a shared genetic heritage.\n4) **Community** is the term for all populations of different species living and interacting within a habitat.\nIt's noted that areas with a large array of species are known to have high biodiversity, illustrating a rich assortment of life.\n\n@@@Scales of Biodiversity: Local to Global\nBiodiversity can be analyzed on various scales, from immediate local environments to the entire planet:\n\n1) **Local biodiversity** emphasizes the species variety within a small, localized habitat, such as a pond, meadow, or a backyard garden. The level of biodiversity can vary significantly across different habitats.\n2) **Global biodiversity** pertains to the collective variety of species on Earth, which recent estimates suggest might be around 8.7 million species. The distribution of biodiversity is not uniform; it generally peaks at the equator and tapers off toward the poles.\n\nComments on corporate policies suggest the integration of increased biodiversity might intersect with discussions about workplace productivity.\n\n@@@Measuring Biodiversity: Indices of Diversity\nThe assessment of biodiversity can be quantified using specific metrics:\n\n1) **Species richness** is the tally of distinct species present within a community. This count can be obtained through random sampling of a community and noting the number of different species identified.\n2) While a straightforward count of species, species richness alone does not fully capture biodiversity, as it does not account for the population sizes of those species, which could vary significantly.\n3) The **index of diversity** provides a more nuanced view by factoring in both species richness and the relative abundance of each species within a community.\n4) This index can be calculated using the formula: d = N(N - 1) \/ \u03a3[n(n - 1)], where N is the total number of organisms across all species, n is the number of individuals of a particular species, and \u03a3 represents summation.\n\nThe index accounts for species diversity, which considers both species richness and species abundance. The higher the calculated index value, the greater the area's biodiversity is recognized to be. In cases where only one species exists, the index value would be 1. An illustrative example is provided with calculations of species diversity in a field containing three species of flowers with a known number of individuals for each.\n\nWhen applying the index formula, it is necessary to calculate the n(n - 1) term for each species and then sum these values to obtain the denominator of the index equation.\n\n@@@Topic 4B: Diversity, Classification, and Variation\nThe text concludes with a reference to \"Topic 4B,\" which might relate to a larger framework or curriculum covering themes such as diversity, classification, and the variation among living organisms.

However, your body has systems to control your heart beat which speed it up or slow it down.\n\n@@@Cardiac Muscle Controls the Regular Beating of the Heart\nCardiac (heart) muscle is 'myogenic' \u2014 it can contract and relax without receiving signals from nerves. This pattern of contractions controls the regular heartbeat. The process starts in the sinoatrial node (SAN), which is in the wall of the right atrium. The SAN is like a pacemaker \u2014 it sets the rhythm of the heartbeat by sending out regular waves of electrical activity to the atrial walls. This causes the right and left atria to contract at the same time. A band of non-conducting collagen tissue prevents the waves of electrical activity from being passed directly from the atria to the ventricles. Instead, these waves of electrical activity are transferred from the SAN to the atrioventricular node (AVN). The AVN is responsible for passing the waves of electrical activity on to the bundle of His. But, there's a slight delay before the AVN reacts, to make sure the atria have emptied before the ventricles contract. The bundle of His is a group of muscle fibers responsible for conducting the waves of electrical activity between the ventricles to the apex (bottom) of the heart. The bundle splits into finer muscle fibers in the right and left ventricle walls, called the Purkyne tissue. The Purkyne tissue carries the waves of electrical activity into the muscular walls of the right and left ventricles, causing them to contract simultaneously, from the bottom up. waves of electrical Purkyne tissue\n\n@@@Control of Heart Rate Involves the Brain and Autonomic Nervous System\nThe sinoatrial node (SAN) generates electrical impulses that cause the cardiac muscles to contract. The rate at which the SAN fires (i.e. heart rate) is unconsciously controlled by a part of the brain called the medulla oblongata. Animals need to alter their heart rate to respond to internal stimuli, e.g., to prevent fainting due to low blood pressure or to make sure the heart rate is high enough to supply the body with enough oxygen. Stimuli are detected by pressure receptors and chemical receptors: There are pressure receptors called baroreceptors in the aorta and the carotid arteries (major arteries in the neck). They're stimulated by high and low blood pressure. There are chemical receptors called chemoreceptors in the aorta, the carotid arteries, and in the medulla. They monitor the oxygen level in the blood and also carbon dioxide and pH (which are indicators of blood oxygen level). Electrical impulses from receptors are sent to the medulla along sensory neurones. The medulla processes the information and sends impulses to the SAN along sympathetic or parasympathetic neurones (which are part of the autonomic nervous system).

Water's properties as a solvent allow a variety of substances to dissolve in it, which is essential since most metabolic reactions occur in solution, such as in the cytoplasm of cells. Furthermore, water assists in temperature regulation due to its high latent heat of vaporization and specific heat capacity. Finally, the cohesive nature of water molecules facilitates water transport in plants and other organisms. A metabolic reaction happens within a living organism to sustain life, with a metabolite being a substance involved in these reactions.\n\n@@@Structure of Water Molecules\n\nThe structure of water molecules is relatively simple. A single water molecule (H2O) consists of one oxygen atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms through shared electrons. The unequal sharing of electrons leads to a slight negative charge on the oxygen atom and a slight positive charge on the side of each hydrogen atom, which renders water a polar molecule. This polarity, characterized by a partial negative (\u03b4-) charge on one side and a partial positive (\u03b4+) charge on the other, results in the oxygen atoms of one water molecule being attracted to the hydrogen atoms of another. This attraction, known as hydrogen bonding, imbues water with its many beneficial properties.\n\n@@@Useful Properties of Water for Biological Systems\n\nWater isn't just a vital component of cells; it has several properties that are beneficial for living organisms. First off, water is a crucial metabolite in many reactions, including condensation reactions which join molecules together and release water, as well as hydrolysis reactions where water is used to break bonds, such as the formation and breakdown of polypeptides from amino acids, or the release of energy from ATP. Water's high latent heat of vaporization means a significant amount of energy is required to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules, which is advantageous for organisms as it allows for effective cooling through the evaporation of water without excessive water loss, a mechanism employed in processes like human sweating.","39":"@@@Introduction to Enzyme Action\nEnzymes crop up loads in biology \u2014 they're really useful 'cos they make reactions work quickly. So, whether you feel the need for some speed or not, read on \u2014 because you really need to know this basic stuff about enzymes.\n\n@@@The Role and Nature of Enzymes as Biological Catalysts\nEnzymes are Biological Catalysts. Enzymes speed up chemical reactions by acting as biological catalysts. A catalyst is a substance that speeds up a reaction without being used up in the reaction. Enzymes catalyse metabolic reactions \u2014 both at a cellular level (e.g., respiration) and for the organism as a whole (e.g., digestion in mammals). Enzymes can affect structures in an organism (e.g., enzymes are involved in the production of collagen, an important protein in the connective tissues of animals) as well as functions (like respiration). Enzyme action can be intracellular \u2014 within cells, or extracellular \u2014 outside cells. Enzymes are proteins (see previous page). Enzymes have an active site, which has a specific shape. The active site is the part of the enzyme where the substrate molecules (the substance that the enzyme interacts with) bind to. Enzymes are highly specific due to their tertiary structure (see next page).\n\n@@@How Enzymes Reduce Activation Energy\nEnzymes Lower the Activation Energy of a Reaction. In a chemical reaction, a certain amount of energy needs to be supplied to the chemicals before the reaction will start. This is called the activation energy \u2014 it's often provided as heat. Enzymes lower the amount of activation energy that's needed, often making reactions happen at a lower temperature than they could without an enzyme. This speeds up the rate of reaction. When a substrate fits into the enzyme's active site, it forms an enzyme-substrate complex \u2014 it's this that lowers the activation energy. Here are two reasons why: 1) If two substrate molecules need to be joined, being attached to the enzyme holds them close together, reducing any repulsion between the molecules so they can bond more easily. 2) If the enzyme is catalysing a breakdown reaction, fitting into the active site puts a strain on bonds in the substrate, so the substrate molecule breaks up more easily. The diagram shows how energy is released as the product is formed over time, comparing the chemical reaction without enzyme support and with enzyme support.\n\n@@@Evolution of Enzyme Models: From Lock and Key to Induced Fit\nThe \u2018Lock and Key\u2019 Model is a Good Start. Enzymes are a bit picky \u2014 they only work with substrates that fit their active site. Early scientists studying the action of enzymes came up with the 'lock and key' model. This is where the substrate fits into the enzyme in the same way that a key fits into a lock. However, this model was soon found to be incomplete. Scientists then recognized that the enzyme and substrate do have to fit together initially, but new evidence showed that the enzyme-substrate complex changed shape slightly to complete the fit, locking the substrate even more tightly to the enzyme. This led scientists to propose the 'induced fit' model, which better represents the dynamic nature of enzyme-substrate interactions.\n\n@@@Concluding Remarks on Biological Molecules\nTopic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules.","40":"@@@General Principles of Gas Exchange Adaptations \nLots of organisms have developed adaptations to improve their rate of gas exchange. It's a tricky business if you're an insect or a plant though \u2014 you've got to exchange enough gas but avoid losing all your water and drying to a crisp.\n\n@@@Key Features of Gas Exchange Surfaces\nMost gas exchange surfaces have two things in common:\n1) They have a large surface area. \n2) They're thin (often just one layer of epithelial cells)\u2014 this provides a short diffusion pathway across the gas exchange surface\nThe organism also maintains a steep concentration gradient of gases across the exchange surface.\nAll these features increase the rate of diffusion \u2014see page 39.\n\n@@@Single-Cell Gas Exchange\nSingle-celled Organisms Exchange Gases across their Body Surface\n1) Single-celled organisms absorb and release gases by diffusion through their outer surface. \n2) They have a relatively large surface area, a thin surface, and a short diffusion pathway (oxygen can take part in biochemical reactions as soon as it diffuses into the cell)\u2014 so there's no need for a gas exchange system.\n\n@@@Fish Gas Exchange Mechanisms\nFish Use a Counter-Current System for Gas Exchange\nThere's a lower concentration of oxygen in water than in air. So fish have special adaptations to get enough of it.\n1) Water, containing oxygen, enters the fish through its mouth and passes out through the gills. \n2) Each gill is made of lots of thin plates called gill filaments, which give a big surface area for exchange of gases. \n3) The gill filaments are covered in lots of tiny structures called lamellae, which increase the surface area even more. \n4) The lamellae have lots of blood capillaries and a thin surface layer of cells to speed up diffusion.\n5) Blood flows through the lamellae in one direction, and water flows over in the opposite direction. This is called a counter-current system. It maintains a large concentration gradient between the water and the blood. The concentration of oxygen in the water is always higher than that in the blood, so as much oxygen as possible diffuses from the water into the blood.\n\n@@@Insect Gas Exchange System\nInsects use Tracheae to Exchange Gases\n1) Insects have microscopic air-filled pipes called tracheae, which they use for gas exchange. \n2) Air moves into the tracheae through pores on the surface called spiracles. \n3) Oxygen travels down the concentration gradient towards the cells. \n4) The tracheae branch off into smaller tracheoles which have thin, permeable walls and go to individual cells. This means that oxygen diffuses directly into the respiring cells \u2014 the insect's circulatory system doesn't transport O2.\n5) Carbon dioxide from the cells moves down its own concentration gradient towards the spiracles to be released into the atmosphere. \n6) Insects use rhythmic abdominal movements to move air in and out of the spiracles.\n\n@@@Topic Overview \nTopic 3 A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems","41":"@@@Joint Ventures: Definition and Reasons for Collaboration\nJoint ventures are not to be confused with mergers; however, successful joint ventures can sometimes result in mergers if the businesses find their joint interests to be aligned. The motivations for entering joint ventures include shared costs and risks associated with new ventures, especially pertinent as development costs increase; the complementing strengths and experiences of different companies; and the ability to leverage distinct market presences in various countries when introducing new products, which may be less effective if companies chose to tackle the markets independently. A joint venture involves two or more businesses agreeing to collaborate closely on a specific project by setting up a separate business division expressly for this purpose.\n\n@@@Risks in Joint Ventures\nJoint ventures also carry their own risks. There can be challenges blending different management styles and corporate cultures, which can disrupt team cohesion. When mistakes occur, there can be a tendency for companies to assign blame to each other. Additionally, if one partner business fails, the entire joint venture project's success can become jeopardized.\n\n@@@Holding Companies: Ownership Without Total Unification\nHolding companies, while not forming a different legal structure for an organization, represent an increasingly common method of business ownership. A holding company owns and manages multiple separate businesses without unifying them into a singular entity. These subsidiary businesses may operate in various markets, allowing the holding company to hold diversified interests. While subsidiaries maintain independence in their major decision-making and policy changes, the holding company maintains the potential for centralized control over essential matters such as significant investments.\n\n@@@Public-Sector Enterprises \u2013 Public Corporations\nThe term 'public' is used in different contexts, which can lead to confusion. Public limited companies, despite the naming, are privately owned by shareholders and operate in the private sector of the economy. Conversely, public corporations are businesses that are owned and controlled by the state, existing within the public sector. Public-sector enterprises typically do not prioritize profit as a major objective, focusing instead on other priorities, such as program quality for state-owned television channels or safety for state-owned airlines. Further discussion on public corporations, including the implications of privatization and changing objectives when public entities are sold to the private sector, can be found in an analysis provided in the study material, including Table 2.7. \n\n*Additional content not included under a specific title speaks about the franchise model using McDonald's as an example, but it is not sufficiently developed in the provided text to warrant its own subsection.","42":"@@@POLYSACCHARIDES: COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES AND THEIR FORMATION\nThe most complex carbohydrates are the polysaccharides. They are made of many monosaccharide units joined by condensation reactions that create glycosidic bonds (see Section 1A.2 fig E). Polysaccharides do not have the sweet taste of many mono- and disaccharides, but these complex polymers include some very important biological molecules. Molecules with between 3 and 10 sugar units are known as oligosaccharides, while molecules containing 11 or more monosaccharides are known as true polysaccharides. The glycosidic bonds in the polysaccharide can be broken to release monosaccharide units for cellular respiration.\nThe glycosidic bond between two glucose units is split by a process known as hydrolysis (see fig A). The hydrolysis reaction is the opposite of the condensation reaction that created the molecule, so water is added to the bond. Starch and glycogen are gradually broken down into shorter and shorter chains and eventually single sugars are left. Disaccharides break down to form two monosaccharides. Hydrolysis takes place during digestion in the gut, and also in the muscle and liver cells when the carbohydrate stores are broken down to release sugars for use in cellular respiration (see Book 2 Chapter 7A). \u25b2 fig A Glycosidic bonds are made by condensation reactions and broken down by hydrolysis.\n\n@@@CARBOHYDRATES AND ENERGY: MONOSACCHARIDES AND DISACCHARIDES\nEvery chemical reaction taking place in a cell needs energy. This energy is supplied by a substance called adenosine triphosphate, ATP. This ATP comes from the breakdown of the monosaccharide glucose, using oxygen, in the process of cellular respiration. You will learn much more about cellular respiration later in your course in Book 2 Chapter 7A. The arrangement of atoms in a molecule of \u03b1-glucose means that it can be broken down completely in a series of reactions, if oxygen is available. The compounds that are produced, called the end products, are waste carbon dioxide and water, and lots of ATP. This supplies the energy needed for all the reactions in the cell. LEARNING TIP Glycosidic bonds are formed with the removal of a molecule of water in condensation reactions. Glycosidic bonds are broken with the addition of a molecule of water in hydrolysis reactions. EXAM HINT Be careful not to say that this produces or creates energy for cell processes. Energy cannot be created \u2013 it is converted from one form to another. Here, chemical energy is transferred from the glucose molecule to the ATP molecules. LEARNING OBJECTIVES \u25fcKnow the difference between monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides, including glycogen and starch. \u25fcExplain how monosaccharides join to form polysaccharides through condensation reactions forming glycosidic bonds, and how these can be split through hydrolysis reactions. \u25fcRelate the structures of monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides to their roles in providing and storing energy.1.4 CP1 1.3 1.2(ii) 1.2(i)\n\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Harsh I know. Before You Start Planning, Be Clear on What You\u2019re Trying to Find Out Like all scientists, you should start off by making a prediction or hypothesis \u2014 a specific testable statement, based on theory, about what will happen in the experiment. You then need to plan a good experiment that will provide evidence to support the prediction \u2014 or help disprove it.\n\n@@@Characteristics of a Good Experiment\nA Good Experiment Gives Results that are... Precise \u2014 precise results don't vary much from the mean. Precision is reduced by random error (the unpredictable way in which all measurements vary). Repeatable and reproducible \u2014 repeatable means that if the same person repeats the experiment using the same methods and equipment, they will get the same results. Reproducible means that if someone different does the experiment, using a slightly different method or piece of equipment, the results will still be the same. Valid \u2014 valid results answer the original question. To get valid results you need to control all the variables (see below) to make sure you're only testing the thing you want to. Accurate \u2014 accurate results are really close to the true answer. Human interpretation of a measurement (e.g. determining a colour change) can reduce the accuracy of results.\n\n@@@Designing a Good Experiment\nHere are some things you need to consider when designing a good experiment: Only one variable should be changed \u2014 Variables are quantities that have the potential to change, e.g. pH. In an experiment you usually change one variable and measure its effect on another variable. \u2022 The variable that you change is called the independent variable. \u2022 The variable that you measure is called the dependent variable. All the other variables should be controlled \u2014 When you're investigating a variable you need to keep everything else that could affect it constant. This means you can be sure that only your independent variable is affecting the thing you're measuring (the dependent variable). Negative controls should be used \u2014 Negative controls are used to check that only the independent variable is affecting the dependent variable. Negative controls aren't expected to have any effect on the experiment. Investigating the effect of light intensity on rate of photosynthesis of Canadian pondweed Light intensity is the independent variable. Rate of photosynthesis is the dependent variable. pH, temperature and the time the pondweed is left should all stay the same (and the quantities should be recorded to allow someone else to reproduce the experiment). The experiment should be repeated at least three times for each light intensity used. A negative control, in which the experiment is carried out in the dark, should also be used. No photosynthesis should happen with this control. The experiment should be repeated at least three times and a mean should be calculated \u2014 this reduces the effect of random error on your experiment, which makes your results more precise. Doing repeats and getting similar results each time also shows that your data is repeatable and makes it more likely to be reproducible. Examiners love getting you to comment on experimental design or suggest improvements to methods \u2014 e.g. how a method could be improved to make the results more precise. So make sure you know how to design a good experiment.\n\n@@@Selecting Appropriate Apparatus, Equipment, and Techniques\nSelect Appropriate Apparatus, Equipment and Techniques When you're planning an experiment you need to decide what it is you're going to measure and how often you're going to take measurements. E.g. if you're investigating the rate of respiration, you could either measure the volume of oxygen used over time or the volume of carbon dioxide produced over time. You could take measurements at, e.g. 30 second intervals or 60 second intervals. Then you need to choose the most appropriate apparatus, equipment and techniques for the experiment. E.g. \u2022 The measuring apparatus you use has to be sensitive enough to measure the changes you're looking for. For example, if you need to measure small changes in pH, a pH meter (which can measure pH to several decimal places) would be more sensitive than indicator paper. \u2022 The technique you use has to be the most appropriate one for your experiment. E.g. if you want to measure the concentration of glucose in an unknown solution, using a colorimeter in conjunction with quantitative Benedict's reagent (see page 151) will help you to get more accurate results than simply comparing the colour differences of the solutions by eye. Practical Skills","44":"@@@CIRCULATION IN THE BLOOD VESSELS\nThe arrangement of tissues in a vein reflects the pressure of blood in the vessel. There is a smooth inner surface, an outer tough layer consisting mainly of collagen fibers, a relatively thin layer of smooth muscle with few elastic fibers, and a relatively large lumen which distinguishes veins from arteries, as depicted in fig D. Only two veins, sometimes referred to as the great veins, are responsible for carrying the blood back to the heart from the body tissues \u2013 namely, the inferior vena cava, returning blood from the lower parts of the body, and the superior vena cava, from the upper parts. Veins are capable of holding a large volume of blood, in fact, more than half of the body's blood volume can be contained within the veins at any given moment, functioning as a blood reservoir. This is pertinent considering the blood pressure in veins is comparatively low, as the surges generated from the heart's pumping action are dampened before the blood traverses through the capillary network. The low-pressure blood must still be transported back to the heart and lungs for oxygenation and to be circulated again.\n\nBlood is not actively pumped in the return journey to the heart; instead, it relies on muscle contractions and the presence of one-way valves. Many of the larger veins are strategically located between significant muscle blocks in the body, like those in the arms and legs. During physical activity, the contraction of these muscles compresses the veins, and with the aid of the valves that only permit unidirectional flow, this compression effectively aids in returning the blood to the heart. These valves, scattered frequently throughout the venous system, are known as semilunar valves due to their half-moon shape and originate from the infoldings of the vein's inner wall. Blood can readily flow through these valves towards the heart, but should the blood attempt to reverse direction, the valves will close, preventing any potential backflow. fig E illustrates how these valves operate, ensuring that blood only flows toward the heart, with muscle contractions further aiding this movement.\n\nThe main types of blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and capillaries, exhibit distinct characteristics that influence the circulation of blood through the body and their particular functions within it. Some of these differences are succinctly demonstrated in fig F by a graph which delineates the surface area of each major blood vessel type alongside the blood's velocity and pressure within them. This reflects the interplay between vessel structure and the circulatory dynamics of blood flow.

The graph might be presented in your exam to interpret the release of a product over time. For instance, you could observe the volume of the product released by an enzyme-controlled reaction at different temperatures. Start by looking at the beginning of the graph and compare the rates of reaction there. For example, the reaction might be fastest at 65 \u00b0C, and you are expected to explain why, using your knowledge about factors affecting enzymatic activity. It may require working out the initial rate of reaction.\n\nFurther examine the graph to ascertain what it indicates, making comparisons between different temperatures. For instance, at 37 \u00b0C, the graph plateaus because all the substrate has been utilized. At 65 \u00b0C, it may plateau earlier than at 37 \u00b0C due to enzyme denaturation from the high temperature, indicating that the reaction stopped sooner. Here, not as much product was created because the enzyme denatured before all the substrate could be converted into product, so substrate remains. At 25 \u00b0C, with the rate of reaction constant and the volume of product still increasing, it's evident that not all substrate has been utilized yet.\n\n@@@Calculating the Initial Rate of Reaction Using Tangents\nTo determine the initial rate of reaction, which is the rate close to time zero on the graph, you can use a tangent. Begin by drawing a tangent at t = 0, positioning your ruler equidistant from the curve on either side of the point of contact, estimating where the curve would continue below zero. Draw a line along the ruler to establish this tangent. Calculating the gradient of the tangent gives you the initial rate of reaction. The formula for the gradient is change in y over change in x, which can be calculated from the graph. If comparing initial rates of reaction between two different experiments, work out the ratio of the rates for a quick evaluation.\n\n@@@Practice and Exam Questions on Enzyme Reactions\nIn practice, one question could be about drawing a tangent to determine the initial rate of reaction at a specific temperature and showing your workings. Additionally, you could be asked to consider the variables that must be kept constant when testing the effects of pH on enzyme activity. In an exam, questions might involve methods used to measure the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction or calculations from a graph. Investing time to memorize examples and understand the mathematics involved in these graphs is valuable for exams covering 'Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules'.","46":"@@@Introduction to Topic 4A: DNA, RNA, and Protein Synthesis\nDNA, RNA, and Protein Synthesis represent fundamental concepts in molecular biology. Topic 4 sheds light on the intricate details of DNA, genes, and chromosomes, exploring the humor in our genetic makeup while providing essential information on how DNA is packed, the nature and role of genes, and the synthesis process of proteins from these genetic instructions.\n\n@@@DNA Packaging in Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Cells\nAlthough the structure of DNA is consistent across organisms, the manner in which it is stored differs between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells, which include plant and animal cells, have linear DNA molecules organized into chromosomes within the nucleus. This DNA is wound around histone proteins to form a compact structure. The DNA within the mitochondria and chloroplasts of these cells is circular and not associated with histones, bearing resemblance to prokaryotic DNA. On the other hand, prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria, have shorter, circular DNA chromosomes that condense within the cell through supercoiling without the aid of histones.\n\n@@@The Concept of Genes Within DNA\nGenes are defined as sequences of DNA bases that code for specific polypeptides or functional RNA molecules. The order of amino acids in a protein's primary structure is determined by the base sequence within a gene, with each amino acid being coded for by a triplet of bases. DNA transcription into messenger RNA (mRNA) is the first step in protein synthesis. Some genes are responsible for coding functional RNA instead of polypeptides, such as transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which are essential in the process of protein synthesis. To encapsulate the totality of genetic information, a cell's genome and proteome refer respectively to the complete set of genes and the full spectrum of proteins it can produce.\n\n@@@Concluding Topic 4A\nTopic 4A serves as an overview of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, paving the way for a deeper understanding of genetic information and its role in biological functions. As genetics plays a crucial role in individual traits and capabilities, such as athletic prowess, this topic illustrates the multifaceted nature of biology and its impact on life.","47":"@@@Introduction to Nutrient Cycles in Ecosystems\nOrganisms don't need to worry about which recycling bin to use. Ecosystems have developed a much better system to make sure necessary elements like nitrogen and phosphorus can be recycled and don't run out.\n\n@@@The Role of Microorganisms in Nutrient Recycling\n1) A natural ecosystem is one that hasn't been changed by human activity. In natural ecosystems, nutrients are recycled through the food webs, but human activity often disrupts the cycling of nutrients.\n2) Microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, are an important part of food webs. Many are saprobionts (a type of decomposer) \u2014 they feed on the remains of dead plants and animals and on their waste products (faeces, urine), breaking them down. This allows important chemical elements in the remains to be recycled.\n3) Saprobionts secrete enzymes and digest their food externally, then absorb the nutrients they need. This is known as extracellular digestion. During this process, organic molecules are broken down into inorganic ions. Obtaining nutrients from dead organic matter using extracellular digestion is known as saprobiotic nutrition.\n4) Some fungi form symbiotic relationships with the roots of plants. These relationships are known as mycorrhizae. \n   \u2022 The fungi are made up of long, thin strands called hyphae, which connect to the plant's roots.\n   \u2022 The hyphae greatly increase the surface area of the plant's root system, helping the plant to absorb ions from the soil that are usually scarce (e.g. phosphorus). Hyphae also increase the uptake of water by the plant.\n   \u2022 In turn, the fungi obtain organic compounds, such as glucose, from the plant.\n\n@@@The Nitrogen Cycle: An Overview of Nitrogen Recycling in Ecosystems\nPlants and animals need nitrogen to make proteins and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). The atmosphere is made up of about 78% nitrogen gas, but plants and animals can't use it in that form \u2014 they need bacteria to convert it into nitrogen-containing compounds first. The nitrogen cycle shows how nitrogen is converted into a usable form and then passed on between different living organisms and the non-living environment.\n\n@@@Nitrogen Fixation: The Start of the Nitrogen Cycle\n(T) Nitrogen fixation\nAtmospheric nitrogen\nNitrogen compounds plants\nNitrogen fixation is when nitrogen gas in the atmosphere is turned into nitrogen-containing compounds. Biological nitrogen fixation is carried out by bacteria such as Rhizobium. They turn nitrogen into ammonia, which goes on to form ammonium ions in solution that can then be used by plants.\nRhizobium are found inside root nodules (growths on the roots) of leguminous plants (e.g. peas, beans, and clover).\nThey form a mutualistic relationship with the plants \u2014 they provide the plant with nitrogen compounds and the plant provides them with carbohydrates.\n\n@@@Ammonification: Converting Organic Nitrogen to a Simpler Form\n(NITROGEN FIXATION)\nNitrogen compounds in animals\nfAMMONIFICATION (by saprobionts)\nAmmonification is when nitrogen compounds from dead organisms are turned into ammonia by saprobionts, which goes on to form ammonium ions. Animal waste (urine and feces) also contains nitrogen compounds. These are also turned into ammonia by saprobionts and go on to form ammonium ions.\n\n@@@Nitrification: Preparing Nitrogen for Plant Uptake\n(T) Nitrification\nNitrification is when ammonium ions in the soil are changed into nitrogen compounds that can then be used by plants (nitrates). \nFirst nitrifying bacteria called Nitrosomonas change ammonium ions into nitrites.\nThen other nitrifying bacteria called Nitrobacter change nitrites into nitrates.\n\n@@@Denitrification: Returning Nitrogen to the Atmosphere\n(4) Denitrification\nDenitrification is when nitrates in the soil are converted into nitrogen gas by denitrifying bacteria \u2014 they use nitrates in the soil to carry out respiration and produce nitrogen gas.\nThis happens under anaerobic conditions (where there's no oxygen), e.g., in waterlogged soils.\nOther ways that nitrogen gets into an ecosystem are by lightning (which fixes atmospheric nitrogen) or by artificial fertilizers (they're produced from atmospheric nitrogen on an industrial scale in the Haber process).\n\n@@@Topic 5B \u2014 Energy Transfer and Nutrient Cycles\n \n\n","48":"@@@The Impact of Economic Recession on Businesses and Economies\nAn economic recession has serious consequences for most businesses and the whole economy. As output is falling, fewer workers will be needed. Unemployment will increase and as incomes fall, so demand for goods and services declines further. Government tax revenue will also fall as less income tax and sales revenue tax will be received. Firms producing \u2018normal\u2019 and income-elastic goods will experience reduced demand, which will leave them with spare capacity. Recession: a period of six months or more of declining real GDP.\n\n@@@Opportunities During a Recession for Well-Managed Firms\nHowever, there will also be opportunities that well-managed firms may be able to take advantage of (see Table 9.1). Capital assets, such as land and property and even other businesses, may be relatively cheap and firms could invest in expectation of an economic recovery. Demand for \u2018inferior\u2019 goods could actually increase. The risk of retrenchment and job losses may encourage improved relations between employers and employees, leading to increased efficiency. Hard decisions may need to be taken regarding closures of factories and offices \u2013 this could make the business \u2018leaner and fitter\u2019 and better able to take advantage of economic growth when this eventually starts again. As a Business student, you should think about how the stages of the business cycle will affect different businesses in different ways \u2013 and how businesses will respond to these stages with different strategies.\n\n@@@Understanding Inflation and Deflation and Their Effects on the Value of Money\nInflation and deflation \u2013 changes in the value of money. The spending power of one dollar is the goods that can be bought with that dollar. The spending power of money can change over time. If one dollar buys fewer goods this year than it did last year, then the value of money has fallen and this must have been caused by inflation. Inflation: an increase in the average price level of goods and services \u2013 it results in a fall in the value of money. If one dollar buys more goods this year than it did last year, then the value of money has increased. This must have been caused by deflation. Deflation: a fall in the average price level of goods and services.\n\n@@@How Business Strategy Adapts to Economic Conditions\nType of producer Period of economic growth Period of recession\nProducers of luxury goods and services \u2013 e.g. cars: increase the range of goods and services, raise prices to increase profit margins, promote exclusivity and style, increase output; may not reduce prices for fear of damaging long-term image, credit terms to improve affordability, offer promotions, widen product range with lower-priced models. Producers of normal goods and services \u2013 e.g. tinned food: add extra value to product \u2013 better ingredients\/improved packaging, brand image may attract exclusive tag, do nothing \u2013 sales not much affected anyway; lower prices, promotions, do nothing \u2013 sales not much affected anyway. Producers of inferior goods and services \u2013 e.g. very cheap clothing: attempt to move product upmarket, add extra value to the product \u2013 e.g. higher quality, extend the product range to include more exclusive or better-designed products; promote good value and low prices, free consumer tests, increase range of distribution outlets.

In agriculture, practices such as monoculture are worrying as they could potentially make the entire crop vulnerable to diseases since all plants are genetically identical. This also raises concerns about reduced biodiversity, which environmentalists believe could adversely affect the environment. The prospect of 'superweeds' developing from transformed crops breeding with wild plants sparks anxiety over an uncontrolled spread of recombinant DNA with uncertain outcomes. The issue extends to organic farmers who may experience wind-blown contamination from genetically modified (GM) crops, making it impossible to sell their produce under organic status, thus risking financial loss. In the industry realm, anti-globalization activists are against the rise of large multinational biotech companies overshadowing smaller entities, which may be driven out of the market. These dominant biotech firms could increase power with the spread of genetic engineering technology, while consumers could lose the choice to avoid genetically engineered foods due to inadequate labelling. Further economic implications are seen in regions like the EU, which rejects GM food imports, leading to production loss for traditional markets. \n\n@@@Concerns in Medicine and Intellectual Property\nWithin the medical industry, the monopoly of genetic engineering technologies by specific companies can hinder the accessibility of potentially life-saving technologies. Ethical dilemmas also arise concerning the misuse of this technology, such as creating 'designer babies', an illegal practice yet a concerning possibility. Recombinant DNA technology brings forward disputes over ownership rights, particularly regarding who owns human genetic material \u2013 the donor or the researcher utilizing it for medical advancements. Patents held by corporations on specific seeds prompt discussions on high pricing, technology fees, and the recurring costs to farmers who have to buy new seeds yearly. Legal conflicts may also arise if GM crops unintentionally contaminate non-GM crops, potentially leading to lawsuits against farmers for patent infringements.\n\n@@@Humanitarian Perspectives on Recombinant DNA Technology\nOn the more optimistic side, many believe Recombinant DNA technology holds a plethora of humanitarian benefits. In the agricultural sector, it offers a promise in the creation of crops that could curb the risks of famine and malnutrition, like developing drought-resistant varieties suitable for arid regions. There's also the potential to use transformed crops to produce pharmaceuticals, such as vaccines that could reach more populations, especially in locales where standard vaccine storage is problematic. Economically, the technology might enable the production of more affordable medicines, thereby improving access. Looking ahead, the capabilities of Recombinant DNA to treat human diseases through gene therapy are also in sight. Balancing these technologies with opposing views from environmentalists and anti-globalization activists is a task that presents both challenges and opportunities for future scientific and societal progress.","50":"@@@Populations and the Concept of a Gene Pool\n\nA species is defined as a group of similar organisms that can reproduce to give fertile offspring. A population, on the other hand, refers to a group of organisms of the same species living in a particular area at a particular time, which implies the potential for interbreeding amongst them. An example given is that of populations of the American black bear (Ursus americanus) which can be found in various regions across America and Canada. Within these populations is the concept of a gene pool, which represents the complete range of alleles present in a population. This is an important term because it underpins the understanding of allele frequency, which measures how often an allele occurs within a population, whether expressed as a percentage or a numerical value.\n\n@@@The Hardy-Weinberg Principle and Predicting Allele Frequencies\n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg principle is introduced as a mathematical model designed to predict the stable frequencies of alleles across generations in a population. The underlying assumption of this model mandates that the population is large with no influx or outflow of individuals (immigration or emigration), no mutations, no natural selection, and requires random mating amongst genotypes. The principle has practical applications as it provides equations that can be used to calculate the frequency of specific alleles, genotypes, and phenotypes within a population. Moreover, it serves as an investigatory tool to determine whether allele frequencies are being shaped by natural selection or other factors, given that any observable change in frequency could indicate external influences.\n\n@@@Application of the Hardy-Weinberg Equations\n\nTo predict allele frequencies, one can employ the Hardy-Weinberg equation which relates the frequency of one allele to another, with the understanding that all allele frequencies combined must total 1.0 in a population. The text provides an example using a species of plant with either red or white flowers to show how to calculate the frequency of the recessive allele if the dominant allele's frequency is known. This calculation is based on the principle's framework that the sum of the allele frequencies (denoted as 'p' for the frequency of the dominant allele and 'q' for the recessive allele) equals 1.\n\nThe discussion progresses to predicting genotype and phenotype frequencies within a population by using the equation p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1. Here, different genotypic frequencies are represented as p^2 for homozygous dominant, 2pq for heterozygous, and q^2 for homozygous recessive, and the sum of these frequencies must also equal 1. The section showcases how to derive the frequency of one genotype based on the known frequencies of others and how these genotype frequencies relate to predicting phenotype frequencies. An example is given detailing the frequency of different flower colors as a function of their genotypic expression in the population. Thus, these principles and equations are crucial tools for understanding the genetic structure and evolution of populations.\n\nThe text concludes by reaffirming the topic's title, \"Topic 7B \u2014 Populations and Evolution,\" emphasizing the overarching theme of the passage provided.","51":"@@@Introduction to Exchange and Transport Systems\nExchanging things with the environment is pretty easy if you're a single-celled organism, but if you're multicellular it all gets a bit more complicated... and it's all down to this 'surface area to volume ratio' malarkey.\n\n@@@Organisms Need to Exchange Substances with their Environment\nEvery organism, whatever its size, needs to exchange things with its environment. Otherwise there'd be no such thing as poop scoops...\n1) Cells need to take in oxygen (for aerobic respiration) and nutrients.\n2) They also need to excrete waste products like carbon dioxide and urea.\n3) Most organisms need to stay at roughly the same temperature, so heat needs to be exchanged too. How easy the exchange of substances is depends on the organism's surface area to volume ratio.\n\n@@@Surface Area to Volume Ratios in Different Sized Animals\nSmaller Animals have Higher Surface Area : Volume Ratios. A mouse has a bigger surface area relative to its volume than a hippo. This can be hard to imagine, but you can prove it mathematically. Imagine these animals as cubes: The hippo could be represented by a block measuring 2 cm x 4 cm x 4 cm. Its volume is 2 x 4 x 4 = 32 cm^3. Its surface area is 2 x 4 x 4 = 32 cm^2 (top and bottom surfaces of cube) + 4 x 2 x 4 = 32 cm^2 (four sides of the cube). Total surface area = 64 cm^2. So the hippo has a surface area: volume ratio of 64:32 or 2:1. Compare this to a cube mouse measuring 1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm. Its volume is 1 x 1 x 1 = 1 cm^3. Its surface area is 6 x 1 x 1 = 6 cm^2. So the mouse has a surface area: volume ratio of 6:1. The cube mouse's surface area is six times its volume, but the cube hippo's surface area is only twice its volume. Smaller animals have a bigger surface compared to their volume.\n\n@@@Exchange Organs and Mass Transport Systems in Multicellular Organisms\nMulticellular Organisms need Exchange Organs and Mass Transport Systems. An organism needs to supply every one of its cells with substances like glucose and oxygen (for respiration). It also needs to remove waste products from every cell to avoid damaging itself. \n1) In single-celled organisms, these substances can diffuse directly into (or out of) the cell across the cell-surface membrane. The diffusion rate is quick because of the small distances the substances have to travel (see p. 39).\n2) In multicellular animals, diffusion across the outer membrane is too slow, for two reasons:\n\u2022 Some cells are deep within the body \u2014 there's a big distance between them and the outside environment.\n\u2022 Larger animals have a low surface area to volume ratio \u2014 it's difficult to exchange enough substances to supply a large volume of animal through a relatively small outer surface. So rather than using straightforward diffusion to absorb and excrete substances, multicellular animals need specialised exchange organs (like lungs \u2014 see p. 58). They also need an efficient system to carry substances to and from their individual cells \u2014 this is mass transport. In mammals, 'mass transport' normally refers to the circulatory system (see p. 70), which uses blood to carry glucose and oxygen around the body. It also carries hormones, antibodies (p. 44), and waste like CO2. Mass transport in plants involves the transport of water and solutes in the xylem and phloem (see pages 78 and 80).","52":"@@@Introduction to Nervous Communication and Response to Stimuli\nYour body has an amazing network of nerve cells which constantly send electrical signals \u2014 a bit like a big circuit board. Animals increase their chances of survival by responding to changes in their external environment, e.g., by avoiding harmful environments such as places that are too hot or too cold. They also respond to changes in their internal environment to make sure that the conditions are always optimal for their metabolism (all the chemical reactions that go on inside them). Plants also increase their chances of survival by responding to changes in their environment (see p. 130). Any change in the internal or external environment is called a stimulus.\n\n@@@Role of Receptors and Effectors\nReceptors detect stimuli\u2014they can be cells or proteins on cell surface membranes. There are loads of different types of receptors that detect different stimuli. Effectors are cells that bring about a response to a stimulus, to produce an effect. Effectors include muscle cells and cells found in glands, e.g., the pancreas. Receptors communicate with effectors via the nervous system or the hormonal system, or sometimes using both.\n\n@@@The Nervous System and Its Functions\nThe nervous system is made up of a complex network of cells called neurones. There are three main types: Sensory neurones transmit electrical impulses from receptors to the central nervous system (CNS) \u2014 the brain and spinal cord. Motor neurones transmit electrical impulses from the CNS to effectors. Relay neurones transmit electrical impulses between sensory neurones and motor neurones. A stimulus is detected by receptor cells and an electrical impulse is sent along a sensory neurone. When an electrical impulse reaches the end of a neurone, chemicals called neurotransmitters take the information across to the next neurone, which then sends an electrical impulse (see p. 139). The CNS (the coordinator) processes the information and sends impulses along motor neurones to an effector. E.g., you see a friend waving. Light receptors (photoreceptors) in your eyes detect the wave. The CNS processes information. Muscle cells are stimulated by the motor neurones. Muscles contract to make your arm wave.\n\n@@@Divisions of the Nervous System\nThe nervous system is split into two different systems: The central nervous system (CNS) \u2014 made up of the brain and the spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system \u2014 made up of the neurones that connect the CNS to the rest of the body. The peripheral nervous system also has two different systems: The somatic nervous system controls conscious activities, e.g., running and playing video games. The autonomic nervous system controls unconscious activities, e.g., digestion. It's got two divisions that have opposite effects on the body: The sympathetic nervous system gets the body ready for action. It's the 'fight or flight' system. The parasympathetic nervous system calms the body down. It's the 'rest and digest' system. Harold thought it was about time his sympathetic nervous system took over. You don't need to learn the structure of the nervous system, but understanding it will help with the rest of the section. Topic 6A \u2014 Stimuli and Responses","53":"@@@Linkage and Epistasis\nRight, this stuff is fairly hard, so if you don't get it first time, don't panic just work through it again until you do...\n\n@@@Some Characteristics are Sex-linked\n1) The genetic information for gender is carried on two sex chromosomes.\n2) In mammals, females have two X chromosomes (XX) and males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY).\n3) A characteristic is said to be sex-linked when the allele that codes for it is located on a sex chromosome.\n4) The Y chromosome is smaller than the X chromosome and carries fewer genes. So most genes on the sex chromosomes are only carried on the X chromosome (called X-linked genes).\n5) As males only have one X chromosome, they often only have one allele for sex-linked genes. So because they only have one copy, they express the characteristic of this allele even if it's recessive. This makes males more likely than females to show recessive phenotypes for genes that are sex-linked.\n6) Genetic disorders caused by faulty alleles on sex chromosomes include color blindness and hemophilia. The faulty alleles for both of these disorders are carried on the X chromosome \u2014 they're called X-linked disorders.\n\n@@@Example of a Sex-linked Disorder: Color Blindness\n1) Color blindness is a sex-linked disorder caused by a faulty allele carried on the X chromosome.\n2) As it's sex-linked both the chromosome and the allele are represented in the genetic diagram, e.g. Xn, where X represents the X chromosome and n the faulty allele for color vision.\n3) The Y chromosome doesn't have an allele for color vision so is just represented by Y.\n4) Females would need two copies of the recessive allele to be color blind, while males only need one copy. This means color blindness is much rarer in women than men.\n5) Parents' genotypes and Gametes' alleles outcome:\nCarrier female (XN Xn) and Unaffected male (XN Y) will result in the following possible genotypes of offspring: XN XN (Unaffected female), XN Y (Unaffected male), XNXn (Carrier female), and Xn Y (Color-blind male). N represents the normal color vision allele, and n represents the faulty color vision allele.\n6) In the example above, there's a 3:1 ratio of offspring without color blindness to offspring with color blindness. But when a female carrier and a male without color blindness have children (as in this example), only their male offspring are at risk of being color-blind. So you can also say that there's a predicted 2:1:1 ratio \u2014 of female offspring without color-blindness: male offspring without color-blindness: male offspring with color-blindness.\n7) This ratio will change if a female carrier (XNXn) and a male with color blindness (XnY) have children. The predicted ratio will then be 1:1 \u2014 of offspring with color-blindness to offspring without color-blindness. The ratio will be the same for offspring of each gender. You only end up with this predicted ratio for a monohybrid F1 cross with a sex-linked characteristic.\n\n@@@Autosomal Genes and Linkage\nD2)Autosome is the fancy name for any chromosome that isn't a sex chromosome. Autosomal genes are the genes located on the autosomes. Genes on the same autosome are said to be linked \u2014 because they're on the same autosome they'll stay together during the independent segregation of chromosomes in meiosis I, and their alleles will be passed on to the offspring together. The only reason this won't happen is if crossing over splits them up first.\n3) The closer together two genes are on the autosome, the more closely they are said to be linked. This is because genes that are close together, like genes A and B, are less likely to be separated by crossing over than genes that are further apart, like genes A and C.\n4) If two genes are autosomally linked, you won't get the phenotypic ratio you expect in the offspring of a cross. For example, in a dihybrid cross between two heterozygous parents, you'd expect a 9:3:3:1 ratio in the offspring (see previous page). Instead, the phenotypic ratio is more likely to be that expected for a monohybrid cross between two heterozygous parents (3:1) because the two autosomally-linked alleles are inherited together. This means that a higher proportion of the offspring will have their parents' (heterozygous) genotype and phenotype.\n5) This allows you to use the predicted phenotypic ratio to identify autosomal linkage.\n\n@@@Genetics of Linked Genes and Crossing Over\nTopic 7A \u2014 Genetics and crossing over is when two homologous (paired) chromosomes swap bits. It happens in meiosis I before independent segregation. You'll have learned about this in Year 1 of your course. An autosome Genes A, B, and C are all linked. Genes A and B are more closely linked than genes A and C because crossing over is less likely to split them up, which affects how genes are inherited and the phenotypic ratios of offspring.","54":"@@@Aerobic Respiration Overview\nAs you know from the previous page, in aerobic respiration, the two molecules of pyruvate from glycolysis enter the mitochondrial matrix for the link reaction. Here's what happens next...\n\n@@@The Link Reaction: Conversion of Pyruvate to Acetyl Coenzyme A\nThe Link Reaction converts Pyruvate to Acetyl Coenzyme A:\n1) Pyruvate is decarboxylated (one carbon atom is removed from pyruvate in the form of CO2). \n2) Pyruvate is oxidised to form acetate and NAD is reduced to form reduced NAD. \n3) Acetate is combined with coenzyme A (CoA) to form acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA). \n4) No ATP is produced in this reaction. The diagram shows coenzyme A (CoA) converting pyruvate, a 3-carbon molecule, into acetyl CoA through steps that release CO2 and reduce NAD to reduced NAD, leading to the formation of acetate and then acetyl CoA. \n\nThe Link Reaction Occurs Twice for Every Glucose Molecule\nTwo pyruvate molecules are made for every glucose molecule that enters glycolysis. This means the link reaction and the third stage (the Krebs cycle) happen twice for every glucose molecule. So for each glucose molecule:\n\u2022 Two molecules of acetyl coenzyme A go into the Krebs cycle (see below).\n\u2022 Two CO2 molecules are released as a waste product of respiration.\n\u2022 Two molecules of reduced NAD are formed and go to the last stage (oxidative phosphorylation, see page 116).\n\n@@@The Krebs Cycle: Producing Reduced Coenzymes and ATP\nThe Krebs cycle involves a series of oxidation-reduction reactions, which take place in the matrix of the mitochondria. The cycle happens once for every pyruvate molecule, so it goes round twice for every glucose molecule. Acetyl CoA from the link reaction combines with a four-carbon molecule (oxaloacetate) to form a six-carbon molecule (citrate). Coenzyme A goes back to the link reaction to be used again. The 6C citrate molecule is converted to a 5C molecule through the removal of CO2 (decarboxylation) and hydrogen (dehydrogenation). This hydrogen is used to produce reduced NAD from NAD.\n\nThen, the 5C molecule is converted to a 4C molecule. Throughout this process, intermediates are formed, decarboxylation and dehydrogenation occur again, producing one molecule of reduced FAD and two of reduced NAD. ATP is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation, where a phosphate group is directly transferred from one molecule to another. Ultimately, citrate is converted back into oxaloacetate.\n\n@@@Aerobic Respiration Map and Transition to Photosynthesis and Respiration Topic\nFollowing the pathways of the Krebs Cycle is the oxidative phosphorylation stage. This map leads us into Topic 5A \u2014 Photosynthesis and Respiration, where the connection between these crucial biological processes is further explored.","55":"@@@Introduction to Measuring Business Size\nIt is common to compare businesses by their size. Who wants to know how large a particular business is? The government might wish to give assistance to \u2018small\u2019 firms, so will need a measure of size. Investors in a firm may wish to compare the size of the business with close competitors \u2013 particularly in order to compare the rate of growth. Customers may prefer to deal only with large firms, assuming, perhaps, that they are more stable and less likely to cease production than smaller ones. There are two problems with these and other requirements for a way of measuring business size: 1 There are several different ways of measuring and comparing business size and they often give different comparative results. A firm might appear large by one measure but quite small by another. 2 There is no internationally agreed definition of what a small, medium or large business is, but the number of employees is often used to make this distinction.\n\n@@@Different Measures of Business Size\nDifferent measures of size include the number of employees, revenue, capital employed, market capitalisation, and market share. Each measure has its advantages and issues when assessing the size of a business.\n\n@@@1. Number of Employees\nThis is the simplest measure. It is easy to understand \u2013 for example, it is obvious to everyone that a shop run by just the owner or their family is small. It is also clear that a firm employing many staff is likely to be large. However, there are problems. How about a business that needs to employ only a few people \u2013 such as a highly automated computer-chip maker with expensive capital equipment? Example: There are two soft drink firms in the same town. One uses traditional methods of production, using 108 people to make 300,000 litres of drink a week. The other is totally automated and produces one million litres a week with just ten staff.\n\n@@@2. Revenue\nRevenue is often used as a measure of size \u2013 especially when comparing firms in the same industry. It is less effective when comparing firms in different industries because some might be engaged in \u2018high-value\u2019 production, such as precious jewels, and another might be in \u2018low-value\u2019 production, such as cleaning services. This measure is needed to calculate market share. Revenue: total value of sales made by a business in a given time period.\n\n@@@3. Capital Employed\nGenerally, the larger the business enterprise, the greater the value of capital needed for long-term investment, or the greater the amount of capital employed. Again, comparisons between firms in different industries may give a rather misleading picture. Two firms employing the same number of staff may have very different capital equipment needs, such as a hairdresser and an optician. The latter will need expensive diagnostic and eyesight-measuring machines. Capital employed: the total value of all long-term finance invested in the business.\n\n@@@4. Market Capitalisation\nMarket capitalisation can be used only for businesses that have shares quoted on the stock exchange (public limited companies). It is calculated by this formula: Market capitalisation = current share price \u00d7 total number of shares issued. Market capitalisation: the total value of a company\u2019s issued shares. As share prices tend to change every day, this form of comparison is not a very stable one. For example, a temporary but sharp drop in the share price of a company could appear to make it much \u2018smaller\u2019 than this measure would normally suggest.\n\n@@@5. Market Share\nMarket share is a relative measure. If a firm has a high market share, it must be among the leaders in the industry and comparatively large. However, when the size of the total market is small, a high market share will not indicate a very large firm. This is calculated using the following formula: total sales of business \/ total sales of industry \u00d7 100. Market share: sales of the business as a proportion of total market sales.","56":"@@@Transport in Plants \u2014 Xylem: Using a Potometer to Estimate Transpiration Rate\nA Potometer can be Used to Estimate Transpiration Rate. A potometer is a special piece of apparatus used to estimate transpiration rates. It actually measures water uptake by a plant, but it's assumed that water uptake by the plant is directly related to water loss by the leaves. You can use it to estimate how different factors affect the transpiration rate. Here's what you'd do: \n1) Cut a shoot underwater to prevent air from entering the xylem. Cut it at a slant to increase the surface area available for water uptake.\n2) Assemble the potometer in water and insert the shoot underwater, so no air can enter.\n3) Remove the apparatus from the water but keep the end of the capillary tube submerged in a beaker of water. Check that the apparatus is watertight and airtight.\n4) Dry the leaves, allow time for the shoot to acclimatise, and then shut the tap.\n5) Remove the end of the capillary tube from the beaker of water until one air bubble has formed, then put the end of the tube back into the water.\n6) Record the starting position of the air bubble.\n7) Start a stopwatch and record the distance moved by the bubble per unit time, e.g., per hour. The rate of air bubble movement is an estimate of the transpiration rate.\n8) Remember, only change one variable (e.g., temperature) at a time. All other conditions (e.g., light, humidity) must be kept constant.\n\n@@@Dissecting Plants to Examine Xylem and Phloem\nYou Might Have to Dissect Plants. You can look at xylem or phloem in plant tissue (e.g., part of a plant stem) under a microscope, and then draw them. But first you need to dissect the plant and prepare a section of the tissue. You can do this using the following method:\n1) Use a scalpel (or razor blade) to cut a cross-section of the stem. Cut the sections as thinly as possible \u2014 thin sections are better for viewing under a microscope.\n2) Use tweezers to gently place the cut sections in water until you come to use them. This stops them from drying out.\n3) Transfer each section to a dish containing a stain, e.g., toluidine blue O (TBO), and leave for one minute. TBO stains the lignin in the walls of the xylem vessels blue-green. This will let you see the position of the xylem vessels and examine their structure.\n4) Rinse off the sections in water and mount each one onto a slide (see page 30).\n\n@@@Practice and Exam Questions on Plant Transport Systems\nPractice Questions:\nQ1) What is the function of xylem tissue?\nQ2) Give four factors that affect transpiration rate.\nQ3) Name a piece of apparatus used to measure transpiration rate.\n\nExam Question:\nQ1 a) What is meant by the term transpiration? [1 mark]\nb) Describe how the cohesion-tension theory helps explain water movement in plants. [3 marks]\n\n@@@Understanding Transpiration and the Role of Xylem\nOne key takeaway from these pages is that xylem is the plant tissue through which water is transported. Water can make its way from the root to the leaves in the lovely xylem tissue, and then some of it will end up being lost into the air from the plant's surfaces (particularly the leaves) via good ol' transpiration. You can use different stains to highlight different parts of the cells. A potometer, which includes parts like the reservoir of water, capillary tube with a scale, and the manipulation of the air-water meniscus, is instrumental in measuring the transpiration rate as the plant takes up water and the air bubble moves along the scale.\n\n@@@Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\nThis text indicates a transition into a new topic or section in the content, which would likely cover additional aspects of exchange and transport systems in biology, moving beyond the specific focus on plant transport and transpiration explored in the previous text.","57":"@@@CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH AND RISK - ANTICOAGULANTS AND PLATELET INHIBITORY DRUGS\nFollowing heart surgery, or after suffering from a blood clot (thrombosis), drug treatments are used to help prevent the blood clotting too easily. Here are two examples. Warfarin is an anticoagulant that interferes with the manufacture of prothrombin in the body. Low prothrombin levels make the blood clot less easily (see Section 1B.2). Warfarin has been used in rat poison \u2013 in high doses the blood will not clot at all and the rats bleed to death after the slightest injury. In humans, the dose is carefully monitored to make sure that the clotting of the blood is reduced but not prevented completely. Platelet inhibitory drugs make the platelets less sticky, and so reduce the clotting ability of the blood. The cheapest and most common of these is aspirin (fig D) but clopidogrel is also commonly used.\n\n\u25b2 fig D Aspirin is a relatively cheap drug. It has been used traditionally as a painkiller. It is also a very effective way of preventing many cardiovascular problems. The risks of taking aspirin are well known \u2013 it irritates the stomach lining and causes bleeding in the stomach which can become serious. A combination of aspirin and clopidogrel can reduce the risk of developing a range of cardiovascular diseases by 20\u201325% in some low-risk patients. However, based on data from several studies it appears that, for some patients, the risk of side-effects is much higher when the two drugs are combined. For example, for every 1000 patients at high risk of CVDs treated for 28 months, five cardiovascular events would be avoided \u2013 but three major stomach bleeds would be caused. In lower-risk patients, 23 cardiovascular events would be avoided while 10 major bleeds would be caused. It is difficult to achieve the correct balance between preventing the blood from clotting too easily while allowing it to clot when necessary. For example, when people are treated with anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin, they must be monitored very carefully to make sure that they do not bleed internally, particularly in the brain. The decision whether to give warfarin will depend on many factors, including the patient\u2019s age and condition as well as other medication they may be taking.\n\n@@@SKILLS DECISION MAKING - CHECKPOINT CHALLENGES & SUBJECT VOCABULARY\nExplain why the side-effects of medication may result in a patient giving up on the treatment.

Natural selection affects different populations in different ways, as you'll soon discover...\n\n@@@Understanding Frequency Patterns in Natural Selection\nDifferent Types of Natural Selection Lead to Different Frequency Patterns. You might remember from the previous page that natural selection alters allele frequency in a population. Stabilising selection and directional selection are types of natural selection that affect allele frequency in different ways. You need to learn these examples:\n\n@@@Antibiotic Resistance as an Example of Directional Selection\nAntibiotic Resistance Shows Directional Selection. Directional selection is where individuals with alleles for characteristics of an extreme type are more likely to survive and reproduce. This could be in response to an environmental change. Bacteria evolving antibiotic resistance is an example of directional selection. Here's how it works:\n1) Some individuals in a population have alleles that give them resistance to an antibiotic.\n2) The population is exposed to the antibiotic, killing bacteria without the resistant allele.\n3) The resistant bacteria survive and reproduce without competition, passing on the allele that gives antibiotic resistance to their offspring.\n4) After some time, most organisms in the population will carry the antibiotic resistance allele.\nPARENTS total population breeding population OFFSPRING\nlow antibiotic resistance high antibiotic resistance\n\n@@@Human Birth Weight: A Case of Stabilising Selection\nHuman Birth Weight Shows Stabilising Selection. Stabilising selection is where individuals with alleles for characteristics towards the middle of the range are more likely to survive and reproduce. It occurs when the environment isn't changing, and it reduces the range of possible characteristics. An example of stabilising selection is human birth weight.\n1) Humans have a range of birth weights.\n2) Very small babies are less likely to survive \u2014 partly because they find it hard to maintain their body temperature.\n3) Giving birth to large babies can be difficult, so large babies are less likely to survive too.\n4) Conditions are most favorable for medium-sized babies \u2014 so weight of human babies tends to shift towards the middle of the range.\nPARENTS total population breeding population OFFSPRING\nweight of baby light weight of baby heavy\n\n@@@Data Interpretation Related to Selection Effects\nYou Need to be Able to Interpret Data on the Effects of Selection. You might be asked to interpret information about an unfamiliar species in the exam. For example: There is a population of rabbits with varying fur length. Longer fur helps to keep the rabbits warmer. The graph shows how the average fur length of the rabbits changed over a period of six years, which had particularly cold winters. The bars span the difference between the shortest and longest fur lengths recorded. \n\n*Describe what the data shows:\nOver the first two years the average fur length is about 21 mm. However, the average length gradually increases from 21 mm to 24 mm. This shows directional selection.\n\n*Suggest a possible cause:\nThe rabbits with the longer fur are more likely to survive the cold winters than the short-furred rabbits. This makes them more likely to reproduce and, when they do, they pass on the allele for long fur to the next generation. Over time, the allele for longer fur becomes more common in the population and the average fur length of the rabbits increases.\n\nTopic 4B \u2014 Diversity, Classification and Variation\nEE\n26\n24\n22\n20\n3) <3)\n18\n16\n12 3 4\nTime (years)","59":"@@@Introduction to Business Objectives and Strategy\nThis chapter covers syllabus section AS Level 1.4, focusing on the importance of business objectives.

It also addresses the potential evolution of objectives over time and how corporate social responsibility and ethics may sway business objectives and activities.\n\n@@@Case Study: Health and Beauty for You\nJune Wong and her brother Will's business, Health and Beauty for You, is used as a case study to illustrate the application of business objectives. They have successfully navigated three difficult years and now wish to set new objectives for growth. June advocates for expansion by acquiring another salon, aiming for sales growth of at least 20% per year. Will prefers to optimize the profitability of the existing salon with a target of $40,000 per year in profit. After lengthy discussions, they compromise on a short-term goal to open a new salon and double sales within three years, followed by a long-term objective to maximize profits across both locations, with a five-year target of $90,000 per year in profits.\n\n@@@Reflection and Discussion on Business Objectives\nThe chapter encourages the reader to consider what is meant by the term 'objective' and the importance of having clear objectives using the case of Health and Beauty for You. Questions posed to the reader aim to stimulate thought on why business objectives might need to be adapted over time and the implications of such changes in a real-world business scenario.\n\n@@@The Role of Objectives in Different Business Structures\nBusinesses, ranging from small sole-traders to larger limited companies, benefit from setting clear objectives. Though not always formally documented in smaller businesses, owners tend to have a precise concept of their goals. For partnerships, agreeing on business directions is vital to prevent time wastage from disputes, thereby enhancing business efficiency. Limited companies are legally required to state their overall objectives in their Memorandum of Association; however, these statements often lack strategic detail.","60":"@@@Introduction to Fertilisers and Eutrophication\nEvery silver lining has a dark cloud \u2014 using fertilisers to replace lost nutrients is all fine and dandy till they don't stay where you put 'em and end up killing all the fish.\n\n@@@Nutrient Loss from Harvested Crops\nNutrients are lost when crops are harvested in several ways:\n1) Crops take in minerals from the soil as they grow and use them to build their own tissues.\n2) When crops are harvested, they're removed from the field where they're grown rather than being allowed to die and decompose there. This means the mineral ions that they contain (e.g., phosphates and nitrates) are not returned to the soil by decomposers in the nitrogen or phosphorus cycles.\n3) Phosphates and nitrates are also lost from the system when animals or animal products are removed from the land. Animals eat grass and other plants, taking in their nutrients. When they are taken elsewhere for slaughter or transferred to a different field, the nutrients aren't replaced through their remains or waste products.\n\n@@@The Role of Fertilisers in Replacing Lost Nutrients\nFertilisers are added to soils to replace lost nutrients, which enables more energy from the ecosystem to be used for growth, increasing the efficiency of energy transfer. There are two main types of fertilisers:\n- Artificial fertilisers are inorganic and contain pure chemicals (e.g., ammonium nitrate) as powders or pellets.\n- Natural fertilisers are organic matter and include manure, composted vegetables, crop residues (the parts left over after the harvest), and sewage sludge. True, Daisy had a dippy fringe, but she sure could produce a lot of fertiliser.\n\n@@@Environmental Issues Associated with Fertiliser Use\nUsing fertilisers raises several environmental issues:\n1) Sometimes more fertiliser is applied than the plants need or are able to use at a particular time.\n2) This can lead to the fertilisers leaching into waterways.\n3) Leaching is when water-soluble compounds in the soil are washed away, e.g., by rain or irrigation systems. They're often washed into nearby ponds and rivers.\n4) This can lead to eutrophication (see next page).\n5) Leaching is more likely to occur if the fertiliser is applied just before heavy rainfall.\n6) Inorganic ions in chemical fertilisers are relatively soluble. This means that excess minerals that are not used immediately are more likely to leach into waterways. In natural fertilisers, the nitrogen and phosphorus are still contained in organic molecules that need to be decomposed by microorganisms before they can be absorbed by plants. This means that their release into the soil for uptake by plants is more controlled, and leaching is less likely.\n7) The leaching of phosphates is less likely than the leaching of nitrates because phosphates are less soluble in water.\n8) Using fertilisers also changes the balance of nutrients in the soil \u2014 too much of a particular nutrient can cause crops and other plants to die.\n\n@@@Summary of Energy Transfer and Nutrient Cycles\nThe section falls under the overarching topic of \"Energy Transfer and Nutrient Cycles\". This emphasizes the relationship between nutrient management, fertiliser use, and the broader ecological processes of nutrient cycling and energy transfer within an ecosystem.","61":"@@@Overview of Digestion and Absorption\nThe whole point of digestion is to break down the food you eat into small molecules that your cells can absorb. As you might imagine, this involves loads of different chemical reactions and our old friends, enzymes. Food is broken down into smaller molecules during digestion because the large biological molecules (e.g., starch, proteins) in food are too big to cross cell membranes. This means they can't be absorbed from the gut into the blood. During digestion, these large molecules are broken down into smaller molecules (e.g., glucose, amino acids), which can move across cell membranes. This means they can be easily absorbed from the gut into the blood, to be transported around the body for use by the body cells. You might remember from Topic 1 A, that most large biological molecules are polymers, which can be broken down into smaller molecules (monomers) using hydrolysis reactions. Hydrolysis reactions break bonds by adding water. During hydrolysis, carbohydrates are broken down into disaccharides and then monosaccharides. Fats are broken down into fatty acids and monoglycerides. Proteins are broken down into amino acids.\n\n@@@The Role of Digestive Enzymes in Food Breakdown\nA variety of different digestive enzymes are produced by specialized cells in the digestive systems of mammals. These enzymes are then released into the gut to mix with food. Since enzymes only work with specific substrates (see page 11), different enzymes are needed to catalyze the breakdown of different food molecules. Amylase is a digestive enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of starch (a polysaccharide) into the smaller sugar maltose (a disaccharide). This involves the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds in starch. Amylase is produced by the salivary glands (which release amylase into the mouth) and also by the pancreas (which releases amylase into the small intestine). Membrane-bound disaccharidases are enzymes that are attached to the cell membranes of epithelial cells lining the ileum (the final part of the small intestine). They help to break down disaccharides (e.g., maltose, sucrose, and lactose) into monosaccharides (e.g., glucose, fructose, and galactose). Again, this involves the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds. There's more on polysaccharides, disaccharides, and monosaccharides on pages 2-5. Monosaccharides can be transported across the cell membranes of the ileum epithelial cells via specific transporter proteins.\n\n@@@Enzymatic Breakdown of Carbohydrates and Lipids\nCarbohydrates are broken down by amylase and membrane-bound disaccharidases. Disaccharidases, such as maltase, sucrase, and lactase, catalyze the conversion of disaccharides into monosaccharide products such as glucose, fructose, and galactose. Lipids are broken down by lipase (with the help of bile salts). Lipase enzymes catalyze the breakdown of lipids into monoglycerides and fatty acids. This involves the hydrolysis of the ester bonds in lipids. Lipases are made in the pancreas and work in the small intestine. Bile salts are produced by the liver and emulsify lipids\u2014this means they cause the lipids to form small droplets, greatly increasing the surface area available for lipases to work on, which is crucial for efficient lipid digestion. Once the lipid has been broken down, the monoglycerides and fatty acids stick with the bile salts to form tiny structures called micelles.\n\n@@@Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\nThis section encapsulates exchange and transport systems in the context of digestion and nutrient absorption. It highlights the importance of reducing large biological molecules to smaller, transportable forms through digestion, the specificity of digestive enzymes, the processes involved in carbohydrate and lipid digestion, and the role of bile salts in facilitating lipid breakdown.","62":"@@@Introduction to the Cardiac Cycle \nThe cardiac cycle is an ongoing sequence of contraction and relaxation of the atria and ventricles that keeps blood continuously circulating round the body. The volume of the atria and ventricles changes as they contract and relax. Pressure changes also occur, due to the changes in chamber volume (e.g., decreasing the volume of a chamber by contraction will increase the pressure in a chamber). The cardiac cycle can be simplified into three stages.\n\n@@@First Stage: Ventricular Relaxation and Atrial Contraction\nVentricles relax, atria contract: The ventricles are relaxed. The atria contract, decreasing the volume of the chambers and increasing the pressure inside the chambers. This pushes the blood into the ventricles. There's a slight increase in ventricular pressure and chamber volume as the ventricles receive the ejected blood from the contracting atria. At this point, the SL valves are closed and the AV valves are open.\n\n@@@Second Stage: Ventricular Contraction and Atrial Relaxation\nVentricles contract, atria relax: The atria relax, while the ventricles contract, decreasing their volume and increasing their pressure. The pressure becomes higher in the ventricles than in the atria, which forces the atrioventricular (AV) valves shut to prevent back-flow. The pressure in the ventricles also overcomes the pressure in the aorta and pulmonary artery, forcing the semilunar (SL) valves open, and blood is ejected into these arteries.\n\n@@@Third Stage: Ventricular and Atrial Relaxation\nVentricles relax, atria relax: The ventricles and the atria both relax. The higher pressure in the pulmonary artery and aorta closes the SL valves to prevent back-flow into the ventricles. Blood returns to the heart, and the atria fill again due to the higher pressure in the vena cava and pulmonary vein, which starts to increase the pressure in the atria. As the ventricles continue to relax, their pressure falls below that of the atria, causing the AV valves to open. This allows blood to flow passively into the ventricles from the atria. The atria then contract, and the whole process begins again. Cardiac contraction is also called systole, and relaxation is called diastole. Blood leaves the heart via the pulmonary artery and aorta when the ventricles contract and the SL valves are forced open, while the AV valves are forced closed to prevent backflow. When the atria and ventricles relax, blood re-enters the heart via the vena cava and the pulmonary veins, the SL valves are forced closed, and the AV valves are forced open to allow the next cycle of blood filling.\n\n@@@Encouragement to Learn More\nThere's a bit about interpreting cardiac cycle data on the next page. So turn over now \u2014 it's well exciting... Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems","63":"@@@Potential Limitations of Applying Technology to Business\n\n1. Costs: Capital costs can be substantial, labour training costs will be necessary and will recur regularly with further technological development. Redundancy costs will be incurred if any existing staff are being replaced by the technology.\n\n2. Labour relations: These can be damaged if the technological change is not explained and presented to workers in a positive way with the reasons for it fully justified. If many jobs are being lost during the process of change, then remaining workers may suffer from reduced job security and this could damage their motivation levels. Trade unions can oppose technological change if it risks too many of their members\u2019 jobs.\n\n3. Reliability: Breakdowns in an automated production or stock-handling systems can lead to the whole process being halted. There may be teething problems with new systems and the expected gains in efficiency may take longer to be realised than forecast.\n\n4. Data protection: The right to hold data on staff and customers is controlled by national laws and the business must keep up-to-date with these legal constraints on its use of IT.\n\n5. Management: Some managers fear change as much as employees do \u2013 especially if they are not very computer literate themselves. In addition, recognizing the need for change and managing the technological change process require a great deal of management skill.\n\nThe management of change within a business is one of the major determinants of successful organizations. See Chapter 40 for more details of change management.\n\n@@@Key Concept Link: IT and Business Decision-Making\n\nThe provision of huge amounts of data to management through the use of IT is referred to as \u2018management information systems\u2019. Computers now provide managers with more data about the operations of their business than was previously thought possible. This has the following benefits: Managers can obtain data quickly and frequently from all departments and regional divisions of the business \u2013 aiding overall control. Computers can be used to analyze and process the data rapidly so that managers can interpret them and take decisions quickly on the basis of them. Management information systems accelerate the process of communicating decisions to those in the organization who need to know.\n\nInformation gives managers the opportunity to review and control the operations of the business. IT-based management information systems provide substantial power to centralized managers and, although this could be used for improving the performance of a business, there are possible drawbacks, too.\n\nThe ease of transferring data electronically can lead to so many messages and communications that \u2018information overload\u2019 occurs. This is when the sheer volume of information prevents decision-makers from identifying the most important information and the areas of the business most in need of action. The power that information brings to central managers could be abused and could lead to a reduction in the authority and empowerment extended to work teams and middle managers. Information used for central control in an oppressive way could reduce job enrichment and hence motivation levels.\n\nThe best managers will apply the detailed information provided by the modern electronic IT systems to improve and speed up their decision-making. They should not allow it to change their style of leadership to a centralized or authoritarian one based on using data to control all aspects of the organization.\n\n@@@Steps for Effectively Introducing Technology\n\nThese are the important stages a business should go through when introducing or updating technology to reduce opposition to change:\n\n- Analyze the potential use of IT and the ways in which it can make the business more effective.\n- Involve managers and other staff in assessing the potential benefits and pitfalls of introducing IT \u2013 better ideas often come from those who will use the system than from those responsible for purchasing it.\n- Evaluate the different systems and programs available \u2013 compare the cost and the expected efficiency and productivity gains. Consider the budget available for this system.\n- Plan for the introduction of the new system, including extensive training for staff and demonstrations to all users.

Covalent bonds are very strong and the molecules formed are usually neutral. However, some covalent compounds are slightly polarized, meaning that the electrons in the covalent bonds are not quite evenly shared. As a result, the molecule has a slightly negative part and a slightly positive part. This separation of charge is called a dipole, and the tiny charges are represented as \u03b4+ and \u03b4\u2013 (see fig F). The molecule is described as a polar molecule. This polarity is particularly common if the bond involves one or more hydrogen atoms. \u25b2 fig D The formation of hydrogen molecules and water molecules are examples of covalent bonding.\n\n@@@THE IMPORTANCE OF INORGANIC IONS\nWhen ionic substances dissolve in water, the ions separate in a process called dissociation. Cells are 60\u201370% water, so in living organisms, most ionic substances exist as positive and negative ions. Many of these ions play specialized roles in individual cells and in the functioning of entire organisms. Here are some of the inorganic ions and their roles that you will encounter as you study biology.\n\n@@@IMPORTANT ANIONS\nNitrate ions (NO3\u2212) are needed in plants to make DNA and also amino acids, therefore, proteins from the products of photosynthesis (see Sections 1A.5, 2B.3 and Book 2 Chapter 5A). Phosphate ions (PO43\u2212) are required in all living organisms to produce ATP and ADP as well as DNA and RNA (see Section 2B.3 and Book 2 Chapter 5A). Chloride ions (Cl\u2212) are involved in nerve impulses, sweating, and many secretory systems in animals (see Book 2 Chapters 7C and 8A). Hydrogencarbonate ions (HCO3\u2212) are needed to buffer blood pH to prevent it from becoming too acidic (see Section 1B.2).\n\n@@@IMPORTANT CATIONS\nSodium ions (Na+) are essential for nerve impulses, sweating and many secretory systems in animals (see Book 2 Chapter 8A). Calcium ions (Ca2+) are vital for the formation of calcium pectate for the middle lamella between two cell walls in plants, and for bone formation and muscle contraction in animals (see Section 4A.1 and Book 2 Chapters 7B and 7C). Hydrogen ions (H+) are necessary for cellular respiration and photosynthesis, and in numerous pumps and systems, as well as pH balance (see Section 2A.4 and Book 2 Chapters 5A and 7A). Magnesium ions (Mg2+) are required for the production of chlorophyll in plants (see Book 2 Chapter 5A).EXAM HINT: Make sure you understand and can explain the difference between ionic substances, charged particles and polar molecules.\n\u25b2 fig C Animals such as cows can use a mineral lick to get the salt they need to function.\n\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

The balance of payments current account records the value of trade in goods and services between one country and the rest of the world. A deficit on this account means that the value of goods and services imported exceeds the value of those exported. This situation presents serious concerns for businesses, particularly if the exchange rate depreciation makes importing and exporting too risky, or if the government steps in with corrective actions such as foreign exchange restrictions and substantial import controls like tariffs and quotas, as is currently implemented by Zimbabwe. Although import controls might reduce competition from imported goods initially, they could lead to retaliation from other countries and reduce export demand, both of which are serious issues for firms that rely on imported supplies.\n\n@@@Exchange Rates and Their Business Impact\nExchange rates are determined by the forces of supply and demand in a free market. Factors influencing demand for a currency include foreign buyers of domestic goods and services, foreign tourists spending in the country, and foreign investors. On the other hand, supply of the currency is affected by domestic businesses buying foreign imports, the domestic population traveling abroad, and domestic investors abroad. When demand for a currency is greater than its supply, its value increases\u2014known as exchange rate appreciation. The domestic firms that benefit from an appreciation include importers of foreign raw materials and components, who can then enjoy lower domestic costs, and importers of foreign manufactured products, who might import goods more cheaply. On the contrary, firms losing out due to appreciation are exporters and domestic market sellers facing foreign competition, as appreciation makes imports cheaper and domestic products less competitive. Additionally, lower import prices can potentially reduce the economy\u2019s inflation rate, benefiting all firms.\n\n@@@Defining Key Terms in Exchange and Trade\nIt is essential to understand key terms within this context. A deficit in the balance of payments context indicates a country is importing more than it exports. Exchange rates are vital as they determine the currency's price in terms of another. Currency appreciation refers to a currency's value rise against others, while currency depreciation signifies a drop in a currency's value. Imports and exports are, respectively, goods and services purchased from or sold to other countries. Factors that determine the currency's demand and supply include foreign investment, tourism, domestic spending abroad, and trade activity. This entire system influences the value and stability of a country's currency, which in turn has a significant impact on its economy and global business operations.","66":"@@@DNA Technology, Classification and Diversity\n\nAdvances in DNA and molecular technology have led to advances in many other fields. For example, scientists have been able to use the technology to help classify organisms more accurately. Advances in Techniques Can Clarify Evolutionary Relationships New or improved technologies can result in new discoveries being made and the relationships between organisms being clarified. This can lead to classification systems being updated. Technologies that have been useful for clarifying evolutionary relationships include:\n\n@@@Genome Sequencing\n\nGenome sequencing \u2014 Advances in genome sequencing have meant that the entire base sequence of an organism's DNA can be determined. The DNA base sequence of one organism can then be compared to the DNA base sequence of another organism, to see how closely related they are. Closely related species will have a higher percentage of similarity in their DNA base order, e.g. humans and chimps share around 94%, humans and mice share about 86%. Genome sequencing has clarified the relationship between skunks and members of the Mustelidae family (e.g. weasels and badgers). Skunks were classified in the Mustelidae family until their DNA sequence was revealed to be significantly different to other members of that family. So they were reclassified into the family Mephitidae.\n\n@@@Comparing Amino Acid Sequences\n\nComparing amino acid sequence \u2014 Proteins are made of amino acids. The sequence of amino acids in a protein is coded for by the base sequence in DNA (see p. 82). Related organisms have similar DNA sequences and so similar amino acid sequences in their proteins. E.g., cytochrome C is a short protein found in many species. The more similar the amino acid sequence of cytochrome C in two different species, the more closely related the species are likely to be.\n\n@@@Immunological Comparisons\n\nImmunological comparisons \u2014 Similar proteins will also bind the same antibodies (see p. 44). E.g., if antibodies to a human version of a protein are added to isolated samples from some other species, any protein that's like the human version will also be recognised (bound) by that antibody. H~ G  d \/Chimpanzee ^\"^3n\/ Antibodies that recognise human protein. So, the chimp protein is more similar to the human one than the mouse protein.\n\n@@@Interpreting Data on DNA and Protein Similarities\n\nYou Need to be Able to Interpret Data on DNA and Protein Similarities. Here are two examples of the kind of thing you might get:\n\nSpecies A Species B Species C Species D 'Species A 100% 86% 42% 44% Species B 86% 100% 51% 53% Species C 42% 51% 100% 91% Species D 44% 53% 91% 100%\n\nThe table on the left shows the % similarity of DNA using DNA sequence analysis between several species of bacteria. You can also use DNA base sequences to see how closely related two members of the same species are. The data shows that species A and B are more closely related to each other than they are to either C or D. Species C and D are also more closely related to each other than they are to either A or B. The diagram on the right shows the amino acid sequences of a certain protein from three different species. You can see that the amino acid sequences from species A and B are very similar. The sequence from species C is very different to any of the other sequences. This would suggest that species A and B are more closely related.\n\nSpecies A \u2014C Val Species B \u2014C Val Species C \u2014(T Phe\n\nTopic 4B \u2014 Diversity, Classification and Variation","67":"@@@Cell Specialization and Xylem Cell Function\nCell specialization refers to the distinct structural and functional roles that various cell types play within a multicellular organism. The xylem cell is a specialized cell type found within the vascular system of plants. Xylem cells form long tubes running along the stem or trunk of plants, which are strengthened by lignin fibers, providing both support and transport functions. They are responsible for carrying water and some dissolved minerals from the roots upwards to other parts of the plant. This water is crucial for various plant processes, including transpiration, where water evaporates and is lost from leaves as water vapor, and photosynthesis, which occurs in the green parts of plants during daylight hours. Xylem tubes originate from numerous individual cells that have died, and the ends of these cells erode away to create continuous tubes through which water is naturally drawn upwards, as shown in Figure 1.15. These tubes have reinforced cell walls that help support the plant's weight.\n\n@@@Phloem Cell Transport Mechanism and Its Role in Plants\nPhloem cells offer a contrasting function to xylem cells; they are responsible for transporting glucose, in the form of sucrose, which is produced during photosynthesis from the leaves to all other parts of the plant within cell sap\u2014a process known as translocation. The sugar is utilized immediately in respiration to release energy for the plant's activities, or it is stored as starch in various cells or structures such as the roots of vegetables. Phloem cells are living cells, and they possess fewer cell organelles to facilitate the easy movement of sugar. These cells are interconnected through sieve plates, which have small holes to accelerate the process of translocation, as depicted in Figure 1.16. These cells are typically arranged alongside xylem cells to form bundles, which compose the visible veins in a leaf, as illustrated in Figure 1.17.\n\n@@@Key Terms in Plant Cell Transportation\nThe key terms related to plant cell transportation include 'Phloem,' which are living cells that transport sugars made through photosynthesis to all plant cells; 'Translocation,' which is the movement of these sugars from the leaves of plants; and 'Organelle,' which refers to specialized subunits within a cell that have specific functions. Additional key terms are 'Xylem,' which are dead plant cells joined together into long tubes that facilitate water flow during transpiration; and 'Transpiration,' which is the process of gradual water vapor release from leaves to maintain the upward 'pull' of water from the soil.\nFigures 1.15 and 1.16 visually represent the parts of xylem and phloem tubes, respectively, while Figure 1.17 shows the arrangement of xylem and phloem tubes in the veins of a leaf, highlighting the transport of water to the leaf and sugars away from it.","68":"@@@INTRODUCTION TO GAS EXCHANGE SYSTEM DISSECTIONS\nAfter learning all about how different organisms are adapted for efficient gas exchange, you might be wondering what those structures really look like. Well, here are some lovely dissections that you might do. How exciting.\n\n@@@REQUIREMENTS FOR BIOLOGY DISSECTIONS\nYou Need to be Able to Carry Out Dissections\n1) As part of your AS or A level in Biology, you're expected to carry out at least one dissection. It could be a dissection of a gaseous exchange system or a mass transport system (or an organ within one of those systems) in either an animal or a plant. You could also be asked about dissections in your exams.\n2) There's an example of a plant dissection that you could do on page 79.\nThese two pages cover some animal dissections that you could do as well or instead.\n3) Whether it's a plant or animal dissection, you're expected to know how to carry it out safely and ethically. You might also need to record your observations using labelled diagrams.\n\n@@@DISSECTION OF ANIMAL GASEOUS EXCHANGE SYSTEMS: LUNGS\nYou Can Dissect the Gaseous Exchange Systems of Animals\nLungs Can be Dissected To Show the Main Structures\n1) You can learn more about the lungs on pages 58-59.\n2) First up, lung dissection is messy, so make sure you're wearing a lab coat.\n3) Your dissecting tools (e.g. scalpels, dissecting scissors) should all be clean, sharp and free from rust \u2014 blunt tools don't cut well and can be dangerous.\n4) Lay the lungs your teacher has given you on a cutting board. They'll probably be sheep or pig lungs from a butcher's shop. You should be able to see the trachea and two bronchi going into the lungs.\n5) To see the lungs inflate, attach a piece of rubber tubing to the trachea and pump air into the lungs using a foot or bicycle pump. The lungs will deflate by themselves because of the elastin in the walls of the alveoli (see p. 61).\n6) Never blow down the tube to inflate the lungs \u2014 you could end up sucking up stale air from inside the lungs into your mouth.\n7) Pop the lungs in a clear plastic bag before you start to stop bacteria inside the lungs from being released into the room.\n8) Once you've seen the lungs inflate, you can examine the different tissue types in the lungs.\n9) The trachea is supported by C-shaped rings of cartilage. A cross-section of the trachea looks like C-shaped cartilage. If you do cut the cartilage be careful \u2014 you need to wear goggles to protect your eyes.\n10) Cartilage is tough, so if you want to open up the trachea, it's best to cut it lengthways, down the gap in the C-shaped rings. Use dissecting scissors or a scalpel to make the cut. If using a scalpel, cut downwards (not towards you) and don't apply too much pressure to the blade.\n11) Continue cutting down one of the bronchi. You should be able to see the bronchioles branching off.\n12) Cut off a piece of the lung. The tissue will feel spongy because of the air trapped in all the alveoli.\n13) Lungs from a butcher are safe for humans to handle, but they could still contain bacteria that cause food poisoning. That's why it's important to wash your hands after the dissection and disinfect work surfaces.\n\n@@@DISSECTING FISH GILLS IN BONY FISH\nHere\u2019s How to Dissect Fish Gills in Bony Fish\n1) Again, make sure you're wearing an apron or lab coat.\n2) Place your chosen fish (something like a perch or salmon works well) in a dissection tray or on a cutting board.\n3) Gills are located on either side of the fish's head. They're protected on each side by a bony flap called an operculum and supported by gill arches.\n4) To remove the gills, push back the operculum and use scissors to carefully remove the gills. Cut each gill arch through the bone at the top and bottom. A single gill arch looks a bit like this: gill filaments under the operculum.\n5) If you look closely, you should be able to see the gill filaments.\n- For more information about the structure and function of fish gills, see page 56.\n\n@@@TOPIC IDENTIFICATION\nTopic 3 A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems","69":"@@@Non-cyclic Photophosphorylation: The Steps and Outcomes\n\nTo understand the process of photosynthesis, specifically non-cyclic photophosphorylation, it is important to be familiar with the photosystems located in the thylakoid membranes. These photosystems are connected by electron carriers, which are proteins that transfer electrons, creating an electron transport chain through which excited electrons can flow. The events described in the following process occur concurrently, but are explained sequentially for clarity.\n\n1) Absorption and Excitement of Electrons by Light Energy:\nLight energy is absorbed by Photosystem II (PSII), which then excites electrons within chlorophyll. These electrons attain a higher energy level and are then released from the chlorophyll, proceeding down the electron transport chain toward Photosystem I (PSI).\n\n2) ATP Formation Through a Proton Gradient:\nAs the excited electrons traverse the electron transport chain, they lose energy. This released energy is then utilized to transfer protons into the thylakoid, creating a proton gradient as there are more protons inside the thylakoid compared to the stroma. Protons then flow back into the stroma through the enzyme ATP synthase, which is embedded in the thylakoid membrane. The energy from this movement is used to synthesize ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi).\n\n3) Photolysis of Water:\nTo replace the electrons that have exited PSII, light energy also facilitates the splitting of water molecules in a process known as photolysis. Water is split into protons (H+ ions), electrons, and oxygen (O2). Consequently, the oxygen generated in photosynthesis originates from water and is produced in this light-dependent reaction.\n\n4) Formation of Reduced NADP:\nLight energy is absorbed once more by PSI, which re-excites the electrons to a higher energy level. These high-energy electrons are then transferred to NADP along with a proton (H+ ion) from the stroma, resulting in the formation of reduced NADP.\n\nThe entire process, wherein electrons flow down the electron transport chain and create a proton gradient that powers ATP synthesis, is called chemiosmosis, explained by the chemiosmotic theory. It is also important to note that 'proton' is simply another term for a hydrogen ion (H+).\n\n@@@Cyclic Photophosphorylation: Simplified ATP Production\n\nCyclic photophosphorylation differs from the non-cyclic version by solely involving Photosystem I (PSI). It is termed 'cyclic' because the electrons from the chlorophyll are not passed to NADP but instead are cycled back to PSI via electron carriers. This recycling allows electrons to repeatedly flow through PSI. Unlike non-cyclic photophosphorylation, cyclic photophosphorylation does not produce reduced NADP or oxygen; it produces only small amounts of ATP.\n\n@@@Summary: Photosynthesis and Its Variations\n\nTopic 5A briefs us on photosynthesis and respiration, providing insights into the fundamental processes that are essential for life. It highlights two distinct methods of photophosphorylation: the non-cyclic and the cyclic. The former involves the production of ATP, reduced NADP, and oxygen as part of the light-dependent reactions in photosynthesis. The latter, a more streamlined method, generates ATP without producing reduced NADP or releasing oxygen. Both processes are crucial components of the photosynthetic mechanism, underpinning life's reliance on the conversion of light energy into chemical energy.","70":"@@@SPECIFICATION REFERENCE1C3: RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBe able to evaluate the design of studies used to determine health risk factors, including sample selection and sample size used to collect data that are both valid and reliable.\nKnow how factors such as diet, high blood pressure, smoking and inactivity increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The non-modifiable factors affecting your risk of developing CVDs \u2013 age, genetics and gender \u2013 are the same all over the world. However, the numbers of people who die of CVDs varies enormously, depending on where you live, as you can see in fig A. This tells us that other factors are involved \u2013 factors which vary with your lifestyle. In the rest of this topic, you will find out more about the lifestyle factors which affect us and influence our risk of developing \u2013 or dying from \u2013 heart disease.\n\n020406080100120140\nLow\/middleincome countriesHigh\/middle income countriesHigh income countriesLow income countries39\n020406080100120140160\nheart attack\n5295\n78109126158\n95\nLow\/middle income countriesDeaths per 100 000 population\nHigh\/middle income countriesHigh income countriesstroke\n\u25b2 fig A Deaths from CVDs in different countries (based on 2012 data)\n\n@@@EXAM HINT\nWhen you are given a graph, try to analyse it briefly before looking at the question.

Your lifestyle can affect your risk of developing atherosclerosis in the future. Epidemiological studies have shown links with smoking, diet and weight, lack of activity and high blood pressure. These are the factors we can change, so we can change our risk of developing CVDs by the lifestyle choices we make.\n\n@@@SMOKING AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nStudies have shown that smokers are far more likely to develop atherosclerosis than non-smokers with a similar lifestyle. Nine out of ten people who need heart bypass surgery or stents as a result of atherosclerosis are smokers. In 2007, a Spanish study showed a clear correlation between smoking and the incidence of death from atherosclerotic heart disease. Causation was established by further research. For example, studies found that the substances in tobacco smoke:\n\u2022can damage the artery linings, which makes the build-up of plaques more likely\n\u2022can cause the arteries to narrow, raise the blood pressure and increase the risk of atherosclerosis.\nSimilar findings were made in a study on adults with heart disease in Jordan in 2017 (see fig B).\n\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Eukaryotic organisms, like us, are not usually made of generalized cells. We have developed specialized cells that have adaptations to allow them to complete specific functions. Red blood cells, for example, have a biconcave shape (which dips in the middle on both sides) and no nucleus to maximize their surface area to absorb more oxygen. Key specialized cells for animals and plants, together with their adaptations, are listed below.\n\n@@@Sperm Cell - Structure and Function\nIn humans, during a male orgasm about a teaspoon of semen is ejaculated. Within this are tens of millions of sperm cells, which must swim through the cervix and uterus to the fallopian tubes. Here one cell may fertilize an egg cell (ovum). Sperm cells have a tail to propel them towards the ovum (Figure 1.10). They have a relatively large number of mitochondria to release the energy from glucose during respiration. This is needed to keep them swimming. The nucleus of a human sperm contains the genetic material (DNA) of the father. This will make up half of the DNA of the baby. At the front of a sperm is an acrosome. This contains digestive enzymes, which break down the outer layer of the ovum, allowing the sperm to enter and fertilize it.\n\n@@@Nerve Cell - Control and Coordination\nOur nervous system controls and coordinates all our actions. These can be either voluntary actions (like picking up the television remote control) or involuntary actions (like our heart beating faster when we exercise). There are two main parts to our nervous system. The first is our central nervous system (CNS), which is made up of our brain and spinal cord. The other is our peripheral nervous system (PNS), which is all the other nerve cells that connect to the CNS but then spread out across the body. To control our actions, signals must be sent and received. These signals are electrical impulses that travel along nerve cells. Synaptic knobs at the end of a nerve cell can communicate with another nerve cell or an effector, such as a muscle.\n\n@@@Key Term and Tip for Understanding Cell Specialization\nBiconcave: Used to describe a shape with a dip that curves inwards on both sides. If you are asked to explain how a cell is adapted to its function, don\u2019t forget to use a connecting phrase like \u2018so that it can\u2019 or \u2018to allow it to\u2019.\n\n@@@Figures for Visual Aid\n\u25b2 Figure 1.10 The parts of a sperm cell. \n\u25b2 Figure 1.11 The parts of a nerve cell.","72":"@@@Analysis of Cell Components\nYou can use microscopes to look at all the lovely organelles you've been learning about...\n\n@@@Magnification versus Resolution\nWe all know that microscopes produce a magnified image of a sample, but resolution is just as important...\n\n@@@Types of Microscopes: Optical and Electron\nThere are Two Main Types of Microscope \u2014 Optical and Electron\n\nOptical (light) microscopes \n1) They use light to form an image.\n2) They have a maximum resolution of about 0.2 micrometres (pm). This means you can't use an optical microscope to view organelles smaller than 0.2 pm. That includes ribosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes. You may be able to make out mitochondria \u2014 but not in perfect detail. You can also see the nucleus.\n3) The maximum useful magnification of an optical microscope is about x 1500.\n\nElectron microscopes \n1) They use electrons to form an image.\n2) They have a higher resolution than optical microscopes so give a more detailed image (and can be used to look at more organelles).\n3) They have a maximum resolution of about 0.0002 micrometres (|jm). (About 1000 times higher than optical microscopes.)\n4) The maximum useful magnification of an electron microscope is about x 1 500 000.\nA micrometre (jjm) is three - orders of magnitude smaller than a millimetre (1 ym = -0.001 mm). To convert from Z to mm, divide by 1000.\n\n@@@Specific Types of Electron Microscopes\nElectron Microscopes are either Scanning or Transmission\n\nTransmission electron microscopes (TEMs)\n1) TEMs use electromagnets to focus a beam of electrons, which is then transmitted through the specimen.\n2) Denser parts of the specimen absorb more electrons, which makes them look darker on the image you end up with.\n3) TEMs are good because they give high resolution images, so you see the internal structure of organelles like chloroplasts.\n4) But they can only be used on thin specimens.\n\nScanning electron microscopes (SEMs)\n1) SEMs scan a beam of electrons across the specimen. This knocks off electrons from the specimen, which are gathered in a cathode ray tube to form an image.\n2) The images you end up with show the surface of the specimen and they can be 3-D.\n3) SEMs are good because they can be used on thick specimens.\n4) But they give lower resolution images than TEMs.\n\n@@@Slide Preparation for Microscopic Examination\nYou View Specimens Under an Optical Microscope Using Slides\n\nHere's how to prepare a 'temporary mount' of a specimen on a slide:\n\u2022 Start by pipetting a small drop of water onto the slide (a strip of clear glass or plastic).\nThen use tweezers to place a thin section of your specimen on top of the water drop.\n\u2022 Add a drop of a stain. Stains are used to highlight objects in a cell. For example, eosin is used to make the cytoplasm show up. Iodine in potassium iodide solution (see p. 4) is used to stain starch grains in plant cells.\n\u2022 Finally, add the cover slip (a square of clear plastic that protects the specimen). To do so, stand the slip upright on the slide, next to the water droplet. Then carefully tilt and lower it so it covers the specimen.\nTry not to get any air bubbles under there \u2014 they'll obstruct your view of the specimen (see page 35).\n\n@@@Topic Overview\nTopic 2A \u2014 Cell Structure and Division","73":"@@@PROTEINS: THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE BODY\nAbout 18% of your body is made up of protein. Proteins make hair, skin, and nails, the enzymes needed for metabolism and digestion, and many of the hormones that control the different body systems. They enable muscle fibers to contract, make antibodies that protect you from disease, help clot your blood and transport oxygen in the form of hemoglobin. Understanding the structure of proteins helps you understand the detailed biology of cells and organisms. Like carbohydrates and lipids, proteins contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. In addition, they all contain nitrogen and many proteins also contain sulfur. Proteins are a group of macromolecules made up of many small monomer units called amino acids joined together by condensation reactions. Amino acids combine in long chains to produce proteins. There are about 20 different naturally occurring amino acids that can combine in different ways to produce a wide range of different proteins.\n\n@@@AMINO ACIDS: THE BASIC STRUCTURE\nAll amino acids have the same basic structure, which is represented as a general formula. There is always an amino group (\u2013NH2) and a carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) attached to a carbon atom (see fig A). The group known as the R group varies between amino acids. Some amino acids contain sulfur and selenium in their R group. The R groups are not involved in the reactions which join the amino acids together, but the structure of the R group does affect the way the amino acid interacts with others within the protein molecule. This will mainly depend on whether the R group is polar or not, and these interactions affect the tertiary structure of the protein formed (see page 18). This part is common to all amino acids and is just shown as a shaded rectangle in the examples below. In the simplest amino acid, glycine, R is a single hydrogen atom. In a larger amino acid such as cysteine, R is much more complex.\n\n@@@LEARNING OBJECTIVES FOR PROTEIN STRUCTURE\n\u25fcKnow the basic structure of an amino acid.\n\u25fcUnderstand the formation of polypeptides and proteins, as amino acid monomers linked together by condensation reactions to form peptide bonds.\n\u25fcUnderstand the significance of a protein\u2019s primary structure in determining its secondary structure, three-dimensional structure, and properties, and the types of bond involved in its three-dimensional structure.\n\u25fcKnow the molecular structure of a globular protein and a fibrous protein and understand how their properties relate to their functions (including hemoglobin and collagen).\n\n@@@FORMING PROTEINS FROM AMINO ACIDS\nAmino acids join by a reaction between the amino group of one amino acid, and the carboxyl group of another. They join in a condensation reaction and a molecule of water is released. A peptide bond is formed when two amino acids join, and a dipeptide is the result (see fig B). The R group is not involved in this reaction. More and more amino acids join to form polypeptide chains, which contain from about 100 to many thousands of amino acids. A polypeptide forms a protein when the structure of the chain changes by folding or coiling or associates with other polypeptide chains.\n\n@@@BONDS IN PROTEINS: CREATING THE 3D STRUCTURES\nThe peptide bond between amino acids is a strong bond. Other bonds are also made between the amino acids in a chain, to create the 3D structures of the protein. They depend on the atoms in the R group and include hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds, and ionic bonds.","74":"@@@SPECIFICATION REFERENCE: DIET AND CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH\nREFERENCE1C4 DIET AND CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH includes several LEARNING OBJECTIVES. These objectives are to know how factors such as diet increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, to be able to analyze data on the possible significance for health of blood cholesterol levels and levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), to know the evidence for a causal relationship between blood cholesterol levels (total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol) and cardiovascular disease, and to understand how people use obesity indicators such as BMI and waist-to-hip ratios. There is strong evidence from around the world that the food we eat has a big effect on our health in many different ways. It certainly has a big impact on the health of our cardiovascular system. However, our understanding of what the effect is and how our food affects our risk of developing cardiovascular diseases keeps changing as scientists learn more.\n\n@@@WEIGHT ISSUES AND MEASURING A HEALTHY WEIGHT: THE BODY MASS INDEX\nWEIGHT ISSUES are prominent in the developed world where there is plenty of food, and people can easily eat more than they need for the metabolic needs of the body. This often leads to a positive energy balance and the excess food energy is converted into fat, causing individuals to become overweight and then obese. Being obese is associated with an increased risk of developing many different diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). THE BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) is an important measurement that doctors and scientists use to determine if an individual is unhealthily heavy. BMI compares a person's weight to their height using the formula BMI = weight in kilograms \/ (height in meters)^2. The following definitions are used for adults: a BMI of less than 18.5 kg\/m^2 indicates underweight, 18.5\u201325 kg\/m^2 is considered an ideal range, over 25 and up to 30 kg\/m^2 means overweight, 30\u201340 kg\/m^2 is considered obese, and over 40 kg\/m^2 defines morbid obesity.\n\n@@@EXAM HINT AND BMI GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION\nAn EXAM HINT for students is to remember that using numbers in examinations, particularly in biology, has often been challenging. It's crucial to apply maths skills accurately to gain easy marks. A common mistake when calculating BMI is forgetting to square the height or using height in centimeters rather than meters. A visual graphic, like figure A, can provide adults with a clear understanding of whether their BMI falls within the healthy range. This graph allows individuals to quickly see how their weight in kilograms lines up with their height in meters to determine if they are underweight, of an okay weight, overweight, obese, or morbidly obese.","75":"@@@Changes in Business Activity and Sector Importance\n\nIt is very important to recognize two features of this classification of business activity: The importance of each sector in an economy changes over time. Industrialisation is the term used to describe the growing importance of the secondary-sector manufacturing industries in developing countries. The relative importance of each sector is measured in terms either of employment levels or of output levels as a proportion of the whole economy. In many countries in Africa and Asia, the relative importance of secondary-sector activity is increasing. This brings many benefits as well as problems.\n\n@@@Benefits of Growing Secondary-Sector Activity\n\nBenefits include the increase in total national output (gross domestic product), which raises average standards of living. Increasing output of goods can lead to lower imports and higher exports of such products. Expanding manufacturing businesses will result in more jobs being created, and expanding and profitable firms will pay more tax to the government. Furthermore, there is value added to the countries' output of raw materials, rather than just exporting these as basic, unprocessed products.\n\n@@@Problems Associated with Growing Secondary-Sector Activity\n\nThe problems include the potential for a significant movement of people from the countryside to the towns, encouraged by the opportunity for work in manufacturing, which may lead to housing and social problems. Imports of raw materials and components are often needed, which can increase the country's import costs. Additionally, much of the growth of the manufacturing industry is due to the expansion of multinational companies, with consequences that will be discussed later in the chapter.\n\n@@@Transition in Developed Economies: Deindustrialisation\n\nIn developed economies, the situation is reversed. There is a decline in the importance of secondary-sector activity and an increase in the tertiary sector. This process is termed deindustrialisation. In the UK, for example, the proportion of total output accounted for by secondary industry has fallen by 15% to 23% in 25 years.\n\n@@@Differences in the Economic Sectors Across Countries\n\nThe balance of these sectors in the economies of different countries varies substantially. It depends on the level of industrialisation in each country. Table 2.1 shows the differences between three countries\u2014United Kingdom, China, and Ghana\u2014illustrating varied employment data for 2013 as a percentage of total employment. Examples of primary production include a dairy farm in France, secondary production can be seen in a clothing factory in China, and an instance of the tertiary sector is the breath-taking Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai. These variances show the unique economic landscape of each nation and how industrialisation shapes the relative significance of each sector.","76":"@@@Introduction to the Light-Independent Reactions in Photosynthesis\nDon't worry, you're over the worst of photosynthesis now. Instead of electrons flying around, there's a nice cycle of reactions to learn. What more could you want from life? Money, fast cars and nice clothes have nothing on this... The Light-Independent Reaction is also called the Calvin Cycle. The Calvin cycle is also known as carbon dioxide fixation because carbon from CO2 is 'fixed' into an organic molecule. The Calvin cycle takes place in the stroma of the chloroplasts. It makes a molecule called triose phosphate from CO2 and ribulose bisphosphate (a 5-carbon compound). Triose phosphate can be used to make glucose and other useful organic substances (see below). There are a few steps in the cycle, and it needs ATP and H+ ions to keep it going. The reactions are linked in a cycle, which means the starting compound, ribulose bisphosphate, is regenerated.\n\n@@@The Detailed Stages of the Calvin Cycle\nHere's what happens at each stage in the cycle: Carbon dioxide is combined with ribulose bisphosphate to form two molecules of glycerate 3-phosphate. CO2 enters the leaf through the stomata and diffuses into the stroma of the chloroplast. Here, it's combined with ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), a 5-carbon compound. This reaction is catalysed by the enzyme rubisco. This gives an unstable 6-carbon compound, which quickly breaks down into two molecules of a 3-carbon compound called glycerate 3-phosphate (GP). Ribulose bisphosphate is regenerated, and ATP and reduced NADP are required for the reduction of GP to triose phosphate. Five out of every six molecules of TP produced in the cycle aren't used to make hexose sugars, but to regenerate RuBP. Regenerating RuBP uses the rest of the ATP produced by the light-dependent reaction. The hydrolysis of ATP (from the light-dependent reaction) provides energy to turn the 3-carbon compound, GP, into a different 3-carbon compound called triose phosphate (TP). This reaction also requires H+ ions, which come from reduced NADP (also from the light-dependent reaction). Reduced NADP is recycled to NADP. Some triose phosphate is then converted into useful organic compounds (e.g. glucose) and some continues in the Calvin cycle to regenerate RuBP. Reduced NADP reduces GP to TP \u2013 this reduction reaction is explained on p. 105.\n\n@@@Conversion of Calvin Cycle Intermediates to Useful Organic Substances\nTP and GP are converted into useful organic substances like glucose. The Calvin cycle is the starting point for making all the organic substances a plant needs. Triose phosphate (TP) and glycerate 3-phosphate (GP) molecules are used to make carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids. Carbohydrates \u2014 hexose sugars (e.g. glucose) are made by joining two triose phosphate molecules together and larger carbohydrates (e.g. sucrose, starch, cellulose) are made by joining hexose sugars together in different ways. Lipids \u2014 these are made using glycerol, which is synthesised from triose phosphate, and fatty acids, which are synthesised from glycerate 3-phosphate. Amino acids \u2014 some amino acids are made from glycerate 3-phosphate.\n\n@@@Overview of Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration\nTopic 5A \u2014 Photosynthesis and Respiration","77":"@@@Enzyme Specificity and the 'Induced Fit' Model\nEnzyme action has long been studied, but the 'induced fit' model is a more refined theory that provides a better explanation for the specificity of enzymes. This model posits that not only must the substrate be the correct shape to fit into the enzyme's active site, but it must also induce the right shape change within the active site itself. This showcases how scientific theories evolve over time with new evidence. The acceptance of the 'induced fit' model is a testament to its current explanatory power in the scientific community.\n\n@@@Outdated Theories and Enzyme Properties\nThe 'Luminous Tights' model, once a popular concept in the 1980s, has now been discredited and is considered inappropriate for explaining enzyme action. The properties of enzymes are intrinsically linked to their tertiary structure. Enzymes are notably specific, typically catalyzing only a single type of reaction. For instance, maltase exclusively breaks down maltose, while sucrase only acts on sucrose. This specificity is due to the unique fit of the complementary substrate into the enzyme's active site, which is in turn shaped by the enzyme's tertiary structure. This tertiary structure stems from the enzyme's primary structure\u2014the sequence of amino acids determined by genetic coding. If any alteration occurs to the tertiary structure, due to factors such as pH or temperature changes, or mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme, it can prevent the enzyme from functioning by altering the shape of the active site. This could result in the inability to form an enzyme-substrate complex and, therefore, a failure to catalyze the intended reaction.\n\n@@@Understanding Enzyme Function and Practice Questions\nEnzyme function and its relationship with its substrate are crucial concepts in biology. Enzymes work by forming complexes with their substrates to lower the activation energy required for a reaction to occur. The enzyme-substrate complex is akin to an assistant in an assault course, providing the necessary help to overcome a high obstacle such as a wall. Without the enzyme's assistance, the energy required to surmount the barrier and proceed with the reaction would be substantially higher. Additionally, included are practice and exam questions designed to test the understanding of these concepts, including the nature of enzymes, the 'induced fit' model, and the consequences of changes in the amino acid sequence of an enzyme. These questions are vital for assessing comprehension and applying knowledge of biological molecules, as seen in Topic 1A.\n\nDo note that the last sentence regarding Topic 1A - Biological Molecules could either be a title for a different section or a mention of a broader category under which the current discussion falls. However, without additional context, it cannot be properly formatted into its own subsection.","78":"@@@Objectives and Decision-Making in Business Strategy\nEffective decision-making requires clear objectives. Business managers cannot decide on future plans of action \u2013 strategies \u2013 if they are uncertain of which direction they want to take the business in. This essential link between decisions and objectives is illustrated in the decision-making framework model shown in Figure 4.4. The stages in this decision-making framework are: \n1. Set objectives. \n2. Assess the problem or situation. \n3. Gather data about the problem and possible solutions. \n4. Consider all decision options. \n5. Make the strategic decision. \n6. Plan and implement the decision. \n7. Review its success against the original objectives. Clearly, without setting relevant objectives at the start of this process, effective decision-making for the future of the business becomes impossible.\n\n@@@The Evolution of Corporate Objectives Over Time\nThere are many examples of businesses changing their corporate objectives over time. These are some of the reasons for this:\n1. A newly formed business may have satisfied the \u2018survival\u2019 objective by operating for several years, and now the owners wish to pursue objectives of growth or increased profit.\n2. The competitive and economic environment may change, so the entry into the market of a powerful rival or the start of an economic recession may lead a firm to switch from growth to survival as its main aim \u2013 or even just to revise its objectives for sales and profits downwards.\n3. A short-term objective of growth in sales or market share might be adapted to a longer-term objective of maximising profits from the higher level of sales.\n\n@@@Determinants of a Business's Corporate Objectives\nCorporate culture plays a huge role in influencing a business's corporate objectives. This can be defined as the code of behaviour and attitudes that influence the decision-making style of the managers and other employees of the business. Culture is a way of doing things that is shared by all those in the organisation. It's about how people perform and deal with others, their approach to the pursuit of objectives, and their adaptability in the face of change. If directors are aggressive in pursuit of their aims and care little about social or environmental factors, then the objectives of the business will be very different from those controlled by directors with a more people- or social-oriented culture.\n\n@@@Influence of Size and Legal Form on Corporate Objectives\nThe size and legal form of the business can also dictate corporate objectives. Owners of small businesses may only aim for a satisfactory level of profit, referred to as 'satisficing.' In contrast, larger businesses, often managed by directors rather than owners like in many public limited companies, may aim for rapid growth to increase the status and power of the managers. This is often a result of the 'divorce between ownership and control,' a common occurrence in large companies with professional directors who do not own the company. They may prioritize their own bonuses, salaries, and fringe benefits\u2014which often depend on business size\u2014over maximizing returns to shareholders.\n\n@@@Aims of Public Versus Private Sector Businesses\nPublic-sector or private-sector orientations also influence business objectives. State-owned organizations typically do not prioritize profit. Their objectives can vary widely, especially when they provide services free of charge, like education and health services. In such cases, setting financial targets would be inappropriate.\n\n@@@Figure 4.4: A Visual Guide to the Decision-Making Framework\n<Insert figure 4.4> The figure represents a decision-making framework with the following steps represented visually:\n1. Set objectives (SMART)\n2. Assess and clarify the problem\n3. Gather data to analyze the problem\n4. Consider ideas and options\n5. Use appropriate tools to decide between options\n6. Plan and implement decision \u2013 action!\n7. Control and review against objectives\n\nAdditional influences on decision-making include external constraints such as law, economy, and competitors, and internal constraints like finance.","79":"@@@Muscle Contraction Overview\nMuscle contraction involves myofilaments sliding over one another, which requires significant energy, hence why exercise feels like hard work.\n\n@@@Structure of Myosin Filaments\nMyosin filaments are integral to muscle contraction and possess specific features that allow them to interact with actin filaments:\n1) Myosin filaments have globular heads that are hinged, enabling them to move back and forth.\n2) Each myosin head has a binding site for actin and a binding site for ATP.\n3) Actin filaments, which work in concert with myosin, have binding sites for myosin heads, referred to as actin-myosin binding sites.\n4) Another protein, tropomyosin, is situated between actin filaments, aiding in the movement of myofilaments past each other.\n\n@@@Tropomyosin and Actin-Myosin Binding in Resting Muscles\nIn resting muscles, the actin-myosin binding sites are obstructed:\n1) Tropomyosin blocks the actin-myosin binding sites on the actin filaments in an unstimulated muscle.\n2) Consequently, myofilaments are unable to slide past one another because the myosin heads cannot bind to the obstructed actin-myosin binding sites.\n\n@@@Calcium's Role in Muscle Contraction\nMuscle contraction begins with the influx of calcium ions:\n1) Muscle cell stimulation by a motor neuron triggers an action potential that leads to the depolarization of the sarcolemma, which then propagates through the T-tubules to the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\n2) The sarcoplasmic reticulum responds by releasing stored calcium ions (Ca2+) into the sarcoplasm.\n3) These calcium ions bind to a protein associated with tropomyosin, causing the protein to alter its shape and, in turn, displacing the tropomyosin from the actin-myosin binding sites on the actin filaments.\n4) As the binding sites are revealed, the myosin heads can form connections with them.\n5) The formed link between a myosin head and an actin filament is known as an actin-myosin cross bridge.\n6) Calcium ions also activate ATP hydrolase, which facilitates ATP breakdown, providing energy for muscle contraction.\n7) The energy released from ATP causes the myosin head to pivot, pulling the actin filament in a rowing motion.\n8) Another ATP molecule is needed to sever the actin-myosin cross bridge, allowing the myosin head to detach from the actin filament once it has shifted its position.\n9) The myosin head then connects to a new binding site farther along the actin filament, and this process repeats, forming new cross bridges, and driving the actin filament's movement.\n10) Numerous cross bridges form and break rapidly, which pulls the actin filament along, shortens the sarcomere, and results in muscle contraction.\n11) This cycle persists while calcium ions remain present.\n\n@@@Muscle Relaxation After Contraction\nThe process of muscle relaxation occurs when excitation ceases:\n1) Upon cessation of stimulation, calcium ions detach from their binding sites and are actively transported back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, requiring ATP.\n2) This causes tropomyosin to return to its position, blocking the actin-myosin binding sites once again.\n3) Muscles then return to an uncontracted state with no actin-myosin cross bridges, as no myosin heads are attached to actin filaments.\n4) Actin filaments then slide back to their original, elongated posture, and sarcomeres lengthen.\n\n@@@Introduction to Nervous Coordination\nNervous coordination, as related to muscle contraction and relaxation, is delineated in Topic 6B.","80":"@@@Overview of The Circulatory System\nThe circulatory system, as the name suggests, is responsible for circulating substances throughout the body, specifically blood. This system is present in most multicellular organisms including mammals, insects, and fish, and plays a crucial role in supporting their complex bodily functions.\n\n@@@Functionality and Composition of The Circulatory System\nThe circulatory system operates as a mass transport system, crucial for organisms with a low surface area to volume ratio, such as mammals. Specialized exchange organs facilitate the movement of raw materials to body cells, organized within this transport network. The system comprises the heart and a series of blood vessels, such as arteries, arterioles, veins, and capillaries. The heart acts as a pump, driving blood through these vessels to reach various body regions. It's essential to be familiar with the names of the blood vessels that enter and leave key organs like the heart, lungs, and kidneys. Blood circulates through two main circuits. One circulates blood between the heart and lungs, and the other services the rest of the body. Additionally, the heart has its own direct blood supply through the coronary arteries. Blood vessels have adapted names for specific regions of the body they supply or collect blood from, including the brain, head, neck, pulmonary vein, pulmonary artery, vena cava, hepatic vein, renal vein, and hepatic artery, indicating the complexity and specificity of the circulatory network.\n\n@@@Differentiation of Blood Vessels\nDifferent blood vessels serve varied functions, tailored to their roles within the circulatory system. Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the body, characterized by their muscular and elastic walls that can handle high pressure. The ability to maintain pressure is also facilitated by their inner folded endothelium. Unique among them, the pulmonary arteries transport deoxygenated blood to the lungs. Arteries subsequently divide into arterioles, which distribute the blood throughout the body, with muscles inside the arterioles regulating blood flow according to demand. Veins, on the other hand, return deoxygenated blood to the heart under lower pressure. They have a wider lumen and less elastic or muscle tissue compared to arteries and incorporate valves to prevent backflow. Blood flow in veins is assisted by contractions of surrounding body muscles. Unlike other veins, the pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart. This differentiation underlines the complexity of the vascular system and its role in maintaining efficient blood circulation throughout the body.","81":"@@@CONJUGATED PROTEINS\nThe shape of a protein molecule is usually very important in its function. Some protein molecules are joined with (conjugated to) another molecule called a prosthetic group (see fig F). This structural feature usually affects the performance and functions of the molecules. These molecules are called conjugated proteins. Haemoglobin is a large protein with iron as the prosthetic group. It is a conjugated protein as well as a globular protein. Lipoproteins are formed when proteins are conjugated with lipids \u2013 you will find out more about these important biological molecules when you look at factors affecting the health of your heart in Chapter 1B. Glycoproteins are proteins with a carbohydrate prosthetic group. The carbohydrate part of the molecule helps them to hold a lot of water and also makes it harder for protein-digesting enzymes (proteases) to break them down. Lots of lubricants used by the human body \u2013 such as mucus and the synovial fluid in the joints \u2013 are glycoproteins. Their water-holding properties make them slippery and viscous, which reduces friction. This also helps to explain why the mucus produced in the stomach protects the protein walls from digestion. Lipoproteins are very important in the transport of cholesterol in the blood. The lipid part of the molecule enables it to combine with the lipid cholesterol. There are two main forms of lipoproteins in your blood \u2013 low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) (around 22 nm in diameter) and high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) (approximately 8\u201311 nm in diameter). The HDLs contain more protein than LDLs, which is partly why they are denser \u2013 proteins are more compact molecules than lipids. You will discover the impact of different lipoproteins on the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases in Section 1C.4.\n\n@@@PRACTICAL SKILLS AND EXAM PREPARATION\nPRACTICAL SKILLS CP2\nRemember that amino acids are joined together by peptide bonds to make dipeptides and then polypeptides.

Understanding these factors is crucial for prevention and management of the disease. Some of the most common risk factors for cardiovascular disease are high blood cholesterol, poor diet, cigarette smoking, and high blood pressure.\n\n@@@High Blood Cholesterol and Poor Diet\nHigh blood cholesterol is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Specifically, if the blood cholesterol level is high, with levels above 240 mg per 100 cm3, the risk is considerably increased. High cholesterol contributes to the formation of atheromas\u2014fatty deposits in the arteries\u2014that can lead to more dangerous health issues such as increased blood pressure, blood clots, myocardial infarction, and possible blockage of blood flow to coronary arteries. Furthermore, diets rich in saturated fats are linked to increased cholesterol levels. Excessive salt intake can also exacerbate the risk by raising the chances of hypertension, otherwise known as high blood pressure.\n\nJohn decided to live on the edge and ordered a fry-up.\n\n@@@Cigarette Smoking and Its Effects\nCigarette smoke contains harmful chemicals like nicotine and carbon monoxide that amplify the risks associated with cardiovascular problems. Nicotine can increase the chance of developing high blood pressure, while carbon monoxide binds with haemoglobin, limiting oxygen transport in the blood and thereby reducing the oxygen available to body tissues. In turn, this can lead to heart attacks if the heart muscle becomes oxygen-deprived. Additionally, smoking lowers blood antioxidant levels, which are essential for cellular protection, potentially leading to more cell damage within coronary artery walls and progressing to atheroma formation.\n\n@@@The Dangers of High Blood Pressure\nElevated blood pressure is another critical risk factor, as it can damage artery walls. This damage enhances the likelihood of atheroma development, which can then raise blood pressure further. Atheromas are also a culprit in blood clot formation, which possesses the potential to obstruct blood flow to heart muscle and provoke myocardial infarctions. Thus, any factors that cause an increase in blood pressure, like being overweight, lack of physical activity, and heavy alcohol consumption, also escalate the risk of cardiovascular diseases.\n\nOther factors influencing cardiovascular disease risk include age, with the risk increasing as one ages, and sex, with men being statistically more prone than women.\n\n@@@The Role of Personal Choice and Uncontrollable Risk Factors\nWhile many risk factors for cardiovascular disease are manageable through personal choices, such as the decision to smoke or consume fatty foods, others are beyond one\u2019s control. For example, genetic predisposition to coronary heart disease or having high blood pressure due to another medical condition, such as certain forms of diabetes, cannot be readily modified. Nonetheless, the overall risk of developing cardiovascular disease can be mitigated by eliminating as many controllable risk factors as possible.\n\n@@@Overview of Exchange and Transport Systems\nThe discussion falls under Topic 3B, which deals with more advanced concepts pertaining to exchange and transport systems within the context of biological systems and physiology. This overarching topic encompasses the mechanisms and pathways through which substances are transported and exchanged throughout an organism, playing a critical role in maintaining homeostasis and overall health.","83":"@@@ Ethical Dimensions in Business Decisions\n\nMost decisions have an ethical or moral dimension. For example, there are various queries such as whether a toy company should market to young children to incentivize purchases by their parents, or if accepting bribes for company orders is permissible. Ethical dilemmas extend to whether a bank should invest in companies involved with weapons or animal testing, the acceptance of using genetically modified food for livestock, and the consideration of environmental impacts when choosing production equipment. Businesses must also consider the fairness in executive compensation, particularly in the context of employee layoffs, and the ethical implications of cost-saving measures like factory closures and low-wage labor policies, including child labor and production of dangerous goods. These dilemmas should be addressed by a company\u2019s ethical code of conduct, describing appropriate employee behaviors and decision-making. Evidence suggests a growing number of companies take the ethical dimension of their actions seriously, considering its impact beyond just profit.\n\n@@@ Communicating Objectives for Effective Business Performance\n\nEffective communication of corporate objectives to employees is crucial since it enables them to contribute to achieving these targets. When employees are informed and involved in setting personal objectives, it aligns with the broader company goals and benefits the organization. This transparency leads to employees and managers achieving more through comprehensive understanding, employees seeing the overall business plan, creating shared responsibility among employees, and enabling managers to monitor progress effectively. Regular monitoring helps in reinforcing performance or providing timely training, ensuring that deadlines and performance standards are met.\n\n@@@ Ethical Influences on Business Objectives and Decisions\n\nThe increasing recognition of corporate social responsibility is reflected in businesses adopting an ethical code to guide decision-making. This ethical code, or code of conduct, contains detailed rules and guidelines that all company employees must follow. It is a crucial element in defining how businesses handle ethical issues and make decisions that impact their operations and reputation.\n\n@@@ Corporate Culture and Business Objectives\n\nThe corporate culture between private and public sector organizations may differ significantly. The values, expectations, and practices that constitute the culture within these organizations guide the establishment and pursuit of business objectives. Understanding and navigating these cultural differences is essential for businesses aiming to achieve their goals effectively.","84":"@@@INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC COMPOUNDS \nBiological molecules are the key to the structure and function of living things. Biological molecules are often organic compounds. Organic compounds all contain carbon atoms. They also contain atoms of hydrogen, oxygen and, less frequently, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. Most of the material in your body that is not water consists of these organic molecules. An understanding of why organic molecules are special will help you to understand the chemistry of biological molecules including carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Each carbon atom can make four bonds and so it can connect to four other atoms. Carbon atoms bond particularly strongly to other carbon atoms to make long chains. The four bonds of a carbon atom usually form a tetrahedral shape. This means carbon compounds can be rings, branched chains or any number of three-dimensional (3D) shapes (see fig A). In some carbon compounds, small molecules (monomers) bond with many other similar units to make a very large molecule called a polymer. The ability of carbon to combine and make macromolecules (large molecules) is the basis of all biological molecules and provides the great variety and complexity found in living things. These two bonds are in the plane of the paper. This bond goes back behind the plane of the paper. This bond sticks out of the plane of the paper. It can be shown with corners representing carbons, and its hydrogens ignored:\nH\nCC\nHHCC\nHH\nHH\nHHC\nHC\nHHCC\nC\nHHC\nHHHH HH\nThis part of a chain molecule:\n\u25b2 fig A The bonds in a carbon atom have a complicated 3D shape. This is difficult to represent, so in most molecular diagrams we use one of several different ways to draw them.\n\n@@@LEARNING OBJECTIVES FOR MONOSACCHARIDES AND DISACCHARIDES \n\u25fc Know the difference between monosaccharides and disaccharides. \n\u25fc Know how to use Benedict\u2019s reagent. \n\u25fc Know how monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, and galactose) join to form disaccharides (maltose, sucrose, and lactose) through condensation reactions forming glycosidic bonds, and how they can be split through hydrolysis reactions.\n\n@@@CARBOHYDRATES: ESSENTIAL ENERGY SOURCES \nCarbohydrates are important in cells as a usable energy source and important in human foods around the world (see fig B). They are also important for storing energy and they form an important part of the cell wall in plants, fungi, and bacteria. Sugars and starch are the best known carbohydrates. Sucrose is the familiar white crystalline table sugar; glucose is used as a fuel by the cells of our bodies. Starch is in rice, flour, and potatoes. But the group of substances called carbohydrates contains many more compounds, as you will discover. \n\u25b2 fig B Carbohydrates are important molecules in both plants and animals \u2013 and carbohydrate foods like this bread play a major role in the human diet. The basic structure of all carbohydrates is the same. They consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are three main groups of carbohydrates: monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides. Some have more complex molecules than others (see Section 1A.3).\n\n@@@MONOSACCHARIDES: THE SIMPLE SUGARS \nMonosaccharides are simple sugars in which there is one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms for each carbon atom in the molecule. A general formula for this can be written (CH2O)n. Here n can be any number, but it is usually low. Triose sugars (n = 3) have three carbon atoms and the general formula C3H6O3. They are important in mitochondria, where the respiration process breaks down glucose into triose sugars (see Book 2 Chapter 7A).\n\n1A1.4 CP1 1.3 1.2(ii) 1.2(i) Uncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

In mature mammals, they are generally thought to be incapable of division and replication. Historically, the regenerative ability of heart cells was doubted, presenting a significant issue when the heart sustained damage from conditions like heart attacks or simply due to aging. However, recent studies have challenged this view, proposing that the heart may possess some capacity to regenerate. The current scientific discourse includes the theory that new cardiomyocytes might replace the old or damaged ones, emerging from a reserve of unipotent stem cells within the heart itself. While some researchers argue that this cell replacement could be an ongoing, albeit slow process\u2014with some cardiomyocytes potentially never being replaced in a person's lifetime\u2014others believe the turnover may occur more rapidly, with all cardiomyocytes being replaced several times throughout an individual's life.\n\n@@@Existing Stem Cell Therapies for Human Disorders\nStem cells offer the versatility of differentiating into various specialized cell types, prompting medical professionals and researchers to consider them for replacing cells lost to diseases or injuries. Currently, stem cells are employed in therapies for blood and immune system diseases. For instance, bone marrow, which houses stem cells capable of becoming any type of blood cell, is utilized in bone marrow transplants. These transplants can correct abnormal blood cell production by introducing healthy stem cells, which then proliferate and specialize. Techniques like these have proven to be effective against leukaemia, lymphoma, and genetic disorders such as sickle-cell anaemia and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). SCID is characterized by defective white blood cells, which are unable to protect the body against infections. Treatment with bone marrow transplants involves providing the patient with donor marrow that contains healthy stem cells, which then develop into functional white blood cells, restoring the immune system's ability to fight off pathogens.\n\n@@@Potential Future Stem Cell Treatments for Various Diseases \nResearch into the possibility of using stem cells for treating a wide array of medical conditions is ongoing. Potential applications are vast, ranging from repairing spinal cord injuries \u2014 by replacing damaged nerve tissue \u2014 to addressing heart diseases and damage resulting from heart attacks, where damaged tissue could be replaced. Similar innovative strategies could involve growing entire bladders from stem cells to replace those affected by disease or regenerating respiratory tissues \u2014 as in the case of donated windpipes stripped to their collagen framework and revivified using stem-cell-generated tissue, ready for patient transplant. Additionally, the cultivation of entire organs from stem cells is being explored as a future option to replenish the donor organ supply for those on waiting lists. \n\n@@@Overview of Genetic Mutations and Expression\nThe text provided briefly introduces the topic of \"Mutations and Gene Expression,\" suggesting it is a separate subject, likely expanded upon in the following sections of the original source material.","86":"@@@Introduction to Business Activity and Enterprise\nThis chapter covers syllabus section AS Level 1.1. Many business managers are paid high salaries to take risks and make decisions that will influence the future success of their business. Much of this book is concerned with how these decisions are made, the information needed to make them, and the techniques that can assist managers in this important task. However, no student of Business can hope to make much progress in the study of this subject unless they have a good understanding of the economic environment in which a business operates. Business activity does not take place in isolation from what is going on around it. The very structure and health of the economy will have a great impact on how successful business activity is. The central purpose of this whole unit, 'Business and its environment', is to introduce the inter-relationships between businesses, the world in which they operate, and the limits that governments impose on business activity. This first chapter explains the nature of business activity and the role of enterprise in setting up and developing businesses.\n\n@@@Case Study: Dulip Starts His Business\nDulip lives in a large country with many natural resources, such as coal and timber. He plans to start a business growing and cutting trees to sell as timber. He wants to buy a forest from a farmer and cut down a fixed number of trees each year. As Dulip is concerned about his environment country\u2019s, he will plant two new trees for each one he cuts down. He has been planning this business venture for some time. He has visited a bank to arrange a loan. He has contacted suppliers of saws and other equipment to check on prices. Dulip has also visited several furniture companies to see if they would be interested in buying wood from the forest. In fact, he did a great deal of planning before he was able to start his business. Dulip is prepared to take risks and will invest his own savings, as well as using the bank loan, to set up the business. He plans to employ three workers to help him to start with. If the business is a success, then he will also try to sell some of the timber abroad. He knows that timber prices are high in some foreign markets. After several months of planning, he was able to purchase the forest. Points to think about: Why do you think Dulip decided to own and run his own business rather than work for another firm? Why was it important to Dulip that he should do so much planning before starting his business? Do you think Dulip will make a successful entrepreneur? Are new businesses such as Dulip\u2019s good for a country\u2019s economy?\n\n@@@The Purpose and Value of Business Activity\nA business is any organization that uses resources to meet the needs of customers by providing a product or service that they demand. There are several stages in the production of finished goods. Business activity at all stages involves creating and adding value to resources, such as raw materials and semi-finished goods, and making them more desirable to \u2013 and thus valued by \u2013 the final purchaser. Without business activity, we would all still be entirely dependent on the goods that we could make or grow ourselves \u2013 as some people in virtually undiscovered native communities still are. Business activity uses the scarce resources of our planet to produce goods and services that allow us all to enjoy a much higher standard of living than would be possible if we remained entirely self-sufficient. On completing this chapter, you will be able to: understand what business activity involves, recognize that making choices as a result of the 'economic problem' always results in opportunity cost, analyze the meaning and importance of creating value, recognize the key characteristics of successful entrepreneurs, assess the importance of enterprise and entrepreneurs to a country\u2019s economy, understand the meaning of social enterprise and the difference between this and other businesses.","87":"@@@Cell Biology Overview\nPlant and animal cells are eukaryotic, meaning they can be unicellular or part of multicellular organisms. Eukaryotic cells typically have a nucleus and are generally larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells. A generalised animal cell, which is a simplified version used to identify key components, is depicted in Figure 1.6. This figure illustrates the generalized animal cell through a microscope at 4800x magnification and through three- and two-dimensional diagrams.\n\n@@@Generalised Animal Cells and Their Components\nIn contrast to bacterial cells discussed previously, animal cells share many common features with them. An animal cell's cytoplasm is mostly water, containing different components such as ribosomes, where it serves as the site for most of the cell's chemical reactions, including protein synthesis. The cell-surface membrane surrounds the animal cell\u2014note that animal cells lack cell walls, making the membrane the outermost layer. It plays a crucial role in regulating the entrance and exit of substances. For example, glucose and oxygen required for respiration diffuse into the cell from the blood, where they are highly concentrated, and carbon dioxide from cellular respiration diffuses back into the blood through this membrane.\n\nMitochondria, the small organelles located in the cytoplasm, are exclusive to eukaryotic cells and are indispensable for cellular respiration. This process is vital for releasing energy stored in glucose, which is necessary for the cell to fulfill the seven life processes. Cells that require more energy, such as those in muscles or sperm, possess a higher number of mitochondria. Intriguingly, mitochondria have an extensive fold inside, maximizing their surface area to enhance the rate of energy release.\n\nLastly, animal cells contain ribosomes, essential for the synthesis of proteins within the cytoplasm. The key term \"Diffusion\" is defined as the net movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of lower concentration. The illustrated components, including the nucleus, cell surface membrane, cytoplasm, mitochondria, and ribosomes, are marked in the visualization to aid in understanding their roles within the cell.","88":"@@@Cell Differentiation in Biology\nThe previous two sections have looked at generalized and specialized animal and plant cells. After generalized cells are formed, they become specialized as an organism develops. This process is called cell differentiation. Your cells did this while you were in your mother\u2019s uterus. Part of this process involves cells developing specific structures within them to allow them to function. For example, muscle cells need to release lots of energy during respiration and so require a high number of mitochondria. Unlike animal cells, most plant cells retain the ability to differentiate throughout their life. We would not be able to take plant cuttings without this. You will learn about this in Chapter 14.\n\n@@@The Evolution of Microscopy\nIt is not very easy to know who invented the first microscope or exactly when this happened. It is likely to have occurred in the 1590s in the Netherlands by makers of eye glasses. Seventy-five years later, in 1665, English scientist Robert Hooke published a book called Micrographia, which was full of impressive images including a drawing of the eyes of a fly using a microscope. In this book he first used the word \u2018cell\u2019, because when he looked at plant cells using his microscope, he was reminded of the cells in a honeycomb. A decade later, in the mid-1670s, a Dutch scientist called van Leeuwenhoek discovered sperm cells and then single-celled bacteria from a human mouth. This was a tremendously important development in science, because before this no one had ever seen a single-celled organism. Imagine not knowing that bacteria and single-celled fungi existed!\n\n@@@Assessment and Practical Microscopy Tips\nTest yourself by answering these questions to assess your understanding of cell biology:\n9. State the function of nerve cells.\n10. State the components that are present in nerve cells.\n11. Describe how red blood cells are adapted for their function.\n12. Describe how root hair cells are adapted for their function.\nShow you can explain why animals and plants have specialized cells. \n\nHere are some practical microscopy tips:\nUse the course focus at low magnification first to find your sample easily. Then increase the magnification lens by lens. Finally, use the fine focus to make your image as sharp as possible.\n\u25b6 Figure 1.18 A labelled diagram of a light microscope includes the eyepiece lens, objective lens, stage, specimen, mirror, coarse focus, and fine focus.","89":"@@@Overview of Gas Exchange in Humans\nIn humans, gas exchange takes place in the lungs. You need to know the structure of the lungs as well as how they're ventilated. Take a deep breath. Humans need to get oxygen into the blood (for respiration) and they need to get rid of carbon dioxide (made by respiring cells). This is where breathing (or ventilation as it's sometimes called) and the gas exchange system comes in.\n\n@@@The Structure of the Human Gas Exchange System\nThe human gas exchange system involves intercostal muscles, bronchus, bronchiole, and alveoli. The process starts as you breathe in, with air entering the trachea (windpipe). The trachea splits into two bronchi, with one leading to each lung. These bronchi then branch off into smaller tubes called bronchioles. These bronchioles eventually lead to small 'air sacs' known as alveoli, which is where gases are actually exchanged. The ribcage, intercostal muscles, and diaphragm all work together to move air in and out. Notably, there are actually three layers of intercostal muscles, but the internal and external intercostal muscles are the two you need to know about for your exam. For simplicity, only one layer is shown in the illustration.\n\n@@@The Ventilation Process: Inspiration and Expiration\nVentilation consists of two main movements: inspiration (breathing in) and expiration (breathing out), which are controlled by the movements of the diaphragm, internal and external intercostal muscles, and ribcage. During inspiration, the external intercostal and diaphragm muscles contract, causing the ribcage to move upwards and outwards and the diaphragm to flatten. This action increases the volume of the thoracic cavity, where the lungs are located, and decreases the lung pressure relative to the atmospheric pressure. As air flows from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure, this results in air flowing into the lungs. Inspiration is an active process requiring energy.\n\nIn expiration, the external intercostal and diaphragm muscles relax, returning the ribcage and diaphragm to their original positions, which decreases the volume of the thoracic cavity and increases the air pressure inside the lungs, forcing air out. Normal expiration is passive and doesn't require energy. However, expiration can be forced, like when blowing out candles on a birthday cake. In forced expiration, while the external intercostal muscles relax, the internal intercostal muscles contract, pulling the ribcage further down and in, with the two sets of intercostal muscles' movements described as antagonistic or opposing.\n\n@@@Topic Context\nThis explanation of the human gas exchange system and the ventilatory process forms part of the broader biological topic on Exchange and Transport Systems.","90":"@@@Interpreting Vaccine and Antibody Data\n\nIf someone claims anything about a vaccine or antibody, the claim has to be validated (confirmed) before it's accepted. To do this, you need to evaluate the data used to support the claim and the methodology behind it.\n\n@@@New Knowledge About Vaccines and Antibodies is Validated by Scientists\n\nWhen a study presents evidence for a new theory (e.g. a vaccine has a dangerous side effect), it's important that other scientists come up with more evidence to validate (confirm) the theory. Other scientists may repeat the study and try to reproduce the results, or conduct other studies to try to prove the same theory.\n\n@@@EXAMPLE 1: The MMR Vaccine\n\n1) In 1998, a study was published about the safety of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The study was based on 12 children with autism (a life-long developmental disability) and concluded that there may be a link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n2) Not everyone was convinced by this study because it had a very small sample size of 12 children, which increased the likelihood of the results being due to chance. The study may have been biased because one of the scientists was helping to gain evidence for a lawsuit against the MMR vaccine manufacturer. Also, studies carried out by different scientists found no link between autism and the MMR vaccine.\n3) There have been further scientific studies to sort out the conflicting evidence. In 2005, a Japanese study was published about the incidence of autism in Yokohama (an area of Japan). They looked at the medical records of 30,000 children born between 1988 and 1996 and counted the number of children that developed autism before the age of seven. The MMR jab was first introduced in Japan in 1989 and was stopped in 1993. During this time the MMR vaccine was administered to children at 12 months old. The graph shows the results of the study.\n4) In the exam, you could be asked to evaluate evidence like this.\n\u2022 You might be asked to describe the data... The graph shows that the number of children diagnosed with autism continued to rise after the MMR vaccine was stopped. For example, from all the children born in 1992, who did receive the MMR jab, about 60 out of 10,000 were diagnosed with autism before the age of seven. However, from all the children born in 1994, who did not receive the MMR jab, about 160 out of 10,000 of them were diagnosed with autism before the age of seven.\n\u2022 ...or draw conclusions: There is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\u2022 ...or evaluate the methodology: You can be much more confident in this study, compared to the 1998 study, because the sample size was so large \u2014 30,000 children were studied. A larger sample size means that the results are less likely to be due to chance.\n\n@@@EXAMPLE 2: Herceptin\u00ae\u2014 Monoclonal Antibodies\n\nAbout 20% of women with breast cancer have tumors that produce more than the usual amount of a receptor called HER2. Herceptin\u00ae is a drug used to treat this type of breast cancer \u2014 it contains monoclonal antibodies that bind to the HER2 receptor on a tumor cell and prevent the cells from growing and dividing. In 2005, a study tested Herceptin\u00ae on women who had already undergone chemotherapy for HER2-type breast cancer. 1694 women took the drug for a year after chemotherapy, and another 1694 women were observed for the same time (the control group). The results are shown in the graph on the right.\nDescribe the data: Almost twice as many women in the control group developed breast cancer again or died compared to the group taking Herceptin\u00ae.\nDraw conclusions: A one-year treatment with Herceptin\u00ae, after chemotherapy, increases the disease-free survival rate for women with HER2-type breast cancer.\n\n@@@Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n\nThis could be a chapter title or heading for a section that potentially discusses the involvement of cells and the immune system, possibly in relation to vaccines and their effectiveness. However, without additional context or content, it's not clear what specific information follows under this topic.","91":"@@@Understanding Inheritance Through Punnett Squares\nInheritance can be visualized using a method known as the Punnett square, serving as a way to predict the genetic outcomes for an offspring's genotype and phenotype. An example is provided where the parental genotypes are crossed to determine the alleles of the gametes. This is shown step by step: 1) Determine the alleles the gametes would carry from the parents\u2019 genotype, which would be heterozygous (Nn). 2) Cross the parents' gametes to display the potential genotypes of the F1 generation, resulting in all heterozygous Nn individuals. 3) Further cross the gametes' alleles of the F1 generation to predict the possible genotypes of the F2 generation. A Punnett square illustrates a 75% probability that the offspring will have normal wings and a 25% probability of vestigial wings, leading to a 3:1 ratio. More specifically, there is a 1 in 4 chance of the genotype NN (normal wings), 2 in 4 chances for genotype Nn (normal wings), and a 1 in 4 chance for genotype nn (vestigial wings). From this, one can conclude a phenotype ratio of normal to vestigial wings is 3:1.\n\n@@@Codominance and Sickle-Cell Anaemia\nThe concept of codominance is illustrated by alleles that are equally expressed in the phenotype, with neither allele being recessive. The example provided is the allele associated with sickle-cell anaemia. People who are homozygous with normal haemoglobin (HbA HbA) do not have the disease. Those homozygous for sickle haemoglobin (HbS HbS) show symptoms of sickle-cell anaemia, with all red blood cells being sickle-shaped. Individuals who are heterozygous (HbA HbS) depict characteristics of both, known as the sickle-cell trait, having a mix of normal and sickle haemoglobin. The alleles are codominant because both contribute to the individual's phenotype. A genetic diagram is used to demonstrate the potential offspring from two parents who both possess the sickle-cell trait, resulting in various possible genotypes and phenotypes\u2014unaffected, heterozygous carrying the sickle-cell trait, and sickle-cell anaemia.\n\n@@@Multiple Alleles and Blood Group Inheritance\nWhen a gene has more than two alleles, inheritance becomes more intricate. The ABO blood group system is a classic example featuring three alleles: I^O for blood group O, I^A for blood group A, and I^B for blood group B. Among them, the allele I^O is recessive, while the alleles I^A and I^B display codominance, where individuals with genotype I^AI^B express blood group AB. A genetic cross is illustrated between two heterozygous individuals, one with blood group A and another with blood group B, revealing that their offspring could exhibit one of four distinct blood groups\u2014A, B, O, or AB. Even though recessive blood groups are typically rare, the prevalence of blood group O in Britain is unusually high due to a significant number of individuals with the I^O I^O genotype among the population's ancestors.\n\n@@@Topic 7A \u2014 Genetics\nThe discussion belongs to Topic 7A which falls under the broader category of Genetics, encompassing the study of heredity and variation in organisms and how these genetic traits are transmitted from parents to their offspring.","92":"@@@1BSPECIFICATION REFERENCE2 - THE ROLES OF THE BLOOD\nIn mammals, the mass transport system is the cardiovascular system. This is made up of a series of vessels with the heart as a pump to move blood through the vessels. The blood is the transport medium and its passage through the vessels is called the circulation. The system delivers the materials needed by the cells of the body and carries away the waste products of their metabolism. Substances move between the plasma or red blood cells and the body cells by diffusion or by active transport (see Section 2A.4). The tiniest blood vessels have walls only one cell thick, so diffusion distances are short and substances pass easily across these into other cells. Every cell in the body is near one of these small vessels. The blood also carries out other functions, such as carrying hormones (chemical messages) from one part of the body to another, forming part of the defence system of the body and distributing heat.\n\n@@@THE COMPONENTS OF THE BLOOD AND THEIR MAIN FUNCTIONS\nYou are going to study all three parts of the cardiovascular system, starting with the transport medium \u2013 the blood. Your blood is a complex mixture carrying a wide variety of cells and substances to all areas of your body (see fig A) which includes red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets as shown in the light micrograph figure A.\n\n@@@LEARNING OBJECTIVES\nUnderstand the role of haemoglobin in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide.\nUnderstand the oxygen dissociation curve of haemoglobin, the Bohr effect and the significance of the oxygen affinity of fetal haemoglobin compared with adult haemoglobin.\nUnderstand the blood clotting process.\n\n@@@PLASMA\nYour blood plasma is the fluid part of your mass transport system. Over 50% of your blood volume is plasma, and it carries all of your blood cells and everything else that needs transporting around your body. This includes digested food products (e.g. glucose and amino acids) from the small intestine to the liver and then to all the parts of the body where they are needed either for immediate use or storage, nutrient molecules from storage areas to the cells that need them, excretory products (e.g. carbon dioxide and urea) from cells to the organs such as the lungs or kidneys that excrete them from the body, and chemical messages (hormones) from where they are made to where they cause changes in the body. The plasma helps to maintain a steady body temperature by transferring heat around the system from internal organs (e.g. the gut) or very active tissues (e.g. leg muscles in someone running) to the skin, where it can be lost to the surroundings. It also acts as a buffer to regulate pH changes.\n\n@@@ERYTHROCYTES (RED BLOOD CELLS)\nThere are approximately 5 million erythrocytes per mm3 of blood (4\u20135 million per mm3 in women, 5\u20136 million per mm3 in men). They contain haemoglobin, a red pigment that carries oxygen and gives them their color (see Section 1A.5). They are made in the bone marrow. Mature erythrocytes do not contain a nucleus and have a limited life of about 120 days. The erythrocytes transport oxygen from the lungs to all the cells. They are well adapted for their function. The biconcave disc shape of the cells means that they have a large surface area to volume ratio, so oxygen can diffuse into and out of them rapidly (see fig B). Having no nucleus leaves much more space inside the cells for the haemoglobin molecules that carry the oxygen. In fact, each red blood cell contains around 250\u2013300 million molecules of haemoglobin and can carry approximately 1000 million molecules of oxygen. Haemoglobin also carries some of the carbon dioxide produced in respiration back to the lungs. The rest is transported in the plasma.","93":"@@@ATP: The Immediate Source of Energy in a Cell\n\nATP (adenosine triphosphate) is an important molecule in all living things. Without it, we wouldn't be able to function. On the plus side, that would mean no exams \u2014 but on the other hand, we wouldn\u2019t know the great smell of freshly baked bread. Ahh... Plant and animal cells release energy from glucose \u2014 this process is called respiration. A cell can't get its energy directly from glucose. So, in respiration, the energy released from glucose is used to make ATP. ATP is made from the nucleotide base adenine, combined with a ribose sugar and three phosphate groups. It's what's known as a nucleotide derivative because it's a modified form of a nucleotide. Once made, ATP diffuses to the part of the cell that needs energy. The energy in ATP is stored in high energy bonds between the phosphate groups. It's released via hydrolysis reactions (see below).\n\n@@@ATP: Rapid Synthesis and Utilization\n\nWhen energy is needed by a cell, ATP is broken down into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and Pi (inorganic phosphate). This is a hydrolysis reaction. A phosphate bond is broken and energy is released. The reaction is catalysed by the enzyme ATP hydrolase. ATP hydrolysis can be 'coupled' to other energy-requiring reactions in the cell \u2014 this means the energy released can be used directly to make the coupled reaction happen, rather than being lost as heat. The released inorganic phosphate can also be put to use \u2014 it can be added to another compound (this is known as phosphorylation), which often makes the compound more reactive. ATP can be re-synthesised in a condensation reaction between ADP and Pi. This happens during both respiration and photosynthesis and is catalysed by the enzyme ATP synthase.\n\n@@@Visual Representations and Additional Notes\n\n\u00a9\"'11111 \/1,  iADP + Pi adenosine diphosphate i.e., it has 2 phosphates.

Carbon dioxide passes into the plasma and red blood cells by diffusion. It combines with water to form carbonic acid, catalysed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. Carbonic acid dissociates to give hydrogen ions and hydrogen carbonate ions. Hydrogen carbonate ions pass out of the red blood cells by diffusion, and chloride ions move in. This is called the chloride shift. Haemoglobin acts as a buffer, accepting the hydrogen ions to form haemoglobinic acid to avoid changing the pH of the blood. Tissue cells, plasma, CO2, H2O, H2CO3, HCO3\u2013, HHb, HbH+, and erythrocyte Cl\u2013 are all part of this process. The transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs depends on the reaction of carbon dioxide with water, controlled by an enzyme in the red blood cells.\n\n@@@THE BOHR EFFECT\nThe way in which haemoglobin collects and releases oxygen is also affected by the proportion of carbon dioxide in the tissues (see fig E). When the proportion of carbon dioxide in the tissues is high, the affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen is reduced. In other words, haemoglobin needs higher levels of oxygen to become saturated and releases oxygen much more easily. So in active tissues with high carbon dioxide levels, haemoglobin releases oxygen more readily. Carbon dioxide levels in the lung capillaries are relatively low, which makes it easier for oxygen to bind to the haemoglobin. The changes in the oxygen dissociation curve that result as the carbon dioxide level changes are known as the Bohr effect. As the proportion of carbon dioxide in the environment rises, the haemoglobin curve moves down and to the right, so it gives up oxygen more easily.\n\n@@@FETAL HAEMOGLOBIN\nA fetus in the uterus depends on its mother to supply it with oxygen. Oxygenated blood from the mother flows through the placenta close to the deoxygenated fetal blood. If the blood of the fetus had the same affinity for oxygen as the blood of the mother, very little oxygen would be transferred. Fortunately, the blood of the fetus contains a special form of the oxygen-carrying pigment called fetal haemoglobin. Fetal haemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than the adult haemoglobin of the mother. Consequently, the fetal haemoglobin can remove oxygen from the maternal blood even when the proportion of oxygen is relatively low (see fig F). The maternal and fetal blood also run in opposite directions which increases the efficiency of oxygen transfer. Remember that as CO2 builds up it affects the pH and this has an effect on the protein structure, so haemoglobin does not work as well (i.e., it has a lower affinity for oxygen).\n\nNote: The phrase 'Uncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Well, you need to learn it all again now but with a bit of extra detail for Topic 7. Great. At least there's some extra new stuff to get your teeth stuck into...\n\n@@@Causes of Variation Within a Species\nVariation is the differences that exist between individuals. Variation within a species means that individuals in a population can show a wide range of different phenotypes. Although individuals of the same species have the same genes, they have different alleles (versions of genes) \u2014 this causes genetic variation within a species. The main source of this genetic variation is mutation, e.g. when changes in the DNA base sequence lead to the production of new alleles \u2014 see page 180. But genetic variation is also introduced during meiosis (through the crossing over of chromatids and the independent segregation of chromosomes) and because of the random fertilisation of gametes during sexual reproduction. Variation within a species can also be caused by differences in the environment, e.g. climate, food, lifestyle. Most variation within a species is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. But only genetic variation results in evolution.\n\n@@@Evolution Defined as a Change in Allele Frequencies\nEvolution is a Change in Allele Frequencies Over Time. The frequency of an allele in a population changes over time \u2014 this is evolution. \n\n@@@Mechanisms of Evolution: Natural Selection and Genetic Drift\nNatural selection is one method by which evolution occurs. Here's a reminder of how it works: Individuals of the same species vary because they have different alleles. Predation, disease, and competition (selection pressures) create a struggle for survival. Because individuals vary, some are better adapted to the selection pressures than others. This means there are differential levels of survival and reproductive success in a population. Individuals with a phenotype that increases their chance of survival are more likely to survive, reproduce and pass on their genes (including the beneficial alleles that determine their phenotype), than individuals with a different phenotype. This means that a greater proportion of the next generation inherit the beneficial alleles. They, in turn, are more likely to survive, reproduce and pass on their genes. So the frequency of the beneficial alleles in the gene pool increases from generation to generation. Evolution also occurs by genetic drift. A selection pressure is anything that affects an organism's chance of survival and reproduction.\n\n@@@Different Patterns of Natural Selection\nDifferent Types of Natural Selection Lead to Different Frequency Patterns. Stabilising selection and directional selection are types of natural selection that affect allele frequency in different ways. You'll have covered these in Topic 4, but now there's an extra one to learn about \u2014 disruptive selection. STABILISING SELECTION is where individuals with alleles for characteristics towards the middle of the range are more likely to survive and reproduce. It occurs when the environment isn't changing, and it reduces the range of possible phenotypes. Example: In any mammal population there's a range of fur length. In a stable climate, having fur at the extremes of this range reduces the chances of surviving as it's harder to maintain the right body temperature. Animals with alleles for average fur length are the most likely to survive, reproduce and pass on their alleles. So these alleles increase in frequency. The proportion of the population with average fur length increases and the range of fur lengths decreases.

Without water, substances could not move around the body. Water is one of the reactants in the process of photosynthesis, on which almost all life depends (see fig E). Understanding the properties of water will help you understand many key systems in living organisms. Water is also a major habitat \u2013 it supports more life than any other part of the planet. \u25b2 fig E Water is vital for life on Earth in many different ways \u2013 in a desert, the smallest amount of water allows plants to grow.\n\n@@@THE CHEMISTRY OF WATER\nThe simple chemical formula of water is H2O. This tells us that two atoms of hydrogen are joined to one atom of oxygen to make up each water molecule. However, because the electrons are held closer to the oxygen atom than to the hydrogen atoms, water is a polar molecule (see fig F). 104.5\u00b0O\u03b42 H\u03b41H\u03b41 \u25b2 fig F A model of a water molecule showing dipoles. One major effect of this polarity is that water molecules form hydrogen bonds. The slightly negative oxygen atom of one water molecule will attract the slightly positive hydrogen atoms of other water molecules in a weak electrostatic attraction called a hydrogen bond. Each individual hydrogen bond is weak but there are many of them so the molecules of water \u2018stick together\u2019 more than you might expect (see fig G). Water has relatively high melting and boiling points compared with other substances that have molecules of a similar size because it takes a lot of energy to break all the hydrogen bonds that hold the molecules together. Hydrogen bonds are important in protein structure (see Sections 1A.5 and 2B.1) and in the structure and functioning of DNA (see Section 2B.3).O\u03b42 O\u03b42 H\u03b41H\u03b41H\u03b41H\u03b41 H\u03b41O\u03b42O\u03b42 O\u03b42H\u03b41 H\u03b41 H\u03b41H\u03b41H\u03b41 \u25b2 fig G Hydrogen bonding in water molecules, based on attraction between positive and negative dipoles.\n\n@@@THE IMPORTANCE OF WATER\nThe properties of water make it very important in biological systems for many reasons.\n\u2022 Water is a polar solvent. Because it is a polar molecule, many ionic substances like sodium chloride will dissolve in it (see fig H). Many covalently bonded substances are also polar and will dissolve in water, but often do not dissolve in other covalently bonded solvents such as ethanol. Water also carries other substances, such as starch.

You don't have to milk the cows, but you do need to know how to increase the efficiency of energy transfer.\n\n@@@Food Webs Show How Energy is Transferred Between Organisms\n1) Food chains and food webs show how energy is transferred through an ecosystem.\n2) Food chains show simple lines of energy transfer. Each of the stages in a food chain is called a trophic level.\n3) Food webs show lots of food chains in an ecosystem and how they overlap.\n4) Decomposers (e.g., fungi) are also part of food webs. Decomposers break down dead or undigested material, allowing nutrients to be recycled (see page 124).\nOak tree (producer)\nCaterpillar (primary consumer)\nStarling (secondary consumer)\nMr. Cuddles (tertiary consumer)\nApple tree (producer)\nMouse (primary consumer)\nHawk (tertiary consumer)\n\n@@@Farming Practices Increase The Efficiency of Energy Transfer\nMost farming practices aim to increase the amount of energy that is available for human consumption. There are different ways this can be done. You need to know about two of them.\n1) The energy lost to other organisms, e.g., pests, can be reduced.\n2) The energy lost through respiration can be reduced.\n\n@@@(T) Simplifying Food Webs Reduces Energy Loss to Other Organisms\nHere's an example of a simplified food web involving a crop plant grown for human consumption. The weed, the mouse, and the aphid are pests\u2014organisms that reduce the amount of energy available for crop growth and therefore the net primary production (NPP). This ultimately reduces the amount of energy available for humans.\nBy simplifying the food web, i.e., getting rid of food chains that don't involve humans, energy losses will be reduced and the NPP of the crop will increase.\nweed\u2014aphid\u2014ladybird \n*wheat\u2014mouse\u2014hawk\nSimplifying the food web means getting rid of pests\u2014and for that, farmers need pest control.\n1) Farmers can reduce pest numbers using chemical pesticides. For example:\n\u2022 Insecticides kill insect pests that eat and damage crops. Killing insect pests means less biomass is lost from crops, so they grow to be larger, which means NPP is greater.\n\u2022 Herbicides kill weeds (unwanted plant species). Killing weeds can remove direct competition with the crop for energy from the Sun. It can also remove the preferred habitat or food source of the insect pests, helping to further reduce their numbers and simplify the food web.\n2) Biological agents also reduce the numbers of pests, so crops lose less energy and biomass, increasing the efficiency of energy transfer to humans.\n\u2022 Parasites live in or lay their eggs on a pest insect. Parasites either kill the insect or reduce its ability to function, e.g., some wasp species lay their eggs inside caterpillars\u2014the eggs hatch and kill the caterpillars.\n\u2022 Pathogenic (disease-causing) bacteria and viruses are used to kill pests, e.g., the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produces a toxin that kills a wide range of caterpillars.\n3) Farmers can use integrated systems that combine both chemical and biological methods. The combined effect of using both can reduce pest numbers even more than either method alone, meaning NPP is increased even more.\n\n@@@Topic 5B \u2014 Energy Transfer and Nutrient Cycles\nNatural predators can also be introduced to the ecosystem to eat the pest species, e.g., ladybirds eat aphids\u2014this is useful but doesn't really simplify the food web. The topic also delves into Energy Transfer and Nutrient Cycles as essential concepts within the ecosystem.","98":"@@@Introduction to Biological Molecules and Carbohydrates\nEven though there is, and has been, a huge variety of different organisms on Earth, they all share some biochemistry\u2014 for example, they all contain a few carbon-based compounds that interact in similar ways.\n\n@@@Most Carbohydrates are Polymers\n1) Most carbohydrates (as well as proteins and nucleic acids) are polymers. 2) Polymers are large, complex molecules composed of long chains of monomers joined together. 3) Monomers are small, basic molecular units. 4) Examples of monomers include monosaccharides, amino acids and nucleotides. monomer e.g. monosaccharide, amino acid polymer e.g. carbohydrate, protein\n\n@@@Carbohydrates are Made from Monosaccharides\n1) All carbohydrates contain the elements C, H and O. 2) The monomers that they're made from are monosaccharides, e.g. glucose, fructose and galactose. 1) Glucose is a hexose sugar \u2014 a monosaccharide with six carbon atoms in each molecule. 2) There are two types of glucose, alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2)\u2014 they're isomers (molecules with the same molecular formula as each other, but with the atoms connected in a different way). 3) You need to know the structures of both types of glucose for your exam\u2014 it's pretty easy because there's only one difference between the two: \u03b1-glucose molecule \u03b2-glucose molecule CH2OH CH2OH H OH HO H OH The two types of glucose have these groups reversed.\n\n@@@Condensation Reactions Join Monosaccharides Together\n1) A condensation reaction is when two molecules join together with the formation of a new chemical bond, and a water molecule is released when the bond is formed. 2) Monosaccharides are joined together by condensation reactions. 3) A glycosidic bond forms between the two monosaccharides as a molecule of water is released. 4) A disaccharide is formed when two monosaccharides join together. Example: Two \u03b1-glucose molecules are joined together by a glycosidic bond to form maltose. HH O \/ H a-glucose HO H O is removed a-glucose HO H H O 5) Sucrose is a disaccharide formed from a condensation reaction between a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule. 6) Lactose is another disaccharide formed from a glucose molecule and a galactose molecule. glycosidic bond O \/ H + H2O maltose OH If you're asked to show a condensation reaction, don't forget to put the water molecule in as a product.","99":"@@@THE ROLES OF THE BLOOD IN MAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS\nThe roles of the blood in mammalian transportation systems are multifaceted and critical for maintaining life. One vital function is the clotting of blood, which acts as a protective mechanism in instances like injuries.\n\n@@@THE CLOTTING OF THE BLOOD\nYou have a limited volume of blood. In theory, a minor cut could endanger life as the torn blood vessels allow blood to escape. First, your blood volume will reduce and if you lose too much blood, you will die. Second, pathogens can get into your body through an open wound. In normal circumstances, your body protects you through the clotting mechanism of the blood. This mechanism seals damaged blood vessels to minimize blood loss and prevent pathogens from getting in.\n\n@@@FORMING A CLOT\nPlasma, blood cells, and platelets flow from a cut vessel. Contact between the platelets and components of the tissue (e.g., collagen fibers in the skin) causes the platelets to break open in large numbers. They release several substances, two of which are particularly important. Serotonin causes the smooth muscle of the blood vessel to contract. This narrows the blood vessels, cutting off the blood flow to the damaged area. Thromboplastin is an enzyme that starts a sequence of chemical changes that clot the blood (see fig H). The cascade of events that result in a life-saving or life-threatening clot begins with damaged tissue stimulating platelets to release thromboplastin. This enzyme, along with prothrombin and calcium ions, starts a series of reactions that convert fibrinogen into fibrin, forming a clot catalyzing the entire process, depicted in figure H. This cascade seals the blood vessels and protects the delicate new tissues that form underneath.\n\n@@@THE BLOOD CLOTTING PROCESS\nThe blood clotting process is a very complex sequence of events involving many different clotting factors. Vitamin K is important in the production of many compounds necessary for blood clotting, including prothrombin. Here is a simplified overview of the events:\n1. Thromboplastin catalyzes the conversion of a large soluble protein called prothrombin found in the plasma into another soluble protein, the enzyme called thrombin. Prothrombin is biologically inactive, while thrombin is biologically active \u2013 prothrombin is a precursor of thrombin. This conversion occurs extensively at the site of a wound. Calcium ions must be present in the blood at the right concentration for this reaction to occur.\n2. Thrombin then acts on another soluble plasma protein called fibrinogen, converting it into an insoluble substance called fibrin. Fibrinogen, like prothrombin, is the biologically inactive precursor of biologically active fibrin. The fibrin forms a mesh of fibers that cover the wound. A learning tip to remember is that 'pro' indicates a precursor, such as prothrombin, which will form an active molecule during the blood clotting process.\n\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

A hydrolysis reaction breaks the chemical bond between monomers using a water molecule. It's basically the opposite of a condensation reaction. For example, carbohydrates can be broken down into their constituent monosaccharides by hydrolysis reactions. In the process, known as PolymerA Hydrolysis, the bond is broken by the addition of a water molecule (-OH HO- -- OH). Even hydrolysis couldn't break this bond, illustrating the resilience of certain chemical connections within biological molecules.\n\n@@@Use the Benedict\u2019s Test for Sugars\nSugar is a general term for monosaccharides and disaccharides. All sugars can be classified as reducing or non-reducing. The Benedict's test is used to identify the presence of reducing sugars. Reducing sugars include all monosaccharides, such as glucose, and some disaccharides, such as maltose and lactose. To perform the test, you add Benedict's reagent, a blue substance, to a sample and heat it in a water bath that has been brought to boil. A positive reaction is indicated by the formation of a colored precipitate. The color progression of the precipitate during a positive reaction typically follows these stages: blue, then green, then yellow, then orange, and finally brick red. Always use an excess of Benedict\u2019s solution to ensure that all the sugar reacts. The higher the concentration of reducing sugar, the further the color change goes, which can be used comparatively across different solutions. For a more accurate quantification, filtering the solution and weighing the precipitate is recommended.\n\nIf the outcome of the reducing sugars test is negative, indicating absence, it is possible that a non-reducing sugar such as sucrose is present. To test for non-reducing sugars, a new sample must be initially broken down into monosaccharides by adding dilute hydrochloric acid and heating in a boiling water bath, followed by neutralization with sodium hydrogencarbonate. The Benedict's test is then used in the same manner as for reducing sugars. A positive test will result in a colored precipitate, while a negative test will maintain the blue color, signifying that no sugars (reducing or non-reducing) are present.\n\nTopic 1A refers to Biological Molecules, indicating that these tests and reactions are fundamental concepts within the study of biochemistry and molecular biology.","101":"@@@Early Mass-Production and Taylorism at the Ford Factory in the 1930s\nManufacturers in the early 1930s adopted Frederick Taylor's approach to mass-production, as seen in the Ford factory. Taylor's theory, often called Taylorism, emphasized the optimization of work to ensure maximum efficiency.\n\n@@@Mayo's Human Relations Theories and the Hawthorne Effect\nElton Mayo, who lived from 1880 to 1949, became prominent for his 'Hawthorne effect' conclusions result of experiments carried out with his team at the Hawthorne factory of Western Electric Co. in Chicago over a five-year period. These experiments originally aimed to identify the effect of working conditions\u2014such as lighting, heating, and rest periods\u2014on productivity. Despite varying these conditions, they found that productivity increased even in the control group, leading Mayo to conclude that working conditions were not the sole determinants of productivity levels, and that other motivational factors were at play.\n\n@@@The Hawthorne Effect: Contextual Findings and Implications for Productivity\nThe Hawthorne effect led to several key conclusions: Changes in working conditions and financial rewards had minimal impact on productivity, whereas factors like management's engagement with workers, the development of team spirit, and the autonomy of workers to influence their work environment had positive motivational effects. These findings suggest that informal group dynamics and leaders play a significant role in setting productivity norms.\n\n@@@Assessing the Relevance of Mayo's Research for Modern Businesses\nMayo's work has influenced the modern business world, fostering trends such as increased worker participation and the establishment of personnel departments to integrate the Hawthorne effect into practice. Team and group working are now prevalent in various business organizations, providing opportunities to benefit from these insights. The focus on workers' welfare and individual goals has shaped new research fields for industrial psychologists, marking this as a key area in university business courses. This shift towards the 'people side' of business represents a move away from the purely engineer-focused, financial motivation models of the past.\n\n@@@Maslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs and Its Impact on Business Management\nAbraham Maslow (1908\u20131970) extended research into human motivation beyond the workplace and is known for his hierarchy of human needs. This theory is significant to business managers because it posits that human needs drive actions\u2014people are motivated to satisfy these needs. Maslow's research has had wide-reaching implications, affecting fields such as psychology, sociology, and business management.","102":"@@@Introduction to the Genetic Code and Its Characteristics\n\nThe genetic code is exactly as it sounds\u2014a code found in your genes that tells your body how to make proteins. It can be interpreted, just like any other code, which is exactly what you might have to do in your exam. The genetic code is the sequence of base triplets (codons) in mRNA which code for specific amino acids. In the genetic code, each base triplet is read in sequence, separate from the triplet before it and after it. Base triplets don't share their bases\u2014the code is non-overlapping. Other features of the genetic code include its degeneracy\u2014there are more possible combinations of triplets than there are amino acids (20 amino acids but 64 possible triplets). This means that some amino acids are coded for by more than one base triplet, e.g., tyrosine can be coded for by UAU or UAC. Some triplets are used to tell the cell when to start and stop production of the protein\u2014these are called start and stop signals (or codons). They're found at the beginning and end of the mRNA. E.g., UAG is a stop signal. Additionally, the genetic code is universal\u2014the same specific base triplets code for the same amino acids in all living things. E.g., UAU codes for tyrosine in all organisms.\n\n@@@Understanding and Using Nucleic Acid Data\n\nYou need to be able to interpret data about nucleic acids. The table on the right shows the mRNA codons (triplets) for some amino acids. You might have to interpret information like this in the exam. For example, using the table, you could be asked to give the DNA sequence for amino acids. The mRNA codons for the amino acids are given in the table. Because mRNA is a complementary copy of the DNA template, the DNA sequence for each amino acid is made up of bases that would pair with the mRNA sequence. You could also be asked to work out the amino acids from a given DNA sequence and a table. When interpreting data on nucleic acids, remember that DNA contains T (thymine) and RNA contains U (uracil).\n\n@@@Applying Knowledge of Codons and Anticodons\n\nTo work out the sequence of amino acids from some mRNA, you need to break the genetic code into codons and then use the information in the table to work out what amino acid they code for. You could also be asked to give the tRNA anticodons from mRNA codons. tRNA anticodons are complementary copies of mRNA codons, so you can work out the tRNA anticodon from the mRNA codon. Additionally, you may be asked to name the amino acid coded for by a tRNA anticodon using a table like the one above.\n\n@@@Sequencing Amino Acids from mRNA Codons\n\nTo demonstrate your understanding, you might need to write the amino acid sequence for a section of mRNA. By looking at the sequence of mRNA and breaking it down into codons, you can determine the sequence of amino acids that will be formed. For instance, mRNA codons Such as CUA, GUG, CGC, UAU, and UCU would translate into amino acids Leucine, Valine, Arginine, Tyrosine, and Serine respectively. This process is a fundamental part of the topic of DNA, RNA, and Protein Synthesis in biology.","103":"@@@Market Failure 1: External Costs\nPollution resulting from manufacturing is a good example of market failure. When a business makes a product, it has to pay for the costs of the land, capital, labour and materials, which are called the private costs of production. However, we are all aware of the consequences of production other than those from the use of these factors. Air pollution, noise pollution and the dumping of waste products are all side effects of most manufacturing processes. The question is, who pays the costs of cleaning up after the production of chemicals or plastics, for example? Unless the business is forced to pay, the costs will be borne by the rest of society; the government or local authority will have to raise taxes to clean the buildings dirtied by smoke, pay for medical provision for those affected by air pollution and make provision for waste disposal. External costs are defined as costs of an economic activity that are not paid for by the producer or consumer, but by the rest of society. In this example, the market has failed to reflect the true and total cost of production in the price of the product. If the price charged to consumers included all of the costs of production \u2013 private as well as external \u2013 then less would be demanded and produced. Since the price charged does not include the external costs, too much of the product will be demanded and too much produced, leading to market failure.\n\n@@@Market Failure 2: Labour Training\nA second type of market failure is related to labor training. There is a dilemma for firms when deciding whether to pay for the training of staff when there is a real danger that, once qualified, they could be \u2018poached\u2019 by other businesses that have not paid for the training. As a result, many firms will not make sufficient provision for training. This creates a shortage of skilled workers and professional staff, which will restrict economic growth. Therefore, there is under-provision of training, and this is another form of market failure.\n\n@@@Market Failure 3: Monopoly Producers\nMarket failure also occurs when a market is dominated by one firm, creating a monopoly. Such a business will be interested in maximizing profits, often by restricting output and raising prices. Due to the monopolist's ability to prevent competitors from entering the market, the strategy used will likely lead to under-provision of goods and services relative to what consumers would prefer. This is yet another example of market failure.\n\n@@@Correcting or Controlling Market Failure\nApproaching the issue of market failures, Table 9.7 in the discussed literature explores the three examples of market failure mentioned above, analyzing the groups most affected and considering the corrective actions that could be taken.\n\n@@@Income Elasticity of Demand \u2013 Economic Influence on Businesses\nIncome elasticity of demand is a concept that helps to understand the opportunities for businesses during periods of economic growth, as it varies greatly across different sectors. Some businesses will see substantial increases in demand, while others will experience a more limited rise \u2013 or even a decrease in certain cases. The income elasticity of demand is a measure of how responsive the demand for a product is following a change in consumer incomes, which is a key term in analyzing the varied economic impacts. There are several measures of elasticity, with others explained in another chapter.\n\nThe formula for calculating income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in demand for a product divided by the percentage change in consumer income. This measure can describe three classes of goods: normal goods, with an income elasticity that is positive and between 0 and 1, meaning demand increases with income but at a smaller proportion. These are often essential goods like basic foods and pharmaceuticals, for which demand doesn't fluctuate drastically with changes in income.","104":"@@@INTRODUCTION TO CARBOHYDRATES\nSo, you've already looked at monosaccharides and disaccharides... now it's time to give polysaccharides some love. Polysaccharides are Loads of Sugars Joined Together A polysaccharide is formed when more than two monosaccharides are joined together by condensation reactions. a-glucose a-glucose a-glucose a-glucose a-glucose You need to know about the relationship between the structure and function of three polysaccharides\u2014 starch, glycogen, and cellulose.\n\n@@@STARCH: THE MAIN ENERGY STORAGE MATERIAL IN PLANTS\nStarch is the Main Energy Storage Material in Plants one alpha-glucose molecule 1) Cells get energy from glucose. Plants store excess glucose as starch (when a plant needs more glucose for energy, it breaks down starch to release the glucose). 2) Starch is a mixture of two polysaccharides of alpha-glucose \u2014 amylose and amylopectin: \u2022 Amylose \u2014 a long, unbranched chain of a-glucose. The angles of the glycosidic bonds give it a coiled structure, almost like a cylinder. This makes it compact, so it's really good for storage because you can fit more into a small space. \u2022 Amylopectin \u2014 a long, branched chain of a-glucose. Its side branches allow the enzymes that break down the molecule to get at the glycosidic bonds easily. This means that the glucose can be released quickly. Amylopectin 3) Starch is insoluble in water and doesn't affect water potential (see page 40), so it doesn't cause water to enter cells by osmosis, which would make them swell. This makes it good for storage.\n\n@@@IODINE TEST FOR STARCH\nUse the Iodine Test for Starch If you do any experiment on the digestion of starch and want to find out if any is left, you'll need the iodine test. Just add iodine dissolved in potassium iodide solution to the test sample. If there is starch present, the sample changes from browny-orange to a dark, blue-black color.\n\n@@@GLYCOGEN: THE MAIN ENERGY STORAGE MATERIAL IN ANIMALS\nGlycogen is the Main Energy Storage Material in Animals Glycogen 1) Animal cells get energy from glucose too. But animals store excess glucose as glycogen\u2014 another polysaccharide of alpha-glucose. 2) Its structure is very similar to amylopectin, except that it has loads more side branches coming off it. Loads of branches mean that stored glucose can be released quickly, which is important for energy release in animals. 3) It's also a very compact molecule, so it's good for storage.\n\n@@@GLYCOGEN DEPLETION AFTER ACTIVITY\nAfter throwing and fetching the ball no less than 312 times, Chappy and Stuart were finally out of glycogen.

They're much smaller than eukaryotic cells \u2014 and, luckily for both of us, so is the section on them in this book. Nevertheless, you need to know everything in it for your exams.\n\n@@@Prokaryotic Cell Structure\nThe Structure of Prokaryotic Cells is Different to Eukaryotic Cells\nRemember, prokaryotic cells are smaller and simpler than eukaryotic cells (see page 24). Bacteria are examples of prokaryotic cells. You need to know the structure of a prokaryotic cell and what all the different organelles do. See pages 25-26 for more on organelles. The cell wall supports the cell and prevents it from changing shape. It's made of a polymer called murein. Murein is a glycoprotein (a protein with a carbohydrate attached). Some prokaryotes, e.g. bacteria, also have a capsule made up of secreted slime. It helps to protect bacteria from attack by cells of the immune system.\n\nThe cytoplasm of a prokaryotic cell has no membrane-bound organelles (unlike a eukaryotic cell). It has ribosomes \u2014 but they're smaller than those in a eukaryotic cell.\nPlasmids are small loops of DNA that aren't part of the main circular DNA molecule. Plasmids contain genes for things like antibiotic resistance, and can be passed between prokaryotes. Plasmids are not always present in prokaryotic cells. Some prokaryotic cells have several.\n\nUnlike a eukaryotic cell, a prokaryotic cell doesn't have a nucleus. Instead, the DNA floats free in the cytoplasm. It's circular DNA, present as one long coiled-up strand. It's not attached to any histone proteins (see page 82). The flagellum (plural: flagella) is a long, hair-like structure that rotates to make the prokaryotic cell move. Not all prokaryotes have a flagellum. Some have more than one. Just like in a eukaryotic cell, the plasma membrane is mainly made of lipids and proteins. It controls the movement of substances into and out of the cell.\n\nTheo went the wrong way about getting practical experience in understanding cell structure.\n\n@@@Characteristics of Viruses\nViruses are Acellular\u2014 They\u2019re Not Cells\nViruses are just nucleic acids surrounded by protein \u2014 they're not even alive. They're even smaller than bacteria \u2014 e.g. HIV is about 0.1 pm across. Unlike bacteria, viruses have no plasma membrane, no cytoplasm, and no ribosomes. All viruses invade and reproduce inside the cells of other organisms. These cells are known as host cells. \n\nViruses contain a core of genetic material, either DNA or RNA. The protein coat around the core is called the capsid. Attachment proteins stick out from the edge of the capsid. These let the virus cling on to a suitable host cell. \n\nDNA and RNA are nucleic acids; see page 16 for more information.\n\n@@@Topic Area\nTopic 2A \u2014 Cell Structure and Division","106":"@@@Energy Transfer in Ecosystems\n\nAn ecosystem includes all the organisms living in a particular area and all the non-living (abiotic) conditions. In all ecosystems, there are producers \u2014 organisms that make their own food, for instance, plants and algae produce their own food through photosynthesis. During the process of photosynthesis, plants use energy from sunlight and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or dissolved in water in aquatic ecosystems to make glucose and other sugars. Sugars produced during photosynthesis are utilized in respiration to release energy for growth, while the remainder is used to create other biological molecules like cellulose which is a component of plant cell walls. These biological molecules comprise the plant's biomass\u2014the mass of living material. Biomass is also considered as the chemical energy stored in the plant. Energy gets transferred through the living organisms of an ecosystem when organisms consume each other, such as producers being eaten by primary consumers. Primary consumers are in turn eaten by secondary consumers, and secondary consumers are eaten by tertiary consumers, constituting a food chain.\n\n@@@Measuring Biomass\n\nBiomass can be measured in terms of the mass of carbon that an organism contains or the dry mass of its tissue per unit area. Dry mass refers to the mass of the organism after all the water has been removed; it is determined by drying a sample of the organism, often in an oven set to a low temperature until the water is removed, indicated by a stable mass upon consecutive weighings. The dry mass obtained from the sample can then be scaled to estimate the total population or ecological area's biomass. A common unit for dry mass is kg\/m^2, with the mass of carbon generally considered to be 50% of the dry mass. To quantify the chemical energy in biomass, one can burn it in a calorimeter where the heat emitted indicates the energy content, measured in joules or kilojoules. A sample of dry biomass is incinerated, and the energy released heats a known volume of water; the resulting change in temperature enables calculation of the biomass's chemical energy.\n\n@@@GPP and NPP as Measures of Energy Storage\n\nGross primary production (GPP) is the complete chemical energy converted from light energy by plants in a certain area. However, roughly 50% of the gross primary production is lost to the environment as heat during plant respiration, termed respiratory loss (R). The energy that remains after this loss is known as net primary production (NPP), calculated as GPP minus R. NPP represents the energy that is available to the plant for growth and reproduction, stored in its biomass and also the energy accessible to organisms at the next stage in the food chain, including herbivores and decomposers. Primary production can be expressed as a rate, indicating the total amount of chemical energy or biomass produced per unit area over a certain time period, with typical units such as kilojoules per hectare per year or kilojoules per square meter per year, known as primary productivity. For example, the grass in an ecosystem with a gross primary productivity of 20,000 kj m^2 yr^-1 that experiences respiratory losses of 8,000 kj m^2 yr^-1 would yield a net primary productivity of 12,000 kj m^2 yr^-1.","107":"@@@MAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS: THE ROLES OF THE BLOOD\nHealthy red blood cells have a biconcave disc shape as shown in fig B. They serve crucial functions in mammalian transport systems.\n\n@@@LEUCOCYTES (WHITE BLOOD CELLS)\nLeucocytes, or white blood cells, are much larger than erythrocytes and possess the adaptability to change shape, allowing them to squeeze through tiny blood vessels. Their population ranges between around 4000 to 11,000 per mm3 of blood, and they come in several types. White blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, while some types mature in the thymus gland. These cells have a primary role in defending the body against infections and are also key to the inflammatory response when tissue is damaged. All leucocytes have a nucleus and colorless cytoplasm, although some contain granules that can be stained. The various types of leucocytes are covered more in-depth in Book 2, Chapter 6B.\n\n@@@PLATELETS\nPlatelets, tiny fragments broken off from large cells known as megakaryocytes found in the bone marrow, number between 150,000 to 400,000 per mm3 of blood. These cell fragments are instrumental in the blood clotting process, which is further discussed on page 35.\n\n@@@TRANSPORT OF OXYGEN\nTransportation of oxygen is mainly achieved through the abundance of haemoglobin molecules within red blood cells. Each haemoglobin, a large globular protein composed of four peptide chains with an iron-containing prosthetic group, can reversibly bind four molecules of oxygen to form oxyhaemoglobin. The binding of the first oxygen molecule alters the structure of haemoglobin, making it easier for subsequent molecules to join \u2013 the last binds much faster than the first. The release of oxygen follows the opposite pattern, becoming progressively more difficult. A significant detail is the environment within the lungs, where inhaled oxygen enters the red blood cells by diffusion, constantly replenishing the free oxygen and maintaining a steep concentration gradient for continuous oxygen absorption. Conversely, in body tissues, where oxygen levels are lower, oxygen leaves the red blood cells and diffuses into the body cells. At rest or during mild exercise, typically only 25% of the oxygen carried is released into the cells, reserving the rest for periods of intense activity. The affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen is such that small environmental changes in oxygen levels can significantly influence blood oxygen saturation. In the lungs, haemoglobin quickly absorbs oxygen, and in body tissues, rapid oxygen release occurs as environmental oxygen saturation drops, as depicted in fig C oxygen dissociation curve.\n\n@@@EXAM HINT\nIt is crucial always to use suitable scientific terms during exams as it aids in sharpening the clarity of responses.\n\n@@@TRANSPORT OF CARBON DIOXIDE\nWaste carbon dioxide, a byproduct of cellular respiration, moves from body tissues to the blood through diffusion. The reaction of carbon dioxide with water is a pivotal step: carbon dioxide, when dissolved in blood, react with water to produce carbonic acid (H2CO3), which in turn separates into hydrogen ions (H+) and hydrogencarbonate ions (HCO3\u2013). A small percentage (about 5%) of carbon dioxide is dissolved in the plasma, while 10-20% binds with haemoglobin to form carbaminohaemoglobin. The majority of carbon dioxide is transported in the form of hydrogencarbonate ions within the red blood cells' cytoplasm. The reaction between carbon dioxide and water is expedited by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. In body tissues where carbon dioxide concentration is elevated, carbonic anhydrase accelerates the production of carbonic acid.\n\nPlease note that this text contains a statement indicating that it is an uncorrected proof and is subject to change at the publisher's discretion and is not for resale, circulation, or distribution in whole or in part, \u00a9Pearson 2018.","108":"@@@Meiosis and Genetic Variation: Chromatids Cross Over in Meiosis I\nDuring meiosis I, homologous pairs of chromosomes come together and pair up. The chromatids twist around each other and bits of chromatids swap over. The chromatids still contain the same genes but now have a different combination of alleles. Chromatids of one chromosome cross over occurs between chromatids. Chromatids now have a new combination of alleles.\n\n@@@Meiosis Produces Cells that are Genetically Different\nThere are two main events during meiosis that lead to genetic variation:\n\n1. Crossing over of chromatids: The crossing over of chromatids in meiosis I means that each of the four daughter cells formed from meiosis contains chromatids with different alleles. The chromosomes of homologous pairs come together during MEIOSIS I as chromatids cross over. One chromosome from each homologous pair ends up in each cell. Each cell has a different chromatid and therefore a different set of alleles, which increases genetic variation.\n\n2. Independent segregation of chromosomes: \n   - Each homologous pair of chromosomes in your cells is made up of one chromosome from your mum (maternal) and one chromosome from your dad (paternal).\n   - When the homologous pairs are separated in meiosis I, it's completely random which chromosome from each pair ends up in which daughter cell.\n   - So the four daughter cells produced by meiosis have completely different combinations of those maternal and paternal chromosomes. This is called independent segregation (separation) of the chromosomes.\n   - This 'shuffling' of chromosomes leads to genetic variation in any potential offspring. The diagram under MEIOSIS shows paternal and maternal chromosomes with possible combinations in daughter cells.\n\n@@@Meiosis Has a Different Outcome to Mitosis\nYou may remember mitosis from page 32. Mitosis and meiosis have different outcomes:\n\nOutcomes:\n- Mitosis produces cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Daughter cells are genetically identical to each other and to the parent cell. It produces two daughter cells.\n- Meiosis produces cells with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Daughter cells are genetically different from one another and the parent cell. It produces four daughter cells.\n\nYou need to be able to explain the different outcomes of mitosis and meiosis. They're different because mitosis only involves one division (which separates the sister chromatids) whereas meiosis has two divisions (which separate the homologous pairs and then the sister chromatids). There's no pairing or separating of homologous chromosomes in mitosis, and so no crossing over or independent segregation of chromosomes. This produces genetically identical daughter cells \u2014 unlike meiosis. Topic 4B \u2014 Diversity, Classification and Variation","109":"@@@Transport in Plants \u2014 Phloem\n\nNext up, it\u2019s time to look at phloem. I know, I almost can\u2019t contain my excitement. When it comes to the phloem it\u2019s all about moving dissolved organic substances around the plant, so it\u2019s a bit different to xylem.\n\n@@@Phloem Tissue is Adapted for Transporting Solutes\n\n1) Solutes are dissolved substances. Phloem tissue transports solutes (mainly sugars like sucrose) round plants. Like xylem, phloem is formed from cells arranged in tubes.\n\n2) Sieve tube elements and companion cells are important cell types in phloem tissue:\n\u2022 Sieve tube elements are living cells that form the tube for transporting solutes. They have no nucleus and few organelles, so...\n\u2022 ...there\u2019s a companion cell for each sieve tube element. They carry out living functions for sieve cells, e.g., providing the energy needed for the active transport of solutes.\n\n@@@Translocation is the Movement of Solutes\n\n1) Translocation is the movement of solutes (e.g., sugars like sucrose, and amino acids) to where they\u2019re needed in a plant. Solutes are sometimes called assimilates.\n\n2) It\u2019s an energy-requiring process that happens in the phloem.\n\n3) Translocation moves solutes from 'sources' to 'sinks'. The source of a solute is where it\u2019s made (so it\u2019s at a high concentration there). The sink is the area where it\u2019s used up (so it\u2019s at a lower concentration there).\n\nE.g., the source for sucrose is usually the leaves (where it\u2019s made), and the sinks are the other parts of the plant, especially the food storage organs and the meristems (areas of growth) in the roots, stems, and leaves.\n\n4) Enzymes maintain a concentration gradient from the source to the sink by changing the solutes at the sink (e.g., by breaking them down or making them into something else). This makes sure there\u2019s always a lower concentration at the sink than at the source.\n\nE.g., in potatoes, sucrose is converted to starch in the sink areas, so there\u2019s always a lower concentration of sucrose at the sink than inside the phloem. This makes sure a constant supply of new sucrose reaches the sink from the phloem.\n\n@@@The Mass Flow Hypothesis Best Explains Phloem Transport\n\nScientists still aren\u2019t certain exactly how the solutes are transported from source to sink by translocation. The best supported theory is the mass flow hypothesis:\n\n1) Active transport (see p. 42) is used to actively load the solutes (e.g., sucrose from photosynthesis) from companion cells into the sieve tubes of the phloem at the source (e.g., the leaves).\n\n2) This lowers the water potential inside the sieve tubes, so water enters the tubes by osmosis from the xylem and companion cells.\n\n3) This creates a high pressure inside the sieve tubes at the source end of the phloem.\n\n1) At the sink end, solutes are removed from the phloem to be used up.\n\n2) This increases the water potential inside the sieve tubes, so water also leaves the tubes by osmosis.\n\n3) This lowers the pressure inside the sieve tubes.\n\n(j) SOURCE\nlow water potential, high pressure\nwater flow solute flow\n\u00a9sieve plate plasmodesma\u2014Water flows to xylem\n\n(2) SINK \nhigh water potential, low pressure\n\n1) The result is a pressure gradient from the source end to the sink end.\n\nExperiments have shown that some sucrose is transported also through the cell walls of the phloem.\n\nThe higher the concentration of sucrose at the source, the higher the rate of translocation.\n\n1) The result is a pressure gradient from the source end to the sink end. This gradient pushes solutes along the sieve tubes towards the sink. \n\n2) When they reach the sink the solutes will be used (e.g., in respiration) or stored (e.g., as starch).\n\n@@@Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n\n[Graphic representation of the sieve plate and companion cell detailing the thin layer of cytoplasm and the direction of solute (e.g., sucrose) movement is implied but not provided in the original text.]","110":"@@@RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE\nCardiovascular health and risk can be assessed through various factors. One element is age, as shown by a Jordanian study in 2017 that illustrates the proportion of adults with coronary artery disease (CAD) based on age categories: under 45, 45\u201354, 55\u201364, and over 65. The study further highlights the impact of smoking on the prevalence of CAD, underscoring that individuals who smoke tend to show a higher proportion of CAD compared to non-smokers. Both male and female smokers are represented to demonstrate how smoking correlates with an increased risk of having CAD across different age groups, as depicted in Figure B.\n\n@@@INACTIVITY AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES (CVDs)\nPhysical inactivity poses a significant risk for developing atherosclerosis and CVDs. Regular exercise is beneficial as it helps lower blood pressure, prevents obesity and diabetes, reduces blood cholesterol levels, balances lipoproteins, and diminishes stress levels. A study involving 10,269 male Harvard University graduates aged between 45 and 84 indicated that those who took up regular exercise reduced their mortality by 23% over the study period compared to those who remained inactive. Atherosclerosis and linked CVDs were the primary causes of death. Additionally, a study of 72,488 female nurses showed that an active lifestyle corresponded with a significantly lower risk of developing atherosclerosis and other CVDs. A 2013 study from Sri Lanka associated high levels of inactivity with an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and CVDs, while increased activity levels corresponded with a reduced risk of these conditions. Furthermore, several studies suggest that exercise not only curtails the formation of arterial plaques but also stabilizes existing plaques, reducing the likelihood of their rupture.\n\n@@@HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nBlood pressure measurement serves as an indicator of cardiovascular health, changing rhythmically with the heart's beat and reflecting the condition of the heart and blood vessels. Healthy systolic blood pressure\u2014when the heart contracts\u2014is about 120 mmHg, while diastolic pressure\u2014when the heart refills\u2014is about 80 mmHg. Typically, blood pressure fluctuates during the day, but consistent readings above 140\/90 mmHg indicate hypertension. Persistently raised blood pressure could signal atherosclerosis, characterized by less flexible arterial walls and narrowing of the arteries due to plaque accumulation, which in turn increases blood pressure. Therefore, blood pressure assessment can aid in diagnosing atherosclerosis. Figure C shows a blood pressure monitor, which doctors use to ensure blood pressure is within a healthy range. Some individuals opt to purchase their own monitors to regularly check their blood pressure, a proactive measure to stave off CVDs.\n\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Don't worry \u2014 it's not evil stuff, but I promise to do my evil laugh. Mwah ha hah.\n\n@@@Transformed Organisms and Genetic Engineering\nTransformed Organisms Are Made Using Recombinant DNA Technology. Microorganisms, plants and animals can all be transformed using recombinant DNA technology. This is called genetic engineering. Transformed microorganisms can be made using the same technology as in vivo cloning (see page 199). For example, foreign DNA can be inserted into microorganisms to produce lots of useful protein, e.g., insulin. Transformed organisms are also known as genetically engineered or genetically modified (GM) organisms.\n\n@@@Creating Transformed Plants and Animals\nTransformed plants can also be produced. A gene that codes for a desirable protein is inserted into a plasmid. The plasmid is added to a bacterium, and the bacterium is used as a vector to get the gene into the plant cells. If the right promoter region has been added along with the gene (see p. 199), the transformed cells will be able to produce the desired protein. Transformed animals can be produced too \u2014 a gene that codes for a desirable protein can be inserted into an early animal embryo or into the egg cells of a female. If the gene is inserted into a very early embryo, all the body cells of the resulting transformed animal will end up containing the gene. Inserting it into the egg cells means that when the female reproduces, all the cells of her offspring will contain the gene. Promoter regions that are only activated in specific cell types can be used to control exactly which of an animal's body cells the protein is produced in. If the protein is only produced in certain cells, it can be harvested more easily. Producing the protein in the wrong cells could also damage the organism.\n\n@@@Benefits of Recombinant DNA Technology for Humans\nRecombinant DNA Technology can be used to benefit humans. Transformed organisms (microorganisms, plants, and animals) can be used in a variety of ways. You need to be able to interpret information about how they are used. Here are some examples:\n\n@@@Applications in Agriculture\nAgriculture: Agricultural crops can be transformed so that they give higher yields or are more nutritious. This means these plants can be used to reduce the risk of famine and malnutrition. Crops can also be transformed to have pest resistance, so that fewer pesticides are needed. This reduces costs and any environmental problems associated with using pesticides. For example, Golden Rice is a variety of transformed rice. It contains one gene from a maize plant and one gene from a soil bacterium, which together enable the rice to produce beta-carotene. The beta-carotene is used by our bodies to produce vitamin A. Golden Rice is being developed to reduce vitamin A deficiency in areas where there's a shortage of dietary vitamin A, e.g., south Asia, Africa. Vitamin A deficiency is a big problem in these areas; e.g., up to 500,000 children per year worldwide go blind due to vitamin A deficiency.\n\n@@@Applications in Industry\nIndustry: Industrial processes often use biological catalysts (enzymes). These enzymes can be produced from transformed organisms so they can be produced in large quantities for less money, reducing costs. For example, chymosin (or rennin) is an enzyme used in cheese-making. It used to be made from rennet (a substance produced in the stomach of cows), but it can now be produced by transformed organisms. This means it can be made in large quantities, relatively cheaply and without killing any cows, making some cheese suitable for vegetarians.\n\n@@@Applications in Medicine\nMedicine: Many drugs and vaccines are produced by transformed organisms, using recombinant DNA technology. They can be made quickly, cheaply and in large quantities using this method. For example, insulin is used to treat Type 1 diabetes and used to come from animals (cow, horse or pig pancreases). This insulin wasn't human insulin, though, so it didn't work quite as well. Human insulin is now made from transformed microorganisms, using a cloned human insulin gene (see above).\n\n@@@Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\nTopic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies.","112":"@@@Planning an Experiment: Apparatus and Techniques\nYou Need to Know How to Use Apparatus and Techniques Correctly. Examiners could ask you about a whole range of different apparatus and techniques. Make sure you know how to use all the instruments and equipment you've come across in class and can carry out all the techniques too. Here are some examples of equipment you should be able to use: Measuring cylinders and graduated pipettes\u2014These have a scale so you can measure specific volumes. Whichever one you use, make sure you read the volume from the bottom of the meniscus when it's at eye level. Water baths\u2014Make sure you allow time for water baths to heat up before starting your experiment. Don't forget that your solutions will need time to get to the same temperature as the water before you start the experiment too. Also, remember to check the temperature of the water bath with a thermometer during the investigation to make sure it doesn't change. Data logger\u2014Decide what you are measuring and what type of data logger you will need, e.g., temperature, pH. Connect an external sensor to the data logger if you need to. Decide how often you want the data logger to take readings depending on the length of the process that you are measuring. Make sure you know how to do all the practical investigations described in this book. You should be able to apply the techniques described to different contexts. For example, page 113 describes how to use a colorimeter and a redox indicator dye to investigate the rate of dehydrogenase activity in chloroplasts. You could use a similar technique (i.e., a colorimeter and a redox indicator dye) to investigate the rate of respiration in yeast.\n\n@@@Conducting Risk Assessments for Safety\nRisk Assessments Help You to Work Safely. When you're planning an experiment, you need to carry out a risk assessment. To do this, you need to identify all the dangers in the experiment, e.g., any hazardous chemicals, microorganisms, or naked flames. Who is at risk from these dangers. What can be done to reduce the risk, such as wearing goggles or gloves or working in a fume cupboard. You also need to consider any ethical issues in your experiment. For example, if you're using living animals (e.g., insects) you must treat them with respect. This means handling them carefully and keeping them away from harmful chemicals, extreme heat sources, and other things that might cause them physical discomfort.\n\n@@@Recording and Interpreting Data\nRecord Your Data in a Table. It's a good idea to draw a table to record the results of your experiment in. When you draw a table, make sure you include enough rows and columns to record all of the data you need to. You might also need to include a column for processing your data (e.g. working out an average). Make sure each column has a heading so you know what's going to be recorded where. The units should be in the column heading, not the table itself. The independent variable should be recorded in the left-hand column and the dependent variable in the right. Watch Out for Anomalous Results. Doing repeats makes it easier to spot anomalous results. When you look at all the data in your table, you may notice that you have a result that doesn't seem to fit in with the rest at all. These results are called anomalous results. You should investigate anomalous results\u2014if you can work out what happened (e.g. you measured something totally wrong) you can ignore them when processing your results. However, you can't just ignore a result because you don't like the look of it. My best apparatus is the pommel horse... It's not really, I just like the word pommel. Scientists are rightfully fussy about methods and equipment\u2014I mean if you're going to bother doing an experiment, you should at least make sure it's going to give you results you can trust.\n\n@@@Reflection on Practical Skills\nPractical Skills are essential, and scientists must be particular about methods and equipment. If the goal is to conduct experiments that yield reliable and trustworthy results, then meticulous preparation and use of equipment are non-negotiable. The playful mention of a pommel horse highlights the importance of familiarizing oneself with the correct terminology and tools in any scientific endeavor.","113":"@@@Transport in Plants \u2014 Xylem\nTransport in plants isn't really roads and railways, but it's a bit like a flowing river that's carrying stuff around in a network of tubes. When you consider the movement of water, it's all about the xylem. It's pretty exciting stuff...\n\n@@@Two Types of Tissue are Involved in Transport in Plants\n1) Xylem tissue transports water and mineral ions in solution. These substances move up the plant from the roots to the leaves. 2) Phloem tissue transports organic substances like sugars (also in solution) both up and down the plant \u2014 there's more about the phloem on pages 80-81. 3) Xylem and phloem are mass transport systems (see page 54) \u2014 they move substances over large distances. Xylem vessels are the part of the xylem tissue that actually transports the water and ions. Xylem vessels are very long, tube-like structures formed from dead cells (vessel elements) joined end to end. There are no end walls on these cells, making an uninterrupted tube that allows water to pass up through the middle easily.\n\n@@@Water Moves Up a Plant Against the Force of Gravity\nCohesion and tension help water move up plants, from roots to leaves, against the force of gravity.\n1) Water evaporates from the leaves at the 'top' of the xylem (this is transpiration \u2014 see below).\n2) This creates tension (suction), which pulls more water into the leaf. \n3) Water molecules are cohesive (they stick together \u2014 see page 21) so when some are pulled into the leaf, others follow. This means the whole column of water in the xylem moves upwards.\n4) Water enters the stem through the roots.\n\n@@@Transpiration is Loss of Water from a Plant\u2019s Surface\nTranspiration is the evaporation of water from a plant's surface, especially the leaves.\n1) Water evaporates from the moist cell walls and accumulates in the spaces between cells in the leaf.\n2) When the stomata open (see page 57), it moves out of the leaf down the concentration gradient (there's more water inside the leaf than in the air outside).\nTranspiration is really a side effect of photosynthesis \u2014 the plant needs to open its stomata to let in CO2 so that it can produce glucose, but this also lets water out.\n\n@@@Four Main Factors Affect Transpiration Rate\n1) Light \u2014 the lighter it is, the faster the transpiration rate (i.e., there's a positive correlation between light intensity and transpiration rate). This is because the stomata open when it gets light to let in CO2 for photosynthesis. When it's dark the stomata are usually closed, so there's little transpiration.\n2) Temperature \u2014 the higher the temperature, the faster the transpiration rate. Warmer water molecules have more energy so they evaporate from the cells inside the leaf faster. This increases the concentration gradient between the inside and outside of the leaf, making water diffuse out of the leaf faster.\n3) Humidity \u2014 the lower the humidity, the faster the transpiration rate (i.e., there's a negative correlation between humidity and transpiration rate). If the air around the plant is dry, the concentration gradient between the leaf and the air is increased, which increases transpiration.\n4) Wind \u2014 the windier it is, the faster the transpiration rate. Lots of air movement blows away water molecules from around the stomata. This increases the concentration gradient, which increases the rate of transpiration.","114":"@@@THE MAMMALIAN HEART\nMAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS 42 1B.4 THE MAMMALIAN HEART\nThe action of the heart is a critical component to understand within mammalian transport systems. In the biological context, it's key to recall that blood flows through both sides of the heart simultaneously\u2014this is an often-tested concept on exams. Blood delivery, atrial and ventricular action, and the role of the heart's valves are pivotal in this process.\n\n1 The inferior vena cava is responsible for gathering deoxygenated blood from the lower body regions, while the superior vena cava collects it from the head, neck, arms, and chest, directing it all to the right atrium. \n\n2 As the right atrium fills with blood from the great veins, the rising pressure opens the tricuspid valve, allowing the right ventricle to begin filling. Full atrial contraction follows, pushing additional blood into the ventricle. The atrium's thin muscular walls are structurally suitable for the low-pressure blood receipt from the vena cavas, while also sufficiently moving blood into the ventricle. Semilunar valves in this region act to prevent any blood from flowing backward into the veins. \n\n3 The tricuspid valve, with its three flap structure\u2014also known as an atrioventricular valve\u2014facilitates blood movement from the atrium to the ventricle while preventing reverse flow. Tough tendinous cords, or the heartstrings, ensure the valve remains intact against the ventricular contraction pressure.\n\n4 Subsequent to right atrial contraction which propels blood into the ventricle under pressure, the right ventricle contracts. Its muscular walls generate the necessary force to drive blood through the pulmonary arteries to the lung capillaries. This contraction coincides with the closing of the tricuspid valve to block atrial backflow, and semilunar valves impede arterial blood from re-entering the ventricle.\n\n5 Deoxygenated blood is returned to the left side of the heart at a relatively low pressure after passing through lung capillaries via the pulmonary veins. The left atrium operates similarly to the right, receiving the blood and contracting to push it into the left ventricle, safeguarded against backflow by a second atrioventricular valve \u2013 the bicuspid valve, which has two flaps.\n\n6 During left atrial contraction, the bicuspid valve permits blood under pressure to enter the left ventricle; when the ventricle contracts, this valve closes to prevent backflow. The blood is then expelled into the aorta, the main artery distributing blood at high pressure throughout the body. The left heart wall is notably more muscular to supply the force needed to propel the blood over greater distances and to counter arterial elastic recoil, with semilunar valves ensuring no backflow into the ventricle.\n\n@@@ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS INTO HEART FUNCTION AND DEVELOPMENT\nLEARNING TIP: Valve functioning within the heart is directly influenced by changing blood pressure across different chambers; they open and close accordingly. The septum, a substantial muscular and connective tissue barrier between the heart's halves, plays a crucial role by preventing oxygenated and deoxygenated blood from mixing.\n\nDID YOU KNOW? A feature unique to fetal development is the foramen ovale, a septal opening allowing blood mixing between the heart's sides, which is non-detrimental as fetal lungs do not process blood. Post-birth, this opening should seal as pulmonary function begins. A failure to seal results in a condition known as patent foramen ovale or 'hole in the heart', which if significant, requires surgical intervention.\n\nDID YOU KNOW? The heart's internal complexity is often underestimated. The typical depiction simplifies its structure considerably. Through dissection, as seen in mammals like sheep or cows, the intricate relations between vessels, chambers, and valve structures are revealed, demonstrating the heart's function as a multidimensional pump.","115":"@@@Introduction to Cardiovascular Disease\nDiseases associated with your heart and blood vessels are called cardiovascular diseases (cardio = heart, vascular = blood vessels \u2014 geddit?). There are certain factors that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.\n\n@@@The Process of Atheroma Formation in Cardiovascular Disease\nMost Cardiovascular Disease Starts with Atheroma Formation:\n1) The wall of an artery is made up of several layers (see p. 70).\n2) The endothelium (inner lining) is usually smooth and unbroken.\n3) If damage occurs to the endothelium (e.g. by high blood pressure) white blood cells (mostly macrophages) and lipids (fat) from the blood clump together under the lining to form fatty streaks.\n4) Over time, more white blood cells, lipids, and connective tissue build up and harden to form a fibrous plaque called an atheroma.\n5) This plaque partially blocks the lumen of the artery and restricts blood flow, which causes blood pressure to increase.\n6) Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a type of cardiovascular disease. It occurs when the coronary arteries have lots of atheromas in them, which restricts blood flow to the heart muscle. It can lead to myocardial infarction (see below).\n\n@@@Complications Arising from Atheroma: Aneurysm and Thrombosis\nAtheromas Increase the Risk of Aneurysm and Thrombosis:\nTwo types of disease that affect the arteries are:\nAneurysm \u2014 a balloon-like swelling of the artery.\n1) Atheroma plaques damage and weaken arteries. They also narrow arteries, increasing blood pressure.\n2) When blood travels through a weakened artery at high pressure, it may push the inner layers of the artery through the outer elastic layer to form a balloon-like swelling \u2014 an aneurysm.\n3) This aneurysm may burst, causing a hemorrhage (bleeding).\nThrombosis \u2014 formation of a blood clot.\n1) An atheroma plaque can rupture (burst through) the endothelium (inner lining) of an artery.\n2) This damages the artery wall and leaves a rough surface.\n3) Platelets and fibrin (a protein) accumulate at the site of damage and form a blood clot (a thrombus).\n4) This blood clot can cause a complete blockage of the artery or it can become dislodged and block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body.\n5) Debris from the rupture can cause another blood clot to form further down the artery.\n\n@@@Myocardial Infarction as a Result of Interrupted Blood Flow\nInterrupted Blood Flow to the Heart can Cause a Myocardial Infarction:\n1) The heart muscle is supplied with blood by the coronary arteries.\n2) This blood contains the oxygen needed by heart muscle cells to carry out respiration.\n3) If a coronary artery becomes completely blocked (e.g. by a blood clot) an area of the heart muscle will be totally cut off from its blood supply, receiving no oxygen.\n4) This causes a myocardial infarction \u2014 more commonly known as a heart attack.\n5) A heart attack can cause damage and death of the heart muscle.\n6) Symptoms include pain in the chest and upper body, shortness of breath, and sweating.\n7) If large areas of the heart are affected complete heart failure can occur, which is often fatal.\n\n@@@Visual Representation of Atheroma and Aneurysm\naneurysm\nnormal artery\nthick muscle* layer\ndeposits of fatty material, dead cells, white blood cells, and connective tissue\ndeposits of fatty material etc. build up and push out endothelium to form an atheroma\nlumen (space in center)\nendothelium\nlumen shrinks as artery wall swells, so it's more difficult for blood to pass through\n\n@@@Topic Heading for Further Discussion\nTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems","116":"@@@MAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nMAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS 46 1B.5 ATHEROSCLEROSIS can become a chronic condition that may require significant medical intervention to solve a severe problem permanently. A small tube called a stent may be inserted into the coronary arteries to hold them open, or heart bypass surgery may be carried out. \u25b2 fig D Injecting the blood vessels with special dye allows doctors to see where the coronary arteries are narrowing due to atherosclerosis so they can treat the problem.\n\n@@@EXAM HINT FOR UNDERSTANDING ANGINA AND MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION\nEXAM HINT: Be clear that angina and myocardial infarction are caused by reduced blood flow to the cardiac muscle \u2013 if you say \u2018to the heart\u2019 this suggests reduced flow in the veins carrying blood into the atria rather than arteries carrying oxygenated blood to the muscle itself. In a myocardial infarction, often called a heart attack, one of the branches of the coronary artery becomes completely blocked and part of the heart muscle is permanently starved of oxygen.\n\n@@@CAUSES OF HEART ATTACKS AND THE ROLE OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nMany heart attacks are caused by a blood clot resulting from atherosclerosis. As you have seen, the wall of an artery affected by a plaque is stiffened, making it much more likely to suffer cracks or damage. Platelets touch the damaged surface of the plaque and the clotting process is triggered (see Section 1B.2). The plaque itself may rupture and break open, and the cholesterol that is released will also cause the platelets to trigger the blood clotting process. A clot may also develop because the endothelial lining is damaged, for example by high blood pressure or smoking. A clot that forms in a blood vessel is known as a thrombosis. The clot can rapidly block the whole blood vessel, particularly if it is already narrowed by a plaque. A clot that gets stuck in a coronary artery is known as a coronary thrombosis. The clot can block the artery, starving the heart muscle beyond that point of oxygen and nutrients, and this often leads to a heart attack (see fig E). Blargest heart attack (cardiac arrest) follows if blockage is at C medium heart attack \u2013 death of some heart tissue if blockage is at Bsmall heart attack \u2013 death of small amount of heart tissue if blockage is at AABC \u25b2 fig E The size and severity of a heart attack is closely related to the position of the blockage in the coronary artery. \n\n@@@SYMPTOMS OF A HEART ATTACK AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\nDuring a heart attack, there is chest pain in the same areas as in an angina attack, but it is much more severe. The pain may occur at any time, although exercise may start it, and it often lasts for several hours. Death may occur very rapidly with no previous symptoms, or it may happen after several days of feeling tired and suffering symptoms mistaken for indigestion. It is very important to react quickly if you suspect someone is having a heart attack. Give them two full-strength aspirin tablets to help stop the blood clotting, and get them to the hospital as fast as you can.\n\n@@@STROKES AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE BRAIN\nSTROKES: A stroke is caused by an interruption to the normal blood supply to an area of the brain. This may be due to bleeding from damaged capillaries or a blockage cutting off the blood supply to the brain. A blockage is usually caused by a blood clot, an atheroma or a combination of the two. Sometimes, the blood clot forms somewhere else in the body and is carried in the bloodstream until it gets stuck in an artery in the brain. The damage happens very quickly. A blockage in one of the main arteries leading to the brain causes a very serious stroke that may lead to death. In one of the smaller arterioles leading into the brain, the effects may be less disastrous. The symptoms of strokes vary, depending on how much of the brain is affected. Very often, the blood is cut off from one part or one side of the brain only (see fig F). Symptoms include dizziness, confusion, slurred speech, blurred vision or partial loss of vision (usually one eye) and numbness. In more severe strokes, there can be paralysis, usually on one side of the body. Uncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

The learning objectives include:\n- Understanding the link between dietary antioxidants and the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n- Being able to distinguish between correlation and causation and recognize conflicting evidence.\n\n@@@DIETARY HABITS AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK\nYour diet is not all about the fats you eat. Lots of studies show that eating lots of fruit and vegetables benefits your health in many ways \u2013 including reducing your risk of developing CVDs. The graph in fig A is one piece of evidence which shows how eating five or more portions of fruit or vegetables a day can lower your risk of having a heart attack. It was based on data from a longitudinal study of more than 84,000 women and 42,000 men over eight years, looking at their fruit and vegetable intake and cardiac health.\n\n\u25b2 fig A This graph shows the impact of eating increasing amounts of fruit and vegetables on the risk for coronary heart disease. Remember to look closely at the data you are given. This graph shows the relative risk of developing coronary heart disease compared to a person eating fewer than three servings of fruit and vegetables per day. The significance of this evidence is highlighted, reminding readers to pay attention to given data.\n\n@@@ANTIOXIDANTS AND HEART HEALTH\nHowever, as you know, it isn\u2019t enough to show a correlation between two things. We need to show how one thing causes another and we still don\u2019t really know how fruit and vegetables have their effect. They are very varied in their chemistry. For some time, it was thought that the antioxidants found in fruit and vegetables might be the answer. Vitamins, such as vitamin A found in carrots, vitamin C from citrus fruits, and vitamin E from leafy green vegetables, almonds, and sunflower oil, are antioxidants and they are found in fruits and vegetables. Several studies appeared to show that antioxidants were the answer and many people started taking antioxidant supplements to protect their hearts. However, recent studies, including some very large metadata analyses (studies where scientists have looked at the results of many different investigations), have shown that the evidence for antioxidants being good for your heart is inconclusive. There is some evidence that some antioxidants may cause harm.\n\n@@@VITAMIN C: A CASE STUDY\nVitamin C is important in the formation of connective tissue in the body, such as in the bones, teeth, skin, and many internal body surfaces including the endothelial lining of blood vessels. A severe lack of vitamin C in the diet causes scurvy, which can result in bleeding gums, bruising easily, and painful joints. As you have seen, if the lining of an artery is damaged, atherosclerosis is more likely to develop. So, it makes sense, in theory, that if your diet is low in vitamin C, your arteries are more likely to be damaged and you are more likely to be affected by CVD.\n\nA study published in the British Medical Journal in 1997 looked at the association between concentration of vitamin C in the blood and risk of heart attack in 1605 men from eastern Finland. The men had no sign of coronary artery disease when they were tested between 1984 and 1989. Their vitamin C levels were also tested. Between 1984 and 1992 a total of 70 of the men had a heart attack. The study's findings contribute to understanding the role of Vitamin C in cardiovascular health.\n\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

If business expansion goes ahead just before a long economic recession, then the additional cost of borrowing can destroy a business as it will probably not be able to increase its sales. However, the ability to spot and exploit a gap in a fast-growing economy can lead to high profits. It is, therefore, misleading to think just of \u2018economic constraints\u2019 on business activity as the country\u2019s economic performance can just as easily enable a business to take advantage of great new opportunities. Governments have objectives for the nation\u2019s economy. In pursuing these objectives, governments take economic policy decisions that can have a significant impact on the success and profitability of businesses. Understanding these objectives and these policies is important to managers who plan to protect their organisation from negative policy changes and to position their business to take advantage of positive policy changes.\n\n@@@Economic Objectives of Governments and Conflicting Goals\nAll governments set targets for the whole economy and these are referred to as \u2018macro-economic\u2019 objectives. These are likely to include: economic growth \u2013 the annual percentage increase in a country\u2019s total level of output (known as gross domestic product or GDP), low price inflation \u2013 the rate at which consumer prices, on average, increase each year, low rate of unemployment, a long-term balance of payments between the value of goods and services bought from other countries (imports) and the value of the goods and services the country sells to other countries (exports), exchange rate stability \u2013 the government will try to prevent wild swings in the external value of the currency in terms of its price compared with other currencies, and wealth and income transfers to reduce inequalities. Some governments \u2013 but not necessarily all \u2013 attempt to reduce extreme inequalities of personal income and wealth, usually by using the tax system.\n\nUnfortunately, several of these objectives may conflict with each other. This means that in trying to achieve one of these targets above, the government could actually make it less likely that one or more of the others will be achieved. For example, if it is believed that the rate of inflation is too high, then policies might be followed to reduce spending. This will lead to lower demand \u2013 and result in increased unemployment. We now look in detail at each of these objectives and why they are considered to be desirable. Then we consider the policies governments can use to try to achieve these objectives.\n\nTOP TIP: Start to keep your own file of newspaper articles on economic events and data and how businesses are responding to changes in these.\n\n@@@Understanding Economic Growth and Its Desirability\nEconomic growth means that a country is becoming richer. It is measured by increases in gross domestic product (GDP). Economic growth: an increase in a country\u2019s productive potential measured by an increase in its real GDP. Gross domestic product (GDP): the total value of goods and services produced in a country in one year \u2013 real GDP has been adjusted for inflation.\n\nKEY TERMS: GDP is measured in monetary terms, and inflation will raise the value of GDP. Such an increase is not true economic growth. Economic growth in the economy occurs when the real level of GDP rises as a result of increases in the physical output of goods and services in an economy. Every economy is striving to achieve consistent economic growth \u2013 some with more success than others. For example, annual real GDP growth varied in the USA from 3% to \u20132% between 2008 and 2013. Over the same period, GDP rose by an average of 8% in China and exceeded 10% in 2008. Negative economic growth or a recession is when GDP falls; this occurred in Zimbabwe in 2008 (\u201313%) and in 2013 the Italian economy was 8% smaller than it had been in 2008.\n\nEconomic growth is important to a country for several reasons: Higher real GDP increases average living standards if the population increases at a slower rate. Higher levels of output often lead to increased employment, which will increase consumer incomes.","119":"@@@Global Trade Blocs and the Challenge of Competitive Advantage\nMembers of the European Union (EU) also trade freely among themselves, but the EU is more than a free-trade bloc. This organisation is covered in more detail later in the book. The danger with these blocs is that they may agree to impose trade barriers on other groups of countries in order to attempt to gain competitive advantage against imports from these other groups.\n\n@@@The Rise of Multinational Businesses in the Global Economy\nMultinational firms have benefited greatly from the freedoms offered by globalisation. They are more than just importers and exporters; they actually produce goods and services in more than one country. The biggest multinationals have annual revenues exceeding the size of many countries\u2019 entire economies. This sheer size \u2013 and the power and influence it can bring \u2013 can lead to many problems for nations that deal with such firms. This point is made more obvious by the fact that many multinationals have their head offices in Western European countries or in the USA, yet have many of their operating bases in less-developed countries with much smaller economies. If the companies need to save costs by reducing the size of their workforces, often the last countries to lose jobs will be the ones where the head offices are based. KEY TERM: Multinational business: business organisation that has its headquarters in one country, but with operating branches, factories and assembly plants in other countries. TOP TIP: When defining a multinational business, it is not enough to state that such businesses \u2018sell products in more than one country\u2019.\n\n@@@Incentives and Challenges for Becoming a Multinational\nThere are several reasons why businesses start to operate in countries other than their main base. 1. Closer to main markets \u2013 this will have a number of advantages, such as lower transport costs for the finished goods, better market information about consumer tastes as a result of operating closer to them, and it may be viewed as a local company and gain customer loyalty as a consequence. 2. Lower costs of production \u2013 apart from lower transport costs of the completed items, there are likely to be other cost savings, such as lower labour rates, cheaper rent and site costs, and government grants and tax incentives designed to encourage the industrialisation of such countries. 3. Avoid import restrictions \u2013 by producing in the local country there will be no import duties to pay and no other import restrictions. 4. Access to local natural resources \u2013 these might not be available in the company\u2019s main operating country; see Activity 6.2.\n\n@@@Potential Issues Encountered by Multinationals\nSetting up operating plants in foreign countries is not without risks. Communication links with headquarters may be poor. Language, legal and culture differences with local workers and government officials could lead to misunderstandings. Coordination with other plants in the multinational group will need to be carefully monitored to ensure that products that might compete with each other on world markets are not produced or that conflicting policies are not adopted. Finally, it is likely that the skill levels of the local employees will be low and this could require substantial investment in training programmes.\n\n@@@Coca-Cola\u2019s Global Operations and Strategic Partnerships\nGlobal reach of Coca-Cola: Coca-Cola is a global business that operates in more than 200 countries. It claims to operate on \u2018a local scale in every community where we do business\u2019. It is able to create global reach with local resources because of the strength of the Coca-Cola system, which comprises the main company and its bottling partners around the world \u2013 nearly 300 of them, which are not owned by Coca-Cola.

[10] 636: Business structure","120":"@@@ATHEROSCLEROSIS AND THE MAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS\nOnce damage to the endothelium has occurred, the body\u2019s inflammatory response begins and white blood cells arrive at the site of the damage. These cells accumulate chemicals from the blood, especially cholesterol. This leads to a plaque (also known as an atheroma) forming on the endothelial lining of the artery (see fig C). Fibrous tissue and calcium salts also build up (increase in amount) around the atheroma, turning it into a hardened plaque. This hardened area means that part of the artery wall is less elastic and narrower than it should be. This is atherosclerosis and is summarised in fig B. The plaque causes the lumen of the artery to become much smaller. This increases the blood pressure, making it harder for the heart to pump blood around the body. The raised blood pressure makes damage more likely in other areas of the endothelial lining and more plaques will form. This will make the blood pressure even higher, and so the problem gets worse. There are many factors that are linked to the development of atherosclerosis. You will look at these in more detail in Chapter 1C.\n\n@@@EFFECT OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS ON HEALTH\nAtherosclerosis can have many serious effects on the health of an individual. The development of atherosclerosis can be summarised as: damage to the endothelium of the arteries \u2192 inflammatory response \u2192 accumulation of cholesterol \u2192 atheroma \u2192 fibrous tissue\/calcium salts \u2192 plaque \u2192 narrowing\/loss of elasticity of the artery.\n\n@@@ANEURYSMS CAUSED BY ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nIf an area of an artery is narrowed by plaque, blood tends to collect behind the blockage. The artery bulges and the wall is put under more pressure than usual, so it becomes weakened. This is known as an aneurysm. The weakened artery wall may split open, leading to massive internal bleeding. Aneurysms frequently happen in the blood vessels supplying the brain or in the aorta, especially when it passes through the abdomen. The massive blood loss and drop in blood pressure are often fatal, but if aneurysms are diagnosed they can be treated by surgery before they burst.\n\n@@@CONSEQUENCES OF RAISED BLOOD PRESSURE DUE TO ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nThe arteries narrowed due to plaques on the walls cause raised blood pressure. This can lead to severe damage in a number of organs, including the kidneys, the eyes, and the brain. The high pressure damages the tiny blood vessels where your kidney filters out urea and other substances from the blood. If the vessels feeding the kidney tubules become narrowed, the pressure inside them gets even higher and proteins may be forced out through their walls. If you have high blood pressure, your doctors can test for protein in your urine as a sign of kidney damage. Similarly, the tiny blood vessels supplying the retina of your eye are easily damaged. If they become blocked or leak, the retinal cells are starved of oxygen and die and this can cause blindness. Bleeding from the capillaries into the brain results in one type of stroke (see below).\n\n@@@IMPACT OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS ON HEART DISEASE\nThere are many kinds of heart disease, but the two most common ones are angina and myocardial infarction (heart attack); both are closely linked to atherosclerosis (see figs B and D). In angina, plaques build up slowly in the coronary arteries, reducing blood flow to the parts of the heart muscle beyond the plaques. Often symptoms are first noticed during exercise, when the cardiac muscle is working harder and needs more oxygen. The narrowed coronary arteries cannot supply enough oxygenated blood and the heart muscle resorts to anaerobic respiration. This causes a gripping pain in the chest that can extend into the arms, particularly the left one, and the jaw, and often also causes breathlessness. The symptoms of angina subside once exercise stops, but the experience is painful and frightening. Fortunately, most angina is relatively mild. It can be helped by taking regular exercise, losing weight, and not smoking. The symptoms can be treated by drugs that cause rapid dilation of the coronary blood vessels so that they supply the cardiac muscle with the oxygen it needs. However, if the blockage of the coronary arteries continues to get worse, so will the symptoms of the angina. Other drugs are then used to dilate the blood vessels and reduce the heart rate. Unfortunately, drugs cannot\n\n@@@STUDY ADVICE - UNDERSTANDING ATHEROSCLEROSIS-RELATED TERMS\n\u25b2 fig C Fatty deposits like these in an artery cause disease and death in millions of people every year.

This is not always achieved \u2013 especially if the management fail to recognise the different cultures that exist in other countries. This is explained in more detail in Chapter 21. Evaluation of the impact on \u2018host\u2019 countries of multinational operations. The potential benefits are clear: investment brings in foreign currency, employment opportunities along with training improve the efficiency of local people, local firms benefit from the supply chain, quality and productivity must rise to meet international standards, tax revenues from multinational profits enhance government income, management expertise improves in the community over time, and the total output of the economy increases GDP.\n\n@@@Disadvantages of Multinational Expansion\nHowever, it will not be all good news. The expansion of multinational corporations into a country could lead to drawbacks such as the exploitation of the local workforce in the absence of strict labor and health and safety rules, which may allow multinationals to employ cheap labor under poor conditions. There are also issues with pollution due to slack environmental regulations or government fear of driving away multinationals, the potential for local competing firms to be forced out of the market, accusations of cultural imposition from global brands like McDonald's and Coca-Cola, profits being repatriated back to the multinational's home country instead of being reinvested locally, and extensive depletion of limited natural resources by multinationals who have little incentive to conserve these resources.\n\n@@@Tips for Multinational Business Activity Case Studies\nIn case study questions on multinational business activity, you may have the opportunity to use examples from your own country along with the case study to support your answers. Keep a file of news reports about multinational business activities in your country. This information can provide valuable evidence and insights when discussing the impacts of multinational corporations.\n\n@@@Privatisation and Its Features\nThe policy of privatisation includes other features apart from the outright sale of state assets, such as state-owned schools, hospitals, and local authorities contracting out many services to private businesses. The main aspect of privatisation is the transfer of ownership of nationalised industries into the private sector by creating public limited companies. This policy began in the UK in the 1980s and is now widespread throughout most mixed economies. Businesses like British Airways, Deutsche Telekom, and Skoda are among the many that have been privatised in Europe. Supporters of privatisation argue that businesses operate more efficiently in the private sector due to the profit motive, while opponents believe the state can pursue objectives besides profit in public-sector enterprises and that privatisation often leads to job losses as a result of cost-cutting measures. Privatisation is defined as selling state-owned and controlled business organisations to investors in the private sector.","122":"@@@Control of Blood Glucose Concentration\nThese pages are all about how homeostasis sorts out your blood glucose level so you can keep revising. Eating and Exercise Change the Concentration of Glucose in your Blood. All cells need a constant energy supply to work \u2014 so blood glucose concentration must be carefully controlled. The concentration of glucose in the blood is normally around 90 mg per 100 cm3 of blood. It's monitored by cells in the pancreas. Blood glucose concentration rises after eating food containing carbohydrate. Blood glucose concentration falls after exercise, as more glucose is used in respiration to release energy.\n\n@@@Insulin and Glucagon Control Blood Glucose Concentration\nThe hormonal system controls blood glucose concentration using two hormones called insulin and glucagon. Like all hormones, insulin and glucagon travel in the blood to their target cells (effectors). They're both secreted by clusters of cells in the pancreas called the islets of Langerhans: Alpha cells secrete glucagon into the blood. Insulin and glucagon act on effectors, which respond to restore the blood glucose concentration to the normal level.\n\n@@@The Mechanism of Insulin\nInsulin lowers blood glucose concentration when it's too high. Insulin binds to specific receptors on the cell membranes of liver cells and muscle cells. It increases the permeability of muscle-cell membranes to glucose, so the cells take up more glucose. This involves increasing the number of channel proteins in the cell membranes. Insulin also activates enzymes in liver and muscle cells that convert glucose into glycogen. The cells are able to store glycogen in their cytoplasm, as an energy source. The process of forming glycogen from glucose is called glycogenesis. Insulin also increases the rate of respiration of glucose, especially in muscle cells. Liver cells are also called Hepatocytes. GLYCOGEN.\n\n@@@The Mechanism of Glucagon\nGlucagon raises blood glucose concentration when it's too low. Glucagon binds to specific receptors on the cell membranes of liver cells. Glucagon activates enzymes in liver cells that break down glycogen into glucose. The process of breaking down glycogen is called glycogenolysis. Glucagon also activates enzymes that are involved in the formation of glucose from glycerol (a component of lipids) and amino acids. The process of forming glucose from non-carbohydrates is called gluconeogenesis. Glucagon decreases the rate of respiration of glucose in cells. Because they travel in the blood to their target cells, the responses produced by hormones are slower than those produced by nervous impulses (which are very quick \u2014 see page 129). Hormones are not broken down as quickly as neurotransmitters though, so their effects tend to last for longer.\n\n@@@Negative Feedback Mechanisms Keep Blood Glucose Concentration Normal\nBeta cells secrete insulin, pancreas detects blood glucose concentration is too high, alpha cells stop secreting glucagon, insulin binds to receptors on liver and muscle cells, cells take up more glucose, glycogenesis is activated, cells respire more glucose. 'Genesis' means making \u2014 so glycogenesis means making glycogen. The rise in blood glucose concentration, NORMAL BLOOD GLUCOSE CONCENTRATION, 'Lysis means splitting' \u2014 so glycogenolysis means splitting glycogen. Cells release glucose into the blood, glycogenolysis is activated, gluconeogenesis is activated, cells respire less glucose. The fall in blood glucose concentration, pancreas detects blood glucose concentration is too low, alpha cells secrete glucagon, glucagon binds to receptors on liver cells, beta cells stop secreting insulin.","123":"@@@INTRODUCTION TO RNA AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS\nProtein synthesis involves two stages \u2014 transcription and translation. They both involve RNA.\n\n@@@TYPES OF RNA\nThere\u2019s More Than One Type of RNA\nRemember, RNA is a single polynucleotide strand and it contains uracil (U) as a base instead of thymine (see p. 16). Uracil always pairs with adenine during protein synthesis. RNA isn't all the same though. You need to know about:\n\n@@@MESSENGER RNA (mRNA)\n(Messenger RNA (mRNA))mRNA is made during transcription (see below). It carries the genetic code from the DNA to the ribosomes, where it's used to make a protein during translation (see next page). mRNA is a single ^ Base polynucleotide strand.\nIn mRNA, groups of three adjacent bases are usually called codons (they're sometimes called triplets or base triplets). Ribose sugar codon\n\n@@@TRANSFER RNA (tRNA)\n(Transfer RNA (tRNA))tRNA is involved in translation. It carries the amino acids that are used to make proteins to the ribosomes. tRNA is a single polynucleotide strand that's folded into a clover shape. Hydrogen bonds between specific base pairs hold the molecule in this shape.\nEvery tRNA molecule has a specific sequence of three bases at one end called an anticodon. They also have an amino acid binding site at the other end. Anticodon Amino acid binding site Hydrogen bonds between base pairs\n\n@@@FIRST STAGE OF PROTEIN SYNTHESIS \u2014 TRANSCRIPTION\nFirst Stage of Protein Synthesis \u2014 Transcription\nDuring transcription, an mRNA copy of a gene is made from DNA.\nIn eukaryotic cells, transcription takes place in the nucleus. (Prokaryotes don't have a nucleus, so transcription takes place in the cytoplasm.) Transcription starts when RNA polymerase (an enzyme) attaches to the DNA double helix at the beginning of a gene.\nThe hydrogen bonds between the two DNA strands in the gene break, separating the strands, and the DNA molecule uncoils at that point, exposing some of the bases.\nOne of the strands is then used as a template to make an mRNA copy. \n\n1) Cytoplasm RNA polymerase Nucleus Template strand of DNA \n2) RNA nucleotides joined together nucleotides \n3) The RNA polymerase lines up free RNA nucleotides alongside the exposed bases on the template strand. The free bases are attracted to the exposed bases. Specific, complementary base pairing (see p. 17) means that the mRNA strand ends up being a complementary copy of the DNA template strand (except the base T is replaced by U in RNA).\n4) Once the RNA nucleotides have paired up with their specific bases on the DNA strand, they're joined together by RNA polymerase, forming an mRNA molecule.\n5) The RNA polymerase moves along the DNA, separating the strands and assembling the mRNA strand.\n6) The hydrogen bonds between the uncoiled strands of DNA reform once the RNA polymerase has passed by and the strands coil back into a double helix.\nDirection RNA polymerase is moving CGAAUCAAGGAG mRNA strand leaves nucleus and enters the cytoplasm\n7) In eukaryotes, it's actually a complex of proteins including a DNA helicase that separates the strands. RNA polymerase just assembles the mRNA strand.\n8) When RNA polymerase reaches a particular sequence of DNA called a stop signal, it stops making mRNA and detaches from the DNA.\n9) In eukaryotes, mRNA moves out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore and attaches to a ribosome in the cytoplasm, where the next stage of protein synthesis takes place (see next page).\n\n@@@SECTION OVERVIEW\nTopic 4A \u2014 DNA, RNA and Protein Synthesis","124":"@@@Reasons for Business Growth\nThe owners of many businesses do not want the firm to remain small \u2013 although some do, for reasons of remaining in control, avoiding taking too many risks and preventing workloads from becoming too heavy. Why do other business owners and directors of companies seek growth for their business? There are a number of possible reasons:\n- Increased profits \u2013 expanding the business and achieving higher sales is one way of becoming more profitable.\n- Increased market share \u2013 this will give a business a higher market profile and greater bargaining power with both suppliers (e.g., lower prices) and retailers (e.g., best positions in the shop).\n- Increased economies of scale \u2013 these are fully covered in Chapter 23.\n\n@@@Strengths and Weaknesses of Family Businesses\nFamily-owned businesses are those that are actively owned and managed by at least two members of the same family. In many cases, the family that founded the business retains complete ownership of it. Family-owned businesses are very important in nearly all economies, especially newly industrializing ones. It is estimated that 80% of all businesses in South Africa are family-owned and operated. Many family businesses are small \u2013 65% of all small businesses in Malaysia are family-owned and managed. However, not all family businesses are small. In Asia, family businesses make up 50% of all public limited companies (67% in India) and the founding families still retain a controlling interest (over 50% of shares). Family businesses have several significant strengths and weaknesses \u2013 see Table 3.5.\n\n@@@Disadvantages of Small and Large Businesses\nDisadvantages of small businesses:\n- May have limited access to sources of finance.\n- The owner\/s has\/have to carry a large burden of responsibility if unable to afford to employ specialist managers.\n- May not be diversified, so there are greater risks of negative impact of external change.\n- Few opportunities for economies of scale.\n\nDisadvantages of large businesses:\n- May be difficult to manage, especially if geographically spread.\n- May have potential cost increases associated with large-scale production.\n- May suffer from slow decision-making and poor communication due to the structure of the large organization.\n- May often suffer from a divorce between ownership and control that can lead to conflicting objectives.\n\n(Table 3.4 Potential disadvantages of small and large businesses is cited here but not reproduced in text.)\n\n@@@Detailed Analysis of Family Business Dynamics\nStrengths:\n- Commitment: The family owners often show dedication in seeing the business grow, prosper and get passed on to future generations. As a result, many family members identify with the company and have the incentive to work harder and reinvest part of their profits into the business to allow it to grow in the long term.\n- Reliability and pride: Because family businesses have their name and reputation associated with their products, they strive to increase the quality of their output and to maintain a good relationship with their stakeholders.\n- Knowledge continuity: Families in business make it a priority to pass their accumulated knowledge, experience, and skills to the next generation. Many family members become involved in the family business from a very young age. This increases their level of commitment and could provide them with the necessary tools to run their family business.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Succession\/continuity problem: Many family businesses fail to be sustainable in the long term. On average only around 15% continue into the third generation of the descendants of the founder(s). This high rate of failure among family businesses can often be explained by the lack of skills and ability of later generations or the splitting of management responsibilities between several family members to give them all a role in it.\n- Informality: Because most families run their businesses themselves, there is usually little interest in setting clear and formal business practices and procedures. As the family and its business grow larger, this situation can lead to inefficiencies and internal conflicts.\n- Traditional: There is quite often a reluctance to change systems and procedures, preferring to continue to operate as it was historically run. Lack of innovation could be a consequence.\n- Conflict: Problems within the family may reflect on the management of the business and make effective decisions less likely.\n\n(Table 3.5 Strengths and weaknesses of family businesses is cited here but not reproduced in text.)","125":"@@@Understanding Exchange Rates in Business\nExchange rates are a very important Business topic. You should be able to analyse, with appropriate calculations if necessary, how rises or falls in an exchange rate might impact on importers and exporters (see Figure 9.4). \n\n@@@The Role of Non-Price Factors in International Competitiveness\nIt must not be thought that low prices alone will guarantee success of a business product if they are only slightly less than those of competitors. Consumers consider many non-price factors in making purchasing decisions too. German and Japanese businesses became worldwide successes in the 1970s and 1980s, even though their exchange rates were often said to be high during this period, making their goods relatively expensive abroad. How did they compete so successfully even though other countries may have had a price advantage over them? The following are the factors, other than product prices, that can determine the international success \u2013 or competitiveness \u2013 of a business:\n\u25a0 Product design and innovation: An innovative product, such as the latest Apple iPad, will attract custom, even though it may be sold at premium prices.\n\u25a0 Quality of construction and reliability: For several years, Japanese cars have been declared the most reliable on the US market and, even though they are not the cheapest models around, this encourages consumer interest.\n\u25a0 Effective promotion and extensive distribution: These two factors go some way to explain the universal success of McDonald\u2019s restaurants.\n\u25a0 After-sales service: This includes extended guarantee periods.\n\u25a0 Investment in trained staff and modern technology: This should allow flexibility of production to meet frequent changes in consumer tastes. Higher labour productivity can overcome drawbacks caused by higher costs of other resources.\n\n@@@Macro-economic Policies and Fiscal Policy\nThese are policies that are designed to impact on the whole economy \u2013 or the \u2018macro-economy\u2019. They mainly operate by influencing the level of total or aggregate demand in the economy. This level of demand then works through to determine the value of output of goods and services (GDP) and, as a consequence, the level of employment. \nIn many countries, the government is responsible for spending (and raising in taxes) up to 40% of the GDP. The major expenditure programmes include social security, health service, education, defence and other areas of government spending. Fiscal policy: concerned with decisions about government expenditure, tax rates and government borrowing \u2013 these operate largely through the government\u2019s annual budget decisions. \nFigure 9.4 illustrates the US dollar to euro exchange rate over a period of time, showcasing the fluctuations that can impact economic decisions.","126":"@@@Additional Measures for Comparing Business Size Specific to Different Industries\nOther measures that can be used will depend very much on the industry. The number of guest beds or guest rooms could be used to compare hotel businesses. The number of shops could be used for retailers. Total floor sales space could also be used to compare retail businesses. Profit is not a good measure of business size \u2013 but it can be used to assess business performance.\n\n@@@The Relative Nature of Business Size Measurement\nWhich form of measurement is best? There is no \u2018best\u2019 measure. The one used depends on what needs to be established about the firms being compared. This could depend on whether we are interested in absolute size or comparative size within one industry. If an absolute measure of size is required, then it is almost certainly advisable to test a firm on at least two of the above criteria and to make comparisons on the basis of these. If asked to comment on data showing the sizes of different businesses, do remember that if another measure were used, the conclusions about relative size might be very different.\n\n@@@The Role and Importance of Small and Micro-Businesses in the Economy\nThe significance of small and micro-businesses can be seen even though we have not established a universally agreed definition of small firms; it will be easy to identify them within your own economy. They will employ few people and will have a low turnover compared to other firms. The official definition within your own country could be discovered from the trade and industry department. It is now common to make a further distinction for very small businesses known as \u2018micro-enterprises\u2019. The European Union definitions are shown in Table 3.1. \n\nSmall firms (including micro-enterprises) are very important to all economies and to the industry in which they operate. Encouraging the development of small business units can have the following benefits:\n\n- Many jobs are created by small firms and, even though each one may not employ many staff, collectively the small-business sector employs a very significant proportion of the working population in most countries.\n- Small businesses are often run by dynamic entrepreneurs, with new ideas for consumer goods and services. This helps to create variety in the market and consumers will benefit from greater choice.\n- Small firms can create competition for larger businesses. Without this competition, larger firms could exploit consumers with high prices and poor service. The cost of air travel has been reduced in recent years due to the establishment of many small airlines competing with the large, established companies.\n- Small firms often supply specialist goods and services to important industries in a country. For example, the global car industry is dominated by major manufacturers such as Toyota, BMW and Ford. All of these large businesses depend on small specialist suppliers of on-board computers, high-quality audio equipment, and headlights. Very often, by being able to adapt quickly to the changing needs of large firms, small businesses actually increase the competitiveness of the larger organizations.\n- All great businesses were small at one time. The Body Shop began in one small rented store in 1976. Hewlett-Packard started assembling electrical equipment in Packard\u2019s garage! The large firms of the future are the small firms of today \u2013 and the more small firms are encouraged to become established and expand, the greater the chances that an economy will benefit from large-scale organizations in the future.\n- Small firms may enjoy lower average costs than larger ones and this benefit could be passed on to the consumer too. Costs could be lower because wage rates paid to staff may be less than the salaries paid in large organizations, or the sheer cost of the administration and management structure of bigger enterprises may increase their costs dramatically.\n\nBusiness category \/ Employees \/ Revenue \/ Capital employed\nMedium: 51\u2013250 \/ over \u20ac10m to \u20ac50m \/ over \u20ac10m to \u20ac34m\nSmall: 11\u201350 \/ over \u20ac2m to \u20ac10m \/ over \u20ac2m to \u20ac10m\nMicro: 10 or fewer \/ up to \u20ac2m \/ up to \u20ac2m\nTable 3.1 EU classifications of business size.","127":"@@@Significance of Accurate Record Keeping in Business\nThe lack of accurate records is a big reason for business failure. Many entrepreneurs fail to pay sufficient attention to record keeping, either underestimating its importance compared to meeting customers' needs or believing they can remember all details. However, memory is unreliable over time. For example, a new busy florist shop owner needs to remember when the next delivery of fresh flowers is due, whether the big wedding from last week has been paid for, if the cheque from the government department for the display of flowers has been banked, and how many hours the shop assistant worked the previous week. Such details highlight the importance of maintaining accurate and up-to-date records of business transactions and other issues. With the decreasing cost of computing, most businesses use computers for record-keeping, but it is advisable to maintain paper records as well. These can serve as a backup in case of computer failure and as evidence during tax disputes.\n\n@@@The Challenge of Cash and Working Capital for New Businesses\nRunning short of capital to run day-to-day business affairs is the most common reason for new businesses not surviving the first year. Capital is essential for everyday cash, holding inventories, and providing trade credit to customers, who become trade receivables. Without ample working capital, a business may not be able to procure supplies, pay suppliers, or offer credit to key customers, potentially leading to shutdown. Serious deficits in working capital can usually be prevented by constructing a cash flow forecast to assess liquidity and needs, injecting sufficient startup capital to last the initial months when cash flow may be slow, establishing good bank relations for potential short-term solutions like overdraft extensions, and practicing effective credit control over customer accounts to ensure timely payments.\n\n@@@Poor Management Skills as a Barrier to Business Success\nMost entrepreneurs have work experience but not necessarily at a management level, which means they may lack essential skills like leadership, cash handling and management, planning and coordination, decision-making, communication, and marketing. A passionate, dedicated entrepreneur might excel in their field, such as cooking for a chef opening a restaurant, but may struggle with the management side. Learning these skills quickly once the business is operating is risky, although training and advice are available through certain organizations, and some choose to hire staff with management experience. However, this option might not be financially feasible for new businesses. It is a misconception that enthusiasm, a strong personality, and hard work alone can guarantee success. Therefore, potential entrepreneurs are often encouraged to attend training courses to acquire essential skills before risking their capital or gaining management experience through employment. This section underscores the importance of management functions and the requisite skills for being a good manager.\n\n@@@The Dynamic Nature of the Business Environment\nSetting up a new business is fraught with risk due to the ever-changing business environment. Beyond the issues discussed previously, the risk of change itself can undermine an originally successful business idea. Change is a key aspect of Business syllabuses and is thoroughly examined in this book, specifically in Unit 6, Chapter 40. At this stage, it is noted that new businesses may fail due to various changes, which highlights the dynamic nature of business operations and underscores the need for entrepreneurs to be adaptable and well-informed of industry trends and shifts.","128":"@@@Exchange Across Cell Membranes \u2014 Osmosis\nThese two pages are entirely about the movement of water molecules. If you've mastered diffusion (see pages 38-39), you'll nail this lot in no time. Osmosis is Diffusion of Water Molecules. Osmosis is the diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane, from an area of higher water potential (i.e., higher concentration of water molecules) to an area of lower water potential (i.e., lower concentration of water molecules). Water potential is the potential (likelihood) of water molecules to diffuse out of or into a solution. Pure water has the highest water potential. All solutions have a lower water potential than pure water. If two solutions have the same water potential, they're said to be isotonic.\n\n@@@The Rate of Osmosis Depends on Several Factors\nThe factors affecting the rate of osmosis are similar to those affecting the rate of diffusion (see previous page). 1) The water potential gradient \u2014 the higher the water potential gradient, the faster the rate of osmosis. As osmosis takes place, the difference in water potential on either side of the membrane decreases, so the rate of osmosis levels off over time. 2) The thickness of the exchange surface \u2014 the thinner the exchange surface, the faster the rate of osmosis. 3) The surface area of the exchange surface \u2014 the larger the surface area, the faster the rate of osmosis.\n\n@@@Experiments to Investigate Water Potential using Serial Dilutions\nYou can do a simple experiment, using potato cylinders, to find out the water potential of plant tissue (see next page). First though, you need to make up several solutions of different, known concentrations to test the cylinders in. You can do this using a serial dilution technique: This is how you'd make five serial dilutions of a sucrose solution, starting with an initial sucrose concentration of 2 M and diluting each solution by a factor of 2...\n\n@@@Serial Dilution Technique\nLine up five test tubes in a rack. You don't have to dilute solutions by a factor of 2. For example, to dilute by a factor of 10, take 1 cm3 from your original sample and add it to 9 cm3 of water. Transfer 5 cm3 of the initial 2 M sucrose solution to the first test tube and 5 cm3 of distilled water to the other four test tubes. Then, using a pipette, draw 5 cm3 of the solution from the first test tube, add it to the distilled water in the second test tube and mix the solution thoroughly. You now have 10 cm3 of solution that's half as concentrated as the solution in the first test tube (it's 1 M). Repeat this process three more times to create solutions of 0.5 M, 0.25 M, and 0.125 M.\n\n@@@Topic 2B \u2014 Cell Membranes\n10 cm3 of 2 M sucrose solution. 5 cm3 of distilled water.","129":"@@@Exchange Across Cell Membranes \u2014 Introduction to Active Transport\n\nDiffusion and osmosis are passive processes \u2014 they don't require energy. So, for those of you feeling a bit more active, here's a page all about... you guessed it... active transport.\n\n@@@The Basics of Active Transport and Energy Requirements\n\nActive transport uses energy to move molecules and ions across membranes, usually against a concentration gradient. Carrier proteins are involved in active transport. The process is pretty similar to facilitated diffusion (see p. 38) \u2014 a molecule attaches to the carrier protein, the protein changes shape and this moves the molecule across the membrane, releasing it on the other side. There are two main differences between active transport and facilitated diffusion though: 1) Active transport usually moves solutes from a low to a high concentration\u2014 in facilitated diffusion, they always move from a high to a low concentration. 2) Active transport requires energy \u2014 facilitated diffusion does not. ATP is a common source of energy in the cell. It's produced by respiration. ATP undergoes a hydrolysis reaction, splitting into ADP and Pi (inorganic phosphate). This releases energy so that the solutes can be transported. The diagram shows the active transport of calcium. Unlike facilitated diffusion, active transport doesn't use channel proteins.\n\n@@@Co-Transporters in Active Transport\n\nCo-transporters are a type of carrier protein. 1) They bind two molecules at a time. 2) The concentration gradient of one of the molecules is used to move the other molecule against its own concentration gradient. The diagram shows the co-transport of sodium ions and glucose. Sodium ions move into the cell down their concentration gradient. This moves glucose into the cell too, against its concentration gradient.\n\n@@@Factors Affecting the Rate of Active Transport\n\nLearn these factors affecting the rate of active transport. When active transport moves molecules and ions against their concentration gradient, a decreasing concentration gradient doesn't affect the rate of active transport. The rate of active transport is affected by: 1) The speed of individual carrier proteins \u2014 the faster they work, the faster the rate of active transport. 2) The number of carrier proteins present \u2014 the more proteins there are, the faster the rate of active transport. 3) The rate of respiration in the cell and the availability of ATP. If respiration is inhibited, active transport can't take place.\n\n@@@Topic Overview\n\nTopic 2B \u2014 Cell Membranes","130":"@@@Aerobic Respiration and Krebs Cycle Products\n776Aerobic Respiration involves several biochemical processes that result in the production of energy from glucose. One of these processes is the Krebs Cycle, which generates various products. Some of these products of the Krebs Cycle are used for subsequent stages of respiration, while others have different fates:\n- From one turn of the Krebs Cycle, one molecule of coenzyme A is reused in the next link reaction.\n- Oxaloacetate is regenerated for use in the next Krebs cycle.\n- Two molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) are released as a waste product.\n- One molecule of ATP is produced and used for energy.\n- Three molecules of reduced NAD (NADH) are sent to oxidative phosphorylation.\n- One molecule of reduced FAD (FADH2) is also directed to oxidative phosphorylation.\n\n@@@Oxidative Phosphorylation and ATP Production\nOxidative Phosphorylation is crucial for producing a large amount of ATP:\n1) This process harnesses the energy carried by electrons from reduced coenzymes\u2014specifically reduced NAD (NADH) and reduced FAD (FADH2)\u2014to synthesize ATP. The generation of these reduced coenzymes during previous stages of respiration is essential for the final ATP-producing step.\n2) Oxidative phosphorylation includes the electron transport chain and chemiosmosis. These mechanisms are foundational to aerobic respiration, serving as a link between the initial stages and the production of ATP.\n\n@@@Electron Transport Chain and Chemiosmosis\nAerobic Respiration requires a complex sequence of processes where electrons are transported through carriers, and chemiosmosis facilitates ATP synthesis:\n1) As reduced NAD (NADH) and reduced FAD (FADH2) are oxidized, they release hydrogen atoms. These hydrogen atoms split into protons (H+) and electrons (e-).\n2) The electrons then travel through the electron transport chain, which consists of a series of electron carriers. As electrons move from one carrier to another, they lose energy.\n3) This energy is utilized by the carriers to pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, creating a high concentration of protons in this space.\n4) A gradient is formed due to the higher proton concentration in the intermembrane space compared to the mitochondrial matrix. This gradient is an electrochemical force that drives protons back across the inner mitochondrial membrane via ATP synthase, a protein in the membrane.\n5) As protons flow through ATP synthase, the enzyme catalyzes the conversion of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) into ATP.\n6) Chemiosmosis, driven by proton movement across a membrane resulting from electron transport, is central to ATP production and is explained by the chemiosmotic theory.\n7) At the end of the electron transport chain, within the mitochondrial matrix, protons, electrons, and molecular oxygen (O2) from the blood combine to form water. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor in the chain, and its role is critical to the formation of water and the overall process of aerobic respiration.\n\n@@@Overview of Aerobic Respiration and Its Connection to Photosynthesis\nOverall, the aerobic respiration process can be summarized in a map that highlights the main stages: Glycolysis, the Link Reaction, the Krebs Cycle, and finally, Oxidative Phosphorylation. Each stage is interconnected and contributes to the energy production pathway. Aerobic Respiration is deeply connected to Photosynthesis, which is covered in Topic 5 A. Both processes are essential for the energy flow within biological systems, with respiration releasing the energy stored in organic molecules and photosynthesis capturing light energy to produce those organic molecules.","131":"@@@Introduction to the Chi-Squared Test\nJust when you thought it was safe to turn the page... I stick in some maths. Surprise! The Chi-Squared Test can be used to check the results of genetic crosses.\n\n@@@Understanding the Chi-Squared Test\n1) The chi-squared (x^2) test is a statistical test that's used to see if the results of an experiment support a theory. 2) First, the theory is used to predict a result \u2014 this is called the expected result. Then, the experiment is carried out and the actual result is recorded \u2014 this is called the observed result. 3) To see if the results support the theory you have to make a hypothesis called the null hypothesis. 4) The null hypothesis is always that there's no significant difference between the observed and expected results (your experimental result will usually be a bit different from what you expect, but you need to know if the difference is just due to chance, or because your theory is wrong). 5) The x^2 test is then carried out to compare the 'goodness of fit' of the observed and expected results (i.e., to compare how well the observed results match the expected results). The outcome either supports or rejects the null hypothesis.\n\n@@@The Chi-Squared Test in Genetics\n6) You can use the x^2 test in genetics to test theories about the inheritance of characteristics. For example:\nTheory: Wing length in fruit flies is controlled by a single gene with two alleles (monohybrid inheritance). The dominant allele (N) gives normal wings, and the recessive allele (n) gives vestigial wings. Expected results: With monohybrid inheritance, if you cross a homozygous dominant parent with a homozygous recessive parent, you'd expect a 3:1 phenotypic ratio of normal:vestigial wings in the F1 generation (see p. 156). Observed results: The experiment (of crossing a homozygous dominant parent with a homozygous recessive parent) is carried out on fruit flies and the number of F2 offspring with normal and vestigial wings is counted. Null hypothesis: There's no significant difference between the observed and expected results. (If the x^2 test shows the observed and expected results are not significantly different, then we are unable to reject the null hypothesis which supports the theory that wing length is controlled by monohybrid inheritance.)\n\n@@@Calculating the Chi-Squared Value\nFirst, you need a Chi-Squared value. In this kind of statistical test, 'the data = hypothesis is true \u2014 you can only 'fail to reject it'. This just means that the evidence doesn't give you a reason to think the null hypothesis is wrong. Chi-squared x^2 is calculated using this formula: x^2 = \u03a3[(O - E)^2 \/ E], where O = observed result and E = expected result. \u03a3 just means 'the sum of...'. Although you won't be expected to calculate a chi-squared value in the written exams, you do need to understand how the test works, so that you can interpret the results. Here's an example for testing the wing length of fruit flies as explained above: Homozygous dominant (NN) flies are crossed with homozygous recessive (nn) flies. 160 offspring are produced in the F2 generation. (J) First, the number of offspring (out of a total of 160) expected for each phenotype is worked out E for normal wings: 160 (total) \/ 4 (ratio total) x 3 (predicted ratio for normal wings) = 120. E for vestigial wings: 160 \/ 4 x 1 = 40. (T) Then the actual number of offspring observed with each phenotype (out of the 160 offspring) is recorded, e.g. 111 with normal wings. Phenotype: Normal wings 3:1 120 E Vs 111 O. Vestigial wings 1:4 40 E Vs 49 O. The results are used to work out x^2. Phenotype Ratio Expected Result (E) Observed Result (O) (O-E)^2 \/ E, Normal wings 3:1 120 111 0.675, Vestigial wings 1:4 40 49 12.025, The total for this column (2.7) = x^2.\n\n@@@Summary of Genetic Probabilities Testing\nThe Chi-squared test, with its ability to compare observed versus expected outcomes, plays a crucial role in validating genetic theories, such as monohybrid inheritance in fruit flies. A deeper understanding of the null hypothesis, calculating the Chi-squared value, and the implications of the results help demonstrate whether observed genetic patterns align with predicted models, ultimately supporting or rejecting the initial theory. This statistical analysis is an essential part of Topic 7A \u2014 Genetics.","132":"@@@Overview of Photosynthesis Experiments and Importance of Pigments\nEveryone loves a good experiment \u2014 especially when they involve bright colours. Here are two really colourful photosynthesis experiments for you to enjoy. Let's chop up some plants and marvel at the beauty of Biology. All plants contain several different photosynthetic pigments in their leaves. Each pigment absorbs a different wavelength of light, so having more than one type of pigment increases the range of wavelengths of light that a plant can absorb. In addition to photosynthetic pigments, some plants also have other pigments in their leaves, which play other essential roles, e.g. protecting the leaves from excessive UV radiation. Different species of plants contain different proportions and mixtures of pigments. Ore way that shade-tolerant plants can adapt to the light conditions in their environment is by possessing a different proportion of photosynthetic pigments, which allows the plant to make the best use of the light available to it. The mixture of non-photosynthetic pigments is also likely to be different. For example, the chloroplasts of shade-tolerant plants are adapted for photosynthesis in low light conditions, but really sensitive to higher levels of light. These plants sometimes produce dark red and purple pigments called anthocyanins, which are thought to protect their chloroplasts from brief exposure to higher light levels.\n\n@@@Chromatography: A Method to Investigate Plant Pigments\nYou can investigate the pigments in leaves using chromatography. You can use thin layer chromatography (TLC) to determine what pigments are present in the leaves of a plant. Like all chromatography, TLC involves a mobile phase \u2014 where molecules can move. In TLC, this is a liquid solvent. A stationary phase \u2014 where molecules can't move. In TLC, this consists of a solid (e.g. glass) plate with a thin layer of gel (e.g. silica gel) on top. A sample of pigments can be extracted from the plant and put on the TLC plate. When the plate is placed vertically in the solvent, the solvent moves upwards through the gel, carrying the dissolved pigments with it. Some pigments will travel faster or further through the gel than others, which separates them out. It's possible to identify a certain pigment by calculating its Rf value and looking it up in a database. The Rf value is the distance a substance has moved through the gel in relation to the solvent. Each pigment has a specific Rf value.\n\n@@@Comparing Pigments in Different Plant Species Using TLC\nTLC can be used to compare the pigments present in shade-tolerant plants and shade-intolerant plants. This example shows you how to use TLC to compare the pigments present in shade-tolerant plants and shade-intolerant plants. Make sure you're wearing a lab coat, eye protection and gloves before you start. Many of the chemicals involved are toxic and highly flammable. It's best to do steps two and five in a fume cupboard as the chemicals used are volatile (evaporate easily) and the vapours are hazardous. 1) Grind up several leaves from the shade-tolerant plant you're investigating with some anhydrous sodium sulfate, then add a few drops of propanone. 2) Transfer the liquid to a test tube, add some petroleum ether and gently shake the tube. Two distinct layers will form in the liquid \u2014 the top layer is the pigments mixed in with the petroleum ether. 3) Transfer some of the liquid from the top layer into a second test tube with some anhydrous sodium sulfate. 4) Draw a horizontal pencil line near the bottom of a TLC plate. Build up a single concentrated spot of the liquid from step three on the line by applying several drops and ensuring each one is dry before the next is added. This is the point of origin. 5) Once the point of origin is completely dry, put the plate into a small glass container with some prepared solvent (e.g. a mixture of propanone, cyclohexane, and petroleum ether) \u2014 just enough so that the point of origin is a little bit above the solvent. Put a lid on the container and leave the plate to develop. As the solvent spreads up the plate, the different pigments move with it, but at different rates \u2014 so they separate. 6) When the solvent has nearly reached the top, take the plate out and mark the solvent front (the furthest point the solvent has reached) with a pencil and leave the plate to dry in a well-ventilated place. 7) There should be several new coloured spots on the chromatography plate between the point of origin and the solvent front. These are the separated pigments. You can calculate their Rf values and look them up in a database to identify what the pigments are. 8) Repeat the process for the shade-intolerant plant you're investigating and compare the pigments present in their leaves. You may find that the mixture of pigments in the leaves of the shade-tolerant plant is quite different compared to the shade-intolerant plant.\n\n@@@Concluding Remarks on Photosynthesis\nTopic 5A \u2014 Photosynthesis and Respiration.","133":"@@@ CARBOHYDRATES IN BIOLOGY\n\nChemistry for biologists plays a crucial role in understanding the various carbohydrates essential to life science. Pentose sugars, characterized by their five carbon atoms and general formula C5H10O5, are significant as they constitute the backbone of vital nucleic acids such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), which make up the genetic material. This is further discussed in Section 2B.3. Another key group, hexose sugars, possess six carbon atoms and adhere to the formula C6H12O6. These are well-known monosaccharides, often sweet, and include glucose, galactose, and fructose.\n\nWhile general formulae indicate the molecular composition, they don't reveal the structure or behavior of molecules. Displayed formulae, although not showing the carbon chain's detailed shape, can provide insight into molecular arrangement in three dimensions, helping to explain biological system behaviors. Pentose sugars like ribose, with their five carbon atoms, are visually demonstrated in figure C.\n\nFor hexose sugars, the ring structure is highlighted in figure D, emphasizing the importance of the atom arrangement on side chains which significantly influences the molecule's utilization by the body. The numbering of carbon atoms helps identify differing arrangements. Glucose, specifically, exhibits two isomers: \u03b1-glucose and \u03b2-glucose. Each has a distinctive atom arrangement on their side chains, which influences the formation of bonds with neighboring glucose molecules, consequently affecting the resulting polymers. Further details can be found in Section 4A.5.\n\n@@@ THE IMPACT OF CHEMICAL CHANGES ON SUGARS\n\nModifying sugars through hydrogenation can reduce the energy they provide. When glucose undergoes this process, it is converted into sorbitol (C6H14O6), a compound up to 60% sweeter than glucose yet offering lesser energy, which is detailed through energy counts favoring weight loss. Such chemical structure alterations can have profound implications on function.\n\n@@@ DISACCHARIDES: COMPLEX SUGAR STRUCTURES\n\nDisaccharides are complex sugars formed by the joining of two monosaccharides, as seen in sucrose, where a molecule of \u03b1-glucose combines with one of fructose. This fusion occurs through a condensation reaction that also releases a water molecule. The resulting glycosidic bond\u2014a covalent link between monosaccharides\u2014is described by the carbons involved, with 1,4-glycosidic and 1,6-glycosidic bonds being two examples. The process and resulting molecule of water are illustrated in figure E.\n\nThe diversity in monosaccharide pairings results in different disaccharides with varying properties and tastes. Table A enumerates some common disaccharides, their sources, and constituent monosaccharides, providing an at-a-glance understanding of these double sugars.","134":"@@@Immunity and the Role of Vaccines\nThe primary response gives us immunity against a disease, but only after you've become infected. If only there was a way to stimulate memory cell production without getting the disease... well, there is \u2014 vaccination. Vaccines can Protect Individuals and Populations Against Disease. \n\n1) While your B-cells are busy dividing to build up their numbers to deal with a pathogen (i.e. the primary response \u2014 see previous page), you suffer from the disease. Vaccination can help avoid this. \n\n2) Vaccines contain antigens that cause your body to produce memory cells against a particular pathogen, without the pathogen causing disease. This means you become immune without getting any symptoms. \n\n3) Vaccines protect individuals that have them and, because they reduce the occurrence of the disease, those not vaccinated are also less likely to catch the disease (because there are fewer people to catch it from). This is called herd immunity. \n\n4) Vaccines always contain antigens \u2014 these may be free or attached to a dead or attenuated (weakened) pathogen. \n\n5) Vaccines may be injected or taken orally. The disadvantages of taking a vaccine orally are that it could be broken down by enzymes in the gut or the molecules of the vaccine may be too large to be absorbed into the blood. \n\n6) Sometimes booster vaccines are given later on (e.g. after several years) to make sure that memory cells are produced.\n\n@@@Antigenic Variation and its Impact on Immunity\nAntigenic Variation Helps Some Pathogens Evade the Immune System. \n\n1) Antigens on the surface of pathogens activate the primary response. \n\n2) When you're infected a second time with the same pathogen (which has the same antigens on its surface) they activate the secondary response and you don't get ill. \n\n3) However, some sneaky pathogens can change their surface antigens. This antigen variability is called antigenic variation. (Different antigens are formed due to changes in the genes of a pathogen.) \n\n4) This means that when you're infected for a second time, the memory cells produced from the first infection will not recognise the different antigens. So the immune system has to start from scratch and carry out a primary response against these new antigens. \n\n5) This primary response takes time to get rid of the infection, which is why you get ill again. \n\n6) Antigenic variation also makes it difficult to develop vaccines against some pathogens for the same reason. Examples of pathogens that show antigenic variation include HIV and the influenza virus.\n\n7) Here's how antigenic variation affects the production of vaccines to help prevent people catching influenza: \n\n1) The influenza (flu) vaccine changes every year. That's because the antigens on the surface of the influenza virus change regularly, forming new strains of the virus. \n\n2) Memory cells produced from vaccination with one strain of the flu will not recognise other strains with different antigens. The strains are immunologically distinct. \n\n3) Every year there are different strains of the influenza virus circulating in the population, so a different vaccine has to be made. \n\n4) New vaccines are developed and one is chosen every year that is the most effective against the recently circulating influenza viruses. \n\n5) Governments and health authorities then implement a programme of vaccination using the most suitable vaccine.\n\n1st infection\n2nd infection\ndifferent antigens\n\nThe oral vaccine was proving hard to swallow.\nTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System","135":"@@@Exchange Across Cell Membranes \u2014 Diffusion\nOoooh it's starting to get a bit more exciting... here's how some substances can get across cell membranes without using energy, just what you've always wanted to know, I bet.\n\n@@@Diffusion is the Passive Movement of Particles\n1) Diffusion is the net movement of particles (molecules or ions) from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.\n2) Molecules will diffuse both ways, but the net movement will be to the area of lower concentration. This continues until particles are evenly distributed throughout the liquid or gas.\n3) The concentration gradient is the path from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Particles diffuse down a concentration gradient\n4) Diffusion is a passive process \u2014 no energy is needed for it to happen.\n5) Particles can diffuse across cell membranes, as long as they can move freely through the membrane.\nPolar molecules have partial positive and negative charges (see p. 20). Non-polar molecules don't. E.g. oxygen and carbon dioxide can diffuse easily through cell membranes because they're small, so they can pass through spaces between the phospholipids. They're also non-polar, which makes them soluble in lipids, so they can dissolve in the hydrophobic bilayer.\n6) When molecules diffuse directly through a cell membrane, it's also known as simple diffusion.\n\n@@@Facilitated Diffusion uses Carrier Proteins and Protein Channels\n1) Some larger molecules (e.g. amino acids, glucose) would diffuse extremely slowly through the phospholipid bilayer because they're so big.\n2) Charged particles, e.g. ions and polar molecules, would also diffuse slowly \u2014 that's because they're water soluble, and the centre of the bilayer is hydrophobic (see page 36).\n3) So to speed things up, large or charged particles diffuse through carrier proteins or channel proteins in the membrane instead \u2014 this is called facilitated diffusion.\n4) Like diffusion, facilitated diffusion moves particles down a concentration gradient, from a higher to a lower concentration.\n5) It's also a passive process \u2014 it doesn't use energy.\nAndy needed all his concentration for this particular gradient...\nCarrier proteins move large molecules across membranes, down their concentration gradient. Different carrier proteins facilitate the diffusion of different molecules.\n1) First, a large molecule attaches to a carrier protein in the membrane.\n2) Then, the protein changes shape.\n3) This releases the molecule on the opposite side of the membrane.\nChannel proteins form pores in the membrane for charged particles to diffuse through (down their concentration gradient).

They're not even living things \u2014 they can only reproduce inside the cells of another organism (called the host). All viruses cause disease, and you need to know all about one particularly nasty blighter...HIV is the Virus That Causes AIDS\n1) HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that affects the immune system. It eventually leads to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n2) AIDS is a condition where the immune system deteriorates and eventually fails. This makes someone with AIDS more vulnerable to other infections, like pneumonia (see next page).\n3) HIV infects (and eventually kills) helper T-cells, which act as the host cells (see p. 28) for the virus. Remember, helper T-cells send chemical signals that activate phagocytes, cytotoxic T-cells and B-cells (see p. 44) so they're hugely important cells in the immune response. Without enough helper T-cells, the immune system is unable to mount an effective response to infections because other immune system cells don't behave how they should.\n4) People infected with HIV develop AIDS when the helper T-cell numbers in their body reach a critically low level.\n\n@@@The Structure of HIV\nHIV has a Spherical Structure\nYou might get asked about the structure of HIV in your exam\n1) A core that contains the genetic material (RNA) and some proteins (including the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is needed for virus replication).\n2) An outer coating of protein called a capsid.\n3) An extra outer layer called an envelope. This is made of membrane stolen from the cell membrane of a previous host cell.\n4) Sticking out from the envelope are loads of copies of an attachment protein that help HIV attach to the host helper T-cell.\n\n@@@How HIV Replicates Inside Host Cells\nHIV Replicates Inside its Host\u2019s Helper T-Cells\nHIV (and all other viruses) can only reproduce inside the cells of the organism it has infected. HIV replicates inside the helper T-cells of the host. It doesn't have the equipment (such as enzymes and ribosomes) to replicate on its own, so it uses those of the host cell.\nHere's how HIV replicates:\n1) The attachment protein attaches to a receptor molecule on the cell membrane of the host helper T-cell.\n2) The capsid is released into the cell, where it uncoats and releases the genetic material (RNA) into the cell's cytoplasm.\n3) Inside the cell, reverse transcriptase is used to make a complementary strand of DNA from the viral RNA template (see p. 16-17 for more on DNA and RNA).\n4) From this, double-stranded DNA is made and inserted into the human DNA.\n5) Host cell enzymes are used to make viral proteins from the viral DNA found within the human DNA.\n6) The viral proteins are assembled into new viruses, which bud from the cell and go on to infect other cells.\nDuring the initial infection period, HIV replicates rapidly and the infected person may experience severe flu-like symptoms. After this period, HIV replication drops to a lower level. This is the latency period. During the latency period (which can last for years), the infected person won't experience any symptoms. \n\n@@@Illustration Key\nTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n\u00a9HIV\nhelper T cell\nDNA\n\u00a9\u00aev \u201c \u201c  D\nAttachment protein Capsid\nS1 , \" \"........................u-n,,,,,._ ttachnient proteins can also -Envelope\nGenetic material\nReverse transcriptase","137":"@@@Introduction to Energy, Photosynthesis, and Respiration\nAll organisms need energy for life processes, which is essential for actions such as revision. Energy is intricately linked to complex biological phenomena, but it's broken down into comprehensible parts. Both plant and animal cells require energy for a myriad of biological processes to occur. For instance, plants harness energy for vital functions including photosynthesis, active transport like absorbing minerals through their roots, DNA replication, cell division, and protein synthesis. Similarly, animals depend on energy for necessary activities such as muscle contraction, maintaining body temperature, active transport, DNA replication, cell division, and protein synthesis. \n\n@@@Photosynthesis: The Energy Storage Process\nPhotosynthesis plays a critical role in the energy cycle by transforming light energy into chemical energy, which is stored in glucose. This process happens through a series of reactions, summarized by the equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + Energy => C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2. Essentially, plants store energy within glucose until it's needed for respiration. Animals enter this cycle by consuming plants (or other animals), thereby ingesting glucose and subsequently releasing its energy through respiration.\n\n@@@Cellular Energy Release via Respiration\nPlants and animal cells release the energy stored in glucose through respiration. This released energy is what powers every biological process within a cell. There are two forms of respiration: aerobic, which utilizes oxygen, and anaerobic, which does not. Aerobic respiration is characterized by the production of carbon dioxide and water along with energy release, as encapsulated by the equation: C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2 => 6CO2 + 6H2O + Energy. In contrast, anaerobic respiration in plants and yeast results in ethanol and carbon dioxide, whereas in humans it produces lactate, both pathways releasing energy.\n\n@@@ATP: The Cell's Immediate Energy Currency\nATP, or adenosine triphosphate, is a familiar molecule from previous topics that acts as the immediate source of energy in a cell. Cells cannot directly utilize energy from glucose; thus, respiration converts this energy into ATP. Carrying energy where needed within the cell, ATP is produced by a condensation reaction between adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi), driven by energy from catabolic reactions like glucose breakdown. This reaction, catalyzed by ATP synthase, stores energy in a phosphate bond. ATP then diffuses to areas where energy is required, is hydrolyzed back into ADP and Pi, releasing chemical energy for cellular use by the action of ATP hydrolase. The cycle is completed when the ADP and Pi are recycled, preparing the cell to start the process anew.\n","138":"@@@Introduction to Photosynthesis\nRight, pen at the ready. Check. Brain switched on. Check. Cuppa piping hot. Check. Sweets on standby. Check. Okay, I think you're all sorted to start photosynthesis. Finally, take a deep breath and here we go...\n\n@@@The Structure of Chloroplasts for Photosynthesis\nPhotosynthesis takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells which are described as follows:\n1) Chloroplasts are flattened organelles surrounded by a double membrane and are found in plant cells.\n2) Thylakoids, fluid-filled sacs, are stacked up in the chloroplast into structures called grana (singular = granum), and the grana are linked together by bits of thylakoid membrane called lamellae (singular = lamella).\n4) Chloroplasts contain photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotene, which are coloured substances that absorb the light energy needed for photosynthesis. These pigments are located in the thylakoid membranes, attached to proteins, forming a unit known as a photosystem.\n5) There are two types of photosystems used by plants to capture light energy: Photosystem I (or PSI) absorbs light best at a wavelength of 700 nm, and photosystem II (PSII) best at 680 nm.\n6) Within the inner membrane of the chloroplast and surrounding the thylakoids is a gel-like substance called the stroma, which contains enzymes, sugars, and organic acids.\n7) Carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis that are not immediately used are stored as starch grains in the stroma. The chloroplast structure is integral to its function in photosynthesis as depicted in the diagram provided.\n\n@@@Photosynthesis: A Two-Stage Process\nPhotosynthesis can be split into two stages:\nThe first stage is light-dependent and involves several key steps:\n1) The process requires light energy to proceed.\n2) It occurs within the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts.\n3) Light energy here is absorbed by chlorophyll and other photosynthetic pigments within the photosystems, leading to photoionisation where electrons are excited and released from the chlorophyll molecules.\n4) Energy from these released electrons is used for the synthesis of ATP from ADP and a phosphate group, and for the reduction of NADP to form reduced NADP. Both ATP and reduced NADP are essential for transferring energy and hydrogen, respectively, to the light-independent reaction.\n5) Concurrently, water (H2O) is oxidized to form oxygen (O2) as a byproduct.\n\nThe second stage of photosynthesis is the light-independent reaction, also known as the Calvin cycle:\n1) This stage doesn't require light energy directly, but it relies on the products of the light-dependent reaction.\n2) It occurs within the stroma of the chloroplast.\n3) Here, ATP and reduced NADP, which were produced during the light-dependent reaction, provide the necessary energy and hydrogen to convert CO2 into simple sugars.\n\n@@@Photophosphorylation in the Light-Dependent Reaction\nIn a more detailed explanation of the light-dependent reaction, the energy from photoionisation is utilized in three primary ways:\n1) To generate ATP from ADP and an inorganic phosphate through a process called photophosphorylation.\n2) To produce reduced NADP from NADP.\n3) To split water molecules into protons (H+ ions), electrons, and oxygen, a process known as photolysis.\nAdditionally, the light-dependent reaction includes two subtypes of photophosphorylation, non-cyclic and cyclic, which lead to different end products.\n\n@@@Overview of Photosynthesis and Respiration\nTopic 5A focuses on Photosynthesis and Respiration, linking the two reactions of photosynthesis within the chloroplast.

This can make it more difficult to breathe and reduce the rate of gas exchange.\n\n@@@Diagnostic Measures of Lung Function\n\nMeasures of Lung Function Can Help to Diagnose Lung DiseasesLung diseases affect both ventilation (breathing) and gas exchange in the lungs \u2014 in other words, how well the lungs function. Doctors can carry out tests to investigate lung function and diagnose a lung disease. You might be asked to interpret results from tests like these in your exams. Here are some terms you might come across:\n1) Tidal volume is the volume of air in each breath \u2014 usually between 0.4 dm* and 0.5 dm* for adults.\n2) Ventilation rate is the number of breaths per minute. For a healthy person at rest it's about 15 breaths.\n3) Forced expiratory volumet (FEV1) is the maximum volume of air that can be breathed out in 1 second.\n4) Forced vital capacity (FVC) is the maximum volume of air it is possible to breathe forcefully out of the lungs after a really deep breath in. \u201cstan s \u00b0r. z0\/1 - decimetres cubed, -X 1 dm3 is the same as a litre. :\n\nYou can figure out tidal volume, ventilation rate and other measures of breathing from the graph produced from a spirometer (a fancy machine that scientists and doctors use to measure the volume of air breathed in and out):9.\n\nMeasuring tidal volume is one of the hardest jobs in the world.\n\n@@@Pathologies and Their Impact on Breathing\n\nDifferent Diseases Affect the Lungs in Different WaysHere are some examples of different lung diseases and how they affect breathing.\n\nPulmonary Tuberculosis (TB)\n1) When someone becomes infected with tuberculosis bacteria, immune system cells build a wall around the bacteria in the lungs. This forms small, hard lumps known as tubercles.\n2) Infected tissue within the tubercles dies and the gaseous exchange surface is damaged, so tidal volume is decreased.\n3) Tuberculosis also causes fibrosis (see below), which further reduces the tidal volume.\n4) A reduced tidal volume means less air can be inhaled with each breath. In order to take in enough oxygen, patients have to breathe faster, i.e. ventilation rate is increased.\n5) Common symptoms include a persistent cough, coughing up blood and mucus, chest pains, shortness of breath and fatigue.\n\nFibrosis\n1) Fibrosis is the formation of scar tissue in the lungs.This can be the result of an infection or exposure to substances like asbestos or dust.\n2) Scar tissue is thicker and less elastic than normal lung tissue.\n3) This means that the lungs are less able to expand and so can't hold as much air as normal \u2014 tidal volume is reduced, and so is FVC (i.e. a smaller volume of air can be forcefully breathed out).\n4) There's a reduction in the rate of gaseous exchange \u2014 diffusion is slower across a thicker scarred membrane.\n5) Symptoms of fibrosis include shortness of breath, a dry cough, chest pain, fatigue and weakness.\n6) Fibrosis sufferers have a faster ventilation rate than normal \u2014 to get enough air into their lungs to oxygenate their blood.\n\nTopic 3A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems","140":"@@@ Introduction to Enzyme-Controlled Reactions and Experimentation Techniques \nScience isn't all about words and theory; it's also about getting your pipette dirty and making bad smells (in the name of discovery, of course). These pages show you how to measure the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction. \n\n@@@ Method 1: Measuring Product Formation Rate \nYou can measure the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction in a couple of ways. The first method involves measuring how fast the product of the reaction is produced. For example, catalase catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. You can measure the volume of oxygen produced to work out the rate at which it's given off. The necessary apparatus includes a measuring cylinder, a stand and clamp to hold the cylinder upside down, a stopwatch, and a water bath. \n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to the experiment:\n\n1. Set up boiling tubes containing the same volume and concentration of hydrogen peroxide.\n2. To keep the pH constant, add equal volumes of a suitable buffer solution to each tube.\n3. Assemble the rest of the apparatus as illustrated, placing each boiling tube in a water bath set to different temperatures along with another tube containing catalase enzyme.\n4. After allowing the enzyme to reach the temperature, add the same volume and concentration of catalase to each boiling tube, attach the bung and delivery tube quickly.\n5. Record the volume of oxygen produced in the first minute with a stopwatch.\n6. Repeat the experiment thrice at each temperature and calculate an average volume of oxygen produced.\n7. Determine the average rate of reaction at each temperature by dividing the oxygen volume by time taken (60 seconds), with the rate expressed in cm^3\/s.\n\nA control reaction without catalase should also be carried out at each temperature to validate the results.\n\n@@@ Method 2: Measuring Substrate Breakdown Rate \nThe second way to measure the rate of enzyme activity involves determining how quickly the substrate is broken down. Amylase, for example, catalyzes starch breakdown into maltose. To measure this, you set up an experiment where a drop of iodine in potassium iodide reacts with the mixture of amylase and starch in a test tube, causing a color change. The persistence of the dark blue-black color indicates the presence of starch. By recording the time it takes for the iodine solution to stop turning blue-black when the mixture is added, you gauge the rate at which amylase works. Repeating the experiment with different concentrations of amylase and doing it thrice per concentration improves the reliability of your results. \n\n@@@ Adapting Experiments to Investigate Various Factors \nThe experiments described above can be modified to investigate different variables that affect enzyme-controlled reactions like temperature and enzyme concentration. To study other factors such as pH, you could add buffer solutions with varying pH levels to the test tubes. Or, to explore the effect of substrate concentration, you could use serial dilutions to create substrate solutions at different concentrations. It's critical in such experiments to change only one variable at a time while keeping all other conditions constant.\n\n@@@ Topic Review \nThe last section of the text is a reminder that these experiments fall under the study of Biological Molecules, specifically within Topic 1A. This signifies the broader category under which enzyme experimentation is studied and contextualizes the importance of understanding biochemical interactions. \n\n(Note: Due to the formatting of the original text, presumptions were made to structure the information accurately.

The methods of leadership may vary among managers, and they may confront problems and make decisions quite differently, yet the fundamental functions of management remain consistent across all managers. Renowned management thinkers such as Fayol and Drucker have contributed to our understanding of these functions. By synthesizing their insights, we can outline the key tasks and functions of management.\n\n@@@Essential Management Tasks and Functions Defined\n\nA manager is responsible for setting objectives, organizing resources, and motivating staff to ensure that the organization's aims are achieved. The key functions of a manager include setting objectives and planning; organizing resources to meet objectives; directing and motivating staff; coordinating activities, and controlling and measuring performance against targets. All good managers plan ahead and develop strategic objectives that trickle down to tactical objectives for their team. In addition to planning to achieve these objectives, managers must organize resources and recruit people, encouraging them to take authority and accountability through delegation. Managers play an instrumental role in guiding and motivating staff to meet organizational goals and are acknowledged for the importance of staff development. Coordinating activities across different parts of the firm is essential, especially for large businesses or multinationals, to maintain consistency and avoid redundant efforts. Also, managers are responsible for controlling and measuring performance, ensuring targets are met, and providing feedback where necessary.\n\n@@@Roles of a Manager and the Importance of Leadership\n\nTo fulfill these management functions, managers must undertake various roles. Henry Mintzberg recognized ten roles essential to all managers, which he categorized into interpersonal, informational, and decisional roles. Another vital aspect of a successful manager is leadership, which involves setting a clear and often new direction for the organization that inspires others to follow. Leadership effectiveness can significantly impact a manager's ability to attract followers and manage a team effectively. The best managers are often the best leaders, but not all managers possess this quality. Focusing excessively on control and resource allocation can make a manager lose sight of providing a purpose or direction that others are willing to pursue. Even meticulously managed staff may lack inspiration if leadership fails to motivate or engage them to pursue new directions and achieve new goals. Leadership is described as the art of motivating a group of people towards a common objective.\n\n@@@Characteristics of Effective Leadership\n\nThe question of what constitutes a good leader has been extensively studied. Some argue that certain individuals are born with innate qualities that naturally attract followers, while others believe that leadership skills can be developed and learned. These studies aim to identify the key attributes that constitute effective leadership, whether they emerge from natural charisma or through acquired skills and training.","142":"@@@INTRODUCTION TO THE HEART\nAs I'm sure you know already, your heart is the 'pump' that gets oxygenated blood to your cells.

The right side only needs to get blood to the lungs, which are nearby.\n2) The ventricles have thicker walls than the atria, because they have to push blood out of the heart whereas the atria just need to push blood a short distance into the ventricles.\n3) The atrioventricular (AV) valves link the atria to the ventricles and stop blood flowing back into the atria when the ventricles contract.\n4) The semi-lunar (SL) valves link the ventricles to the pulmonary artery and aorta, and stop blood flowing back into the heart after the ventricles contract.\n5) The cords attach the atrioventricular valves to the ventricles to stop them being forced up into the atria when the ventricles contract.\nCaptain Jeff reckoned the lock gates were just like a big heart valve \u2014 with enough pressure he would be able to force his way through.\nThe valves only open one way \u2014 whether they're open or closed depends on the relative pressure of the heart chambers.\nIf there's higher pressure behind a valve, it's forced open, but if pressure is higher in front of the valve it's forced shut. This means blood only flows in one direction through the heart.\nThe text also includes a representation of pressure states with \"higher lower pressure pressure\" and \"lower higher pressure pressure\" indicating conditions when valves are closed or open, respectively.\n\n@@@TOPIC ANNOUNCEMENT FOR FURTHER STUDY\nTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n","143":"@@@Interpreting Lung Disease Data\nIt's very possible that you could be asked to interpret some data on lung disease in the exam. So being my usual nice self I've given you some examples to show you how to do it. I know it looks a bit dull but believe me, it'll really help.\n\n@@@Understanding Risk Factors and Lung Disease\nYou need to be able to interpret data on risk factors and lung disease. \n1) All diseases have factors that will increase a person's chance of getting that disease. These are called risk factors. For example, it's widely known that if you smoke you're more likely to get lung cancer (smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer).\n2) This is an example of a correlation \u2014 a link between two things (see page 213). However, a correlation doesn't always mean that one thing causes the other. Smokers have an increased risk of getting cancer but that doesn't necessarily mean smoking causes the disease \u2014 there are lots of other factors to take into consideration.\n3) You need to be able to describe and analyse data given to you in your exams.\n\n@@@Analyzing Statistical Data: Smoking and Lung Cancer Example\nHere's an example of the sort of thing you might get:\nEXAMPLE 1 \u2014 SMOKING AND LUNG CANCER\nThe provided graphs illustrate specific trends: the first graph presents the percentage of males aged 16 and over who smoked manufactured cigarettes in Great Britain from 1990 to 2012, and the second graph indicates age-standardised mortality rates for male lung cancer in the United Kingdom over similar years. From this visual data, several critical observations can be drawn.\n\n@@@Interpretation and Caution in Drawing Conclusions\nYou might be asked to:\n1) Describe the data \u2014 The graph on the left shows that the number of adult males in Great Britain who smoke decreased between 1990 and 2012. The graph on the right shows that the male lung cancer mortality (death) rate decreased between 1990 and 2012 in the United Kingdom.\n2) Draw conclusions \u2014 You need to be careful what you say here. There's a correlation (link) between the number of males who smoked and the mortality rate for male lung cancer. But you can't say that one caused the other. There could be other reasons for the trend, e.g., deaths due to lung cancer may have decreased because less asbestos was being used in homes (not because fewer people were smoking).\nOther points to consider \u2014 The graph on the right shows mortality (death) rates. The rate of cases of lung cancer may have been increasing but medical advances may mean more people were surviving (so only mortality was decreasing).\n\n@@@Impact of Scientific Data on Public Policy\nYou might also need to evaluate the way in which scientific data has led to government restrictions on the sources of risk factors. E.g.\nResponses to data\nMedical studies in the 1950s and 1960s documented the link between smoking and various forms of cancer, particularly lung cancer. The evidence prompted the first voluntary agreement between the UK government and tobacco companies in 1971, which stated that tobacco products and adverts should carry a health warning label. As of October 2008, picture health warnings were made compulsory on all UK boxes of cigarettes after studies suggested they were more effective than written warnings alone.\n\n@@@Topic 3A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\nThis portion of the text refers to \"Topic 3A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems,\" suggesting a shift to a new section or chapter in the source material.","144":"@@@SPECIFICATION REFERENCE FOR ATHEROSCLEROSIS\n1BSPECIFICATION REFERENCE5 A THEROSCLEROSIS\n\n@@@LEARNING OBJECTIVES RELATED TO ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n \u25fcUnderstand the course of events that lead to atherosclerosis.\n\n@@@THE IMPACT OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES GLOBALLY\nCARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES\nProblems with the cardiovascular system have serious consequences. Globally, almost 18 million people die from cardiovascular diseases each year. World Health Organization (WHO) data from 2017 show that cardiovascular diseases were responsible for 31% of all global deaths \u2013 it is the single biggest cause of death and disability (see fig A). What is more, around a third of these deaths were in people younger than 70.\nMany cardiovascular diseases are linked to a condition called atherosclerosis.\n\n@@@INTRODUCTION TO ATHEROSCLEROSIS AND ITS DEVELOPMENT\nATHEROSCLEROSIS\nAtherosclerosis, a hardening of the arteries, is a disease in which plaques (made of a yellowish fatty substance) build up on the inside of arteries. It can begin in late childhood and continues throughout life. A plaque can continue to develop until it restricts the flow of blood through the artery or even blocks it completely. Plaques are most likely to form in the arteries of the heart (coronary arteries) and neck (carotid arteries). The typical development of a plaque is summarised in fig B.\nartery walls\nSlight damage to the endothelial cells lining the artery leads to an inflammatory response, followed by a build-up of cholesterol. Smooth normal endothelium\nThe fatty deposits grow to form an atheroma. Fibrous tissue and calcium salts build up around the atheroma forming a hardened plaque which narrows the artery and makes the walls rigid.\n\u25b2 fig B The development of atherosclerosis\n\n@@@DETAILED LOOK AT ATHEROSCLEROSIS PATHOGENESIS\nWe can now look at this development in more detail. Atherosclerosis begins with damage to the endothelial lining of blood vessels. This damage can be caused by several factors, including high blood pressure and substances in tobacco smoke. Atherosclerosis usually occurs in arteries rather than in veins. This is because the blood in the arteries flows fast under relatively high pressure, which puts more strain on the endothelial lining of the vessels and can cause small areas of damage. In the veins, the pressure is lower so damage to the endothelium is much less likely.\n\n@@@WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DATA ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES\ncardiovascular diseases\n31%\n27%9%33%communicable (infectious)\ndiseases, childbirth and nutritional conditions \ninjuries\nall other causes\ncardiovascular diseases\n31%\n27%9%33%communicable (infectious)\ndiseases, childbirth and nutritional conditions \ninjuries\nall other causes\n\u25b2 fig A This WHO data from 2017 shows cardiovascular disease is the biggest single cause of death around the world.\n\n@@@LEARNING TIP FOR UNDERSTANDING ENDOTHELIAL DAMAGE \nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that damage to the endothelium occurs first and this is often caused by high blood pressure, often as a result of smoking.\n\n@@@EXAM HINT ON ATHEROSCLEROSIS STAGES\nEXAM HINT\nLearn the stages of the development of atherosclerosis: damage to the endothelium of the arteries \u2192 inflammatory response \u2192 accumulation of cholesterol \u2192 atheroma \u2192 fibrous tissue\/calcium salts \u2192 plaque \u2192 narrowing\/loss of elasticity of the artery.\n\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

It sets the tone for the reader to have their notepad ready and signals the commencement with a playful analogy to a movie set-up, indicating the complexity and dynamic nature of how neurones work within the nervous system.\n\n@@@Resting State of Neurone Cell Membranes and Polarisation\nNeurone Cell Membranes are Polarised at Rest delves into the specific details of a neurone's resting state, which occurs when the neurone is not actively being stimulated. The section explains the polarization of the membrane, which refers to the electrical charge difference across the membrane, called potential difference or voltage. This resting potential is stated to be about -70 mV (millivolts). The explanation continues with the mechanisms that maintain this resting potential, namely the sodium-potassium pumps and the potassium ion channels. The pumps actively transport sodium ions out and potassium ions in, creating an electrochemical gradient, while the potassium channels allow potassium to diffuse back out, contributing to the positive charge outside the cell. Importantly, the text points out that the sodium-potassium pumps require ATP for this active transport.\n\n@@@Action Potentials and Neurone Stimulation\nNeurone Cell Membranes Become Depolarised when They\u2019re Stimulated addresses the process that occurs when a neurone is activated by a stimulus. The sodium ion channels open in response to the stimulus, causing the membrane to become more permeable to sodium, allowing sodium ions to diffuse into the neurone. This sequence of events is known as an action potential. The steps of an action potential are outlined, including depolarisation, threshold potential, repolarisation, and the role of sodium and potassium ions. The graph provided shows the change in potential difference over time after a stimulus is applied, marking the important milestones in the action potential process, such as reaching the threshold and the repolarization phase that returns the neuron toward its resting state. The concept of these ion channels' selective permeability and the electrochemical gradients are crucial for understanding how action potentials propagate along neurones.","146":"@@@SPECIFICATION REFERENCE: THE CHEMISTRY OF LIFE - SECTION 1A\nThe study of Biology is foundational to understanding the chemistry of life, with a focus on living things that are comprised of various chemicals. Knowing the basics of chemistry enhances the comprehension of biological systems. The chemical bonds within and between molecules influence the properties and functions of compounds in cells and organisms. The relevance of knowing chemical bonds, including the creation of dipoles within molecules, is underscored when examining the chemistry of water, which is essential to all forms of life, just as it supports the dragonfly perched on a plant or a cow requiring salt, as depicted in figures A and C.\n\n@@@LEARNING OBJECTIVES: UNDERSTANDING CHEMICAL BONDS\nOne of the fundamental concepts in chemistry is the behavior of atoms in forming compounds. Atoms, which consist of a nucleus with protons and neutrons and are surrounded by orbiting electrons, seek stability typically achieved by having a full outer shell. Atoms without this full outer shell partake in chemical reactions, potentially through ionic bonding, to attain stability.\n\n@@@IONIC BONDING: THE FORMATION OF IONS AND ATOM INTERACTIONS\nIonic bonding is a process where atoms either donate or accept electrons, leading to the formation of charged particles known as ions. Specifically, an atom that gains electrons becomes an anion, exhibiting a negative charge, while an atom that loses electrons becomes a cation, with a positive charge. These ions, with their opposite charges, attract each other and form solid ionic bonds. The creation of sodium chloride or table salt is a commonly understood example of this type of bonding, demonstrating the essential role such compounds play in the livelihood of living organisms.","147":"@@@Antibodies in Medicine\n\nAntibodies aren't only great for fighting off infection, they're also excellent tools for use in medical diagnosis and drug development.

This helps them to survive in their environment.\n\n@@@Plants Need to Respond to Stimuli Too\n\nFlowering plants, like animals, increase their chances of survival by responding to changes in their environment, for example:\n- They sense the direction of light and grow towards it to maximise light absorption for photosynthesis.\n- They can sense gravity, so their roots and shoots grow in the right direction.\n- Climbing plants have a sense of touch, so they can find things to climb up and reach the sunlight.\n\n@@@A Tropism is a Plant\u2019s Growth Response to an External Stimulus\n\n1) A tropism is the response of a plant to a directional stimulus (a stimulus coming from a particular direction).\n2) Plants respond to stimuli by regulating their growth.\n3) A positive tropism is growth towards the stimulus.\n4) A negative tropism is growth away from the stimulus.\n\nPhototropism is the growth of a plant in response to light.

Shoot IAA concentration increases on the shaded side \u2014 cells elongate and the shoot bends towards the light. In roots, the IAA concentration increases on the shaded side \u2014 growth is inhibited so the root bends away from the light.\nGravitropism \u2014 IAA moves to the underside of shoots and roots, so there's uneven growth.

Before we go on, it will be useful to explain some important business terms that have either already been used, or will be referred to soon, in this chapter. Business activity exists to produce consumer goods or services that meet the needs of customers. These goods and services can be classified in several ways.\n\n@@@Classification of Goods and Services Offered to the Public\nConsumer goods: the physical and tangible goods sold to the general public \u2013 they include durable consumer goods, such as cars and washing machines, and non-durable consumer goods, such as food, drinks and sweets that can be used only once.\nConsumer services: the non-tangible products sold to the general public \u2013 they include hotel accommodation, insurance services and train journeys.\n\n@@@Key Business Terms\nKEY TERMS\n\n@@@Essential Resources for Producing Goods and Services\nWhat do businesses need to produce goods and services?\nFactors of production\nThese are the resources needed by businesses to produce goods or services. They include:\n- Land \u2013 this general term includes not only land itself but all of the renewable and non-renewable resources of nature, such as coal, crude oil and timber.\n- Labour \u2013 manual and skilled labour make up the workforce of the business.\n- Capital \u2013 this is not just the finance needed to set up a business and pay for its continuing operations, but also all of the man-made resources used in production. These include capital goods, such as computers, machines, factories, offices and vehicles.\n- Enterprise \u2013 this is the driving force, provided by risk-taking individuals, that combines the other factors of production into a unit capable of producing goods and services.

If a customer is prepared to pay a price that is greater than the cost of materials used in making or providing a good or service, then the business has been successful in creating value. This can also be referred to as \u2018adding value\u2019. The difference between the selling price of the products sold by a business and the cost of the materials that it bought in is called \u2018added value\u2019. Without creating value a business will not be able to survive as other costs have to be covered as well.\n\nCreating value: increasing the difference between the cost of purchasing bought-in materials and the price the finished goods are sold for.\nAdded value: the difference between the cost of purchasing bought-in materials and the price the finished goods are sold for.\n\nKEY TERMS\n4 Cambridge International AS and A Level Business","151":"@@@Genetic Diversity and Natural Selection: Natural Selection Increases Advantageous Alleles in a Population\nRandomly-occurring mutations sometimes result in a new allele being formed. This can be harmful, which usually means that the mutated allele quickly dies out. However, some mutations can produce alleles that are beneficial to an organism (e.g. a protein is produced that works better than the original), helping the organism to survive in certain environments. When the allele codes for a characteristic that increases the chances of an organism surviving, its frequency within the population can increase. This process is known as natural selection. Here's how it works: 1) Not all individuals are as likely to reproduce as each other. There's differential reproductive success in a population\u2014individuals that have an allele that increases their chance of survival are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on their genes (including the beneficial allele), than individuals with different alleles. 2) This means that a greater proportion of the next generation inherits the beneficial allele. 3) They, in turn, are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on their genes. 4) So the frequency of the beneficial allele increases from generation to generation. 5) Over generations this leads to evolution as the advantageous alleles become more common in the population. Adaptation and selection are both key factors in evolution\u2014the gradual change in species over time. Evolution has led to the huge diversity of living organisms on Earth.\n\n@@@Natural Selection Leads to Populations Becoming Better Adapted Through Various Adaptations\nAdaptations help organisms to survive in their environment. They can be behavioural, physiological, or anatomical. Here are some examples: (1) Behavioural adaptations are ways an organism acts that increase its chance of survival and reproduction. For example, possums sometimes 'play dead' if they're being threatened by a predator to escape attack. (2) Physiological adaptations are processes inside an organism's body that increase its chance of survival. For example, brown bears hibernate over winter. They lower their rate of metabolism (all the chemical reactions taking place in their body). This conserves energy, so they don't need to look for food in the months when it's scarce. (3) Anatomical adaptations are structural features of an organism's body that increase its chance of survival. For example, whales have a thick layer of blubber (fat) which helps them keep warm in the cold sea. Bob and Sue were well adapted to hiding in candyfloss shops.\n\n@@@Practice and Exam Questions on Genetic Diversity, Adaptations, and Evolution\nPractice Questions\nQ1 What is genetic diversity?\nQ2 Explain how a genetic bottleneck reduces genetic diversity.\nQ3 Give an example of a behavioural adaptation.\n\nExam Question\nQ1 Tawny owls show variation in colour.

Instead, we delve into genetic inheritance, examining how traits and characteristics are passed down from parents to their offspring through genes.\n\n@@@Key Genetic Terminology\nUnderstanding genetics requires familiarity with essential terms. The term 'Gene' refers to a DNA sequence coding for a protein, which directly influences a characteristic such as eye color. An 'Allele' is a gene variant, and while numerous alleles of a gene can exist, diploid organisms like humans carry just two per gene\u2014one from each parent. The alleles' sequence of bases varies slightly, coding for different versions of a trait. 'Genotype' stands for an organism's genetic makeup and its specific alleles, whereas 'Phenotype' is the genotype's tangible expression, coupled with environmental influences. Alleles can be 'Dominant', evident in the phenotype with just one copy, or 'Recessive', only visible when two copies are possessed. 'Codominant' alleles are both explicitly expressed, and each gene's 'Locus' is its fixed chromosome position. An organism with matching alleles ('Homozygote') may have a 'Heterozygote' counterpart carrying two different alleles. A 'Carrier' harbors an allele which, while not phenotypically expressed, is inheritable.\n\n@@@Genetic Diagrams and Monohybrid Inheritance\nGenetic diagrams play a crucial role in visualizing the potential genotypes of progeny. Because diploid organisms, including humans, have matched sets of chromosomes, they have a pair of alleles for each gene. In contrast, gametes hold only one allele per gene. Upon the fusion of two parental gametes, their combined alleles determine the offspring's genotype, which may be homozygous or heterozygous. Genetic diagrams assist in forecasting offspring genotypes and phenotypes of various parental crosses. Such diagrams are particularly helpful in monohybrid inheritance, the inheritance pattern of a trait controlled by a single gene, indicating offspring probabilities with certain parentage. A classic example is the inherited wing length in fruit flies. Here the dominant allele for regular wings (N) overtakes the recessive vestigial (n) wing allele. A union between a homozygous normal-winged (NN) and a homozygous vestigial-winged (nn) parent would produce heterozygous (Nn) F1 offspring. These F1 offspring could, in turn, yield both normal and vestigial-winged F2 offspring, yet a 3:1 normal to vestigial ratio is statistically expected. This predictable outcome is characteristic of monohybrid crosses, yielding a dominant to recessive ratio of 3:1 with two heterozygous parents.","153":"@@@Examples of Creating Added Value in Different Businesses\n\nHere are two examples of how different businesses could create added value to their products:\n\n1.

As we cannot satisfy all of our wants, then we must choose those which we will satisfy now and those which we will forgo. If we are careful and rational, we will choose those things that give us the greatest benefit, leaving out those things of less value to us. This need to choose is not exclusive to people as consumers. All economic units have to make choices \u2013 governments, businesses, workers, charities, and so on.\n\n@@@Key Term: Opportunity Cost\n\nOpportunity cost: This need to choose leads to the next important principle of our subject \u2013 opportunity cost. In deciding to purchase or obtain one item, we must give up other goods as they become the next most desired option that is given up. For example, \n\n- If the government chooses to build the fighter plane, then the hospital becomes the opportunity cost.\n- If consumers choose to buy the smartphone, then the trainers become the opportunity cost.","154":"@@@Introduction: The Promises of Stem Cell Research and Medicine\nStem cells hold immense potential for medical treatments, offering large benefits to human health. Decision-makers in the medical field must evaluate the prospective advantages of stem cell therapies. Such therapies can potentially save numerous lives, particularly those of patients on lengthy organ transplant waiting lists who might perish before a suitable donor organ is found. Stem cells present an opportunity to potentially grow organs for these individuals. Moreover, stem cell therapies could markedly enhance the quality of life for many, for example, by replacing the damaged cells in the eyes of blind individuals, thereby restoring their sight.\n\n@@@Sources of Human Stem Cells: Adult Tissue and Embryos\nScientists have identified three primary sources of human stem cells, each with its own set of attributes and challenges. Adult stem cells, which can be gathered from the tissues of grown individuals, like those found in bone marrow, present a low-risk albeit uncomfortable procurement method. They possess the disadvantage of being multipotent, meaning they are limited in the types of cells they can specialize into, unlike embryonic stem cells. Embryonic stem cells, harvested from embryos at a nascent stage of development, can be created in a laboratory setting through in vitro fertilization (IVF). Although embryonic stem cells can differentiate into any type of body cell due to their pluripotency, their extraction destroys the embryo and raises ethical concerns.\n\n@@@Advancements in Stem Cell Technology: Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells\nThe field of stem cell research has advanced with the creation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), which are engineered in laboratories. This innovative process involves reverting specialized adult body cells back to a pluripotent state, thus mirroring the versatile nature of embryonic stem cells. This reprogramming is achieved by inducing adult cells to express transcription factors associated with pluripotence. These factors are often introduced via infection with a genetically modified virus containing the necessary genes. Despite the promise iPS cells hold for research and medicine, further study is required to confirm their similarity to natural pluripotent embryonic stem cells and realize their full potential in clinical applications.\n\n@@@Topic Overview: Genetic Variations and Their Impact\nThe discussion on stem cells and their varying sources is closely related to broader themes in biology, such as mutations and gene expression. These topics explore the genetic mechanisms that underlie the development and specialization of cells, including stem cells. As we delve into the complexities of genetics, understanding these processes becomes crucial for advancements in biotechnology and treatments for genetic disorders.","155":"@@@Control of Blood Glucose Concentration and Homeostasis\nHomeostasis doesn't always work. One example of this is diabetes, which occurs when blood glucose concentration is not controlled. Diabetes mellitus is a condition where blood glucose concentration can't be controlled properly. There are two main types of diabetes:\n\n@@@Type I Diabetes: Autoimmune Assault on Insulin Production\nType I diabetes is where the immune system attacks the beta cells in the islets of Langerhans, rendering them unable to produce any insulin. The exact cause of this autoimmune reaction is not clear, but there is evidence of genetic predisposition and potential triggering by a viral infection. After eating, individuals with Type I diabetes experience a rise in blood glucose levels that remains high, a state known as hyperglycaemia, which can be fatal if not treated. As a result, glucose may be excreted in urine. \n\nManagement of this condition commonly involves regular insulin injections or the use of an insulin pump for continuous insulin delivery. Care must be taken with insulin therapy to prevent hypoglycaemia, a dangerous drop in blood glucose. Dietary control, specifically managing the intake of sugars, contributes to managing blood glucose levels.\n\n@@@Type II Diabetes: Lifestyle Factors and Insulin Resistance\nType II diabetes usually develops later in life, often associated with obesity, and is influenced by family history, lack of exercise, aging, and poor diet. This condition develops when beta cells do not produce enough insulin or when body cells do not properly respond to insulin due to malfunctioning insulin receptors. This leads to abnormally high blood glucose levels. \n\nTreatment for Type II diabetes includes maintaining a healthy balanced diet, losing weight if necessary, engaging in regular exercise, and using glucose-lowering medication. In some cases, insulin injections may become required.\n\n@@@Type II Diabetes as a Growing Health Concern\nThe prevalence of Type II diabetes is increasing in the UK, attributed to rising obesity levels, unhealthy diets, and low physical activity. If not managed, the condition can lead to serious complications like visual impairment and kidney failure. Health advisors are thus proactive in promoting awareness of the risks and advocating for prevention measures.\n\nRecommendations to lower the risk of Type II diabetes include a diet low in fats, sugars, and salt with plenty of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; regular exercise; and weight management. Public health campaigns, such as the NHS's 'Change4Life', educate on healthier diets and lifestyles to prevent conditions such as Type II diabetes.\n\n@@@Addressing the Role of the Food Industry in Diabetes Prevention\nIn addition to lifestyle changes, there is ongoing debate about the role of the food industry in the prevention of Type II diabetes. Calls for action involve reducing the marketing of unhealthy food, particularly to children, improving nutritional values, and implementing clearer product labeling. In response, some companies have begun to use sugar alternatives, and reducing the sugar, fat, and salt content in their products. Critics argue that changes will take time and depend on shifting public perceptions towards healthy eating. Moreover, there is skepticism about artificial sweeteners and their link to weight gain, challenging the notion that diet products are beneficial for health.","156":"@@@OVERVIEW OF SYLLABUS AND INTRODUCTION TO THE TATA NANO CASE STUDY\nThis chapter covers syllabus section AS Level 1.5. It introduces the \"Tata Nano - Which stakeholders benefit from it?\" case study to analyze the roles, rights, and responsibilities of key business stakeholders and the concept of corporate social responsibility. The Tata Nano, labelled the 'People\u2019s Car', is three meters long, seats four, does 100 kilometers an hour and, when launched, aimed to revolutionize travel for millions with its affordability. The expectation was to enable Asia\u2019s emerging middle classes to purchase a car for the first time, thus changing the way people travel in India and Asia. Despite the initial vision, the sales were disappointing and the car is being relaunched with improvements to meet profit goals for shareholders.\n\n@@@STAKEHOLDER BENEFITS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS\nThe Nano offers numerous benefits to various stakeholders: it provides relatively well-paid factory jobs in West Bengal, generates export revenue for India when sold abroad, and supports Asian suppliers in the production materials sector. However, the car provokes concerns from environmental groups, with fears of increased air pollution levels, traffic congestion, and the potential need for more infrastructure developments like roads. These concerns are emphasized in the context of Delhi registering a large number of new cars, leading to environmental and operational challenges such as reduced average traffic speeds during rush hour.\n\n@@@STAKEHOLDER IMPACT DISCUSSION POINTS\nAs readers progress through the chapter, they are encouraged to consider the impact of Nano production and the proliferation of small, cheap cars on different groups of people. They are prompted to think about whether Tata should work to mitigate potential conflicts between the interests of various stakeholders.\n\n@@@LEARNING OUTCOMES\nOn completing this chapter, readers will have gained an understanding of the term 'stakeholder', the interplay between different stakeholder interests, and the importance of considering those interests in business decision-making processes. They will also learn to evaluate how a business can recognize and address conflicts arising from competing stakeholder objectives.\n\n@@@TOPIC AND CASE STUDY DETAILS\nIntroducing the topic of stakeholders in a business under section 5 and examining the cost-effectiveness of the Nano under section 51 round up the coverage of the learning material, setting the scene for a deep dive into stakeholder analysis and the implications of producing low-cost vehicles in emerging markets.","157":"@@@Understanding the Immune System's Role in Fighting Disease\nAn infectious disease is one that is caused by pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Infectious diseases can be really nasty, but luckily there's an army of cells in the body that helps to protect us \u2014 the immune system.\n\n@@@The Role of Antigens in Triggering an Immune Response\nAntigens are molecules (usually proteins) that can generate an immune response when detected by the body. They are usually found on the surface of cells and are used by the immune system to identify pathogens (organisms that cause disease), abnormal body cells (e.g., cancerous or pathogen-infected cells, which have abnormal antigens on their surface), toxins, and cells from other individuals of the same species (e.g., organ transplants). There are four main stages in the immune response:\n\n@@@Stage 1: Phagocytes Engulf Pathogens\n1) A phagocyte (e.g., a macrophage) is a type of white blood cell that carries out phagocytosis (engulfment of pathogens). They're found in the blood and in tissues and are the first cells to respond to an immune system trigger inside the body. Here's how they work:\n2) A phagocyte recognizes the foreign antigens on a pathogen.\n3) The cytoplasm of the phagocyte moves around the pathogen, engulfing it.\n4) The pathogen is now contained in a phagocytic vacuole (a bubble) in the cytoplasm of the phagocyte.\n5) A lysosome (an organelle that contains enzymes called lysozymes) fuses with the phagocytic vacuole. The lysozymes break down the pathogen.\n6) The phagocyte then presents the pathogen's antigens \u2014 it sticks the antigens on its surface to activate other immune system cells.\n\n@@@Stage 2: Phagocytes Activate T-cells\nA T-cell (also called a T-lymphocyte) is another type of white blood cell. It has receptor proteins on its surface that bind to complementary antigens presented to it by phagocytes. This activates the T-cell. Different types of T-cells respond in different ways. For example, helper T-cells (TH cells) release chemical signals that activate and stimulate phagocytes and cytotoxic T-cells (Tc cells), which kill abnormal and foreign cells. B-cells, which secrete antibodies (see below). TH cells also activate B-cells.\n\n@@@Stage 3: T-cells Activate B-cells, Which Divide into Plasma Cells\nB-cells (also called B-lymphocytes) are also a type of white blood cell. They're covered with antibodies \u2014 proteins that bind antigens to form an antigen-antibody complex. Each B-cell has a different shaped antibody on its membrane, so different ones bind to different shaped antigens.\n1) When the antibody on the surface of a B-cell meets a complementary shaped antigen, it binds to it.\n2) This, together with substances released from helper T-cells, activates the B-cell. This process is called clonal selection.\n3) The activated B-cell divides into plasma cells.\n\n@@@Stage 4: Plasma Cells Make More Antibodies to a Specific Antigen\nPlasma cells are identical to the B-cell (they're clones). They secrete loads of antibodies specific to the antigen. These are called monoclonal antibodies. They bind to the antigens on the surface of the pathogen to form lots of antigen-antibody complexes. An antibody has two binding sites, so can bind to two pathogens at the same time. This means that pathogens become clumped together \u2014 this is called agglutination. Phagocytes then bind to the antibodies and phagocytose many pathogens at once. This process leads to the destruction of pathogens carrying this antigen in the body.\n\nAntibodies are proteins \u2014 they're made up of chains of amino acids. The specificity of an antibody depends on its variable regions, which form the antigen binding sites. Each antibody has a variable region with a unique tertiary structure (due to different amino acid sequences) that's complementary to one specific antigen. All antibodies have the same constant regions.\n\nTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System","158":"@@@INTRODUCTION TO CELL MEMBRANE STRUCTURE\nYou might remember a bit about cell membranes from page 25. Well, now it's time to delve a little deeper.\n\n@@@MEMBRANES AS CONTROLLERS OF CELLULAR TRAFFIC\nAll cells are surrounded by cell-surface membranes which act as a barrier between the cell and its environment, controlling which substances enter and leave the cell. They're partially permeable, meaning they let some molecules through but not others. Substances can pass across cell-surface membranes by diffusion, osmosis, or active transport (see pages 38-43). Additionally, the membranes around organelles divide the cell into different compartments, acting as a barrier between the organelle and the cytoplasm, and are also partially permeable, controlling the movement of substances into and out of the organelle.\n\n@@@'FLUID MOSAIC' MODEL OF CELL MEMBRANES\nThe basic structure of all cell membranes is composed of lipids (mainly phospholipids \u2014 see page 7), proteins, and carbohydrates (attached to proteins or lipids). The 'fluid mosaic' model was suggested in 1972 to describe the arrangement of molecules in the membrane, where phospholipid molecules form a continuous double layer that is fluid because the phospholipids are constantly moving. The bilayer also includes cholesterol molecules within it, proteins scattered through it like tiles in a mosaic, including channel proteins and carrier proteins that allow large molecules and ions to pass through. Receptor proteins on the cell-surface membrane allow for detection of chemicals from other cells, signaling a response, such as insulin binding to liver cells, prompting them to absorb glucose. Some proteins can move sideways through the bilayer, while others are fixed in place. Glycoproteins and glycolipids are proteins and lipids, respectively, with a polysaccharide chain attached.\n\n@@@FUNCTIONS OF THE COMPONENTS OF CELL MEMBRANES\nPhospholipids form a barrier to dissolved substances by having a hydrophilic 'head' and a hydrophobic 'tail', arranging themselves into a bilayer with the hydrophobic tails facing inwards. This hydrophobic center acts as a barrier to water-soluble substances, like ions. Cholesterol gives the membrane stability by fitting between the phospholipids and binding to their hydrophobic tails, causing them to pack closer together and restrict their movement. This makes the membrane less fluid and more rigid, helping to maintain the shape of animal cells, especially for cells that are not supported by other cells, such as red blood cells that float free in the blood.","159":"@@@Synaptic Transmission: Neurotransmitters Can Be Excitatory, Inhibitory or Both\nNeurotransmitters play a crucial role in synaptic transmission, influencing whether a postsynaptic neuron will fire an action potential or not, based on the type of neurotransmitter released. Excitatory neurotransmitters depolarize the postsynaptic membrane, pushing it towards the threshold required to trigger an action potential. Acetylcholine serves as an example of an excitatory neurotransmitter at cholinergic synapses in the central nervous system (CNS) and neuromuscular junctions. Conversely, inhibitory neurotransmitters hyperpolarize the postsynaptic membrane, increasing the potential difference and preventing the firing of an action potential. For instance, acetylcholine acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter at cholinergic synapses in the heart, where it may open potassium ion channels, leading to hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic membrane.\n\n@@@Summation at Synapses Finely Tunes the Nervous Response\nThe process of summation is essential in determining whether the postsynaptic membrane will fire an action potential. A weak stimulus may release insufficient neurotransmitter to reach the threshold. Summation occurs when the effects of neurotransmitters from several neurons (or repeated stimulation from a single neuron) add up. There are two types of summation:\n\n1. Spatial summation involves the cumulative effect of neurotransmitters released from multiple neurons.\n2. Temporal summation occurs when nerve impulses arrive in rapid succession from the same presynaptic neuron, heightening the likelihood of reaching the threshold due to the increased release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft.\n\nBoth forms of summation enable synapses to process information with precision, thereby fine-tuning the nervous response.\n\n@@@Neuromuscular Junctions: Synapses Between Neurons and Muscles\nNeuromuscular junctions are specialized synapses between motor neurons and muscle cells. These junctions utilize acetylcholine (ACh) as the neurotransmitter, which binds to cholinergic receptors known as nicotinic cholinergic receptors. Though they function similarly to cholinergic synapses, neuromuscular junctions have distinctive features such as:\n- Postsynaptic membrane folds that form clefts storing the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which breaks down ACh.\n- A higher concentration of receptors than found in other synapses.\n- Acetylcholine's consistent excitatory effect at a neuromuscular junction, typically triggering a response in a muscle cell upon the firing of an action potential by a motor neuron.\n\nThis differs from synapses between two neurons, where the response can vary. The user is expected to understand the comparison between transmission across a cholinergic synapse and a neuromuscular junction.\n\n@@@Transmission Influenced by the Collective Effects of Neurons\nThe cumulative effect of neurotransmitters from multiple neurons onto a single postsynaptic neuron can be sufficient to reach the threshold and provoke an action potential. However, if the neurotransmitters released are inhibitory, the collective impact could negate the potential for an action potential. The balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters released determines the overall outcome:\n- When more inhibitory neurotransmitters are released than excitatory ones, no action potential results.\n- Conversely, the release of neurotransmitters by numerous neurons can lead to the firing of an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron.","160":"@@@Introduction to Respiration and Its Relevance\nRespiration is a vital biological process that you might find as enjoyable as the colors of roses and violets expressed in poetry. The reactions involved in respiration are crucial for life, and understanding these reactions is essential for anyone interested in biology.\n\n@@@Overview of Respiration Types\nThere are two primary forms of respiration: aerobic, which requires oxygen, and anaerobic, which does not. Both types of respiration serve the purpose of producing ATP, the energy currency of the cell, although aerobic respiration is more efficient in this regard. Regardless of the presence of oxygen, both forms begin with glycolysis, setting the stage for the subsequent processes that ultimately yield energy.\n\n@@@Glycolysis: The First Common Stage\nGlycolysis is the initial stage of both aerobic and anaerobic respiration. During glycolysis, a molecule of glucose, which contains six carbon atoms, is split into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. This process occurs in the cell's cytoplasm and does not require oxygen, making it a universally anaerobic procedure regardless of the respiration pathway that follows.\n\n@@@The Two-Part Process of Glycolysis\nThe process of glycolysis can be broken down into two main stages: phosphorylation and oxidation. Initially, ATP molecules donate phosphates to glucose, transforming it into a more reactive form. This is followed by the oxidative phase, where the newly formed triose phosphate is oxidised, and ATP is generated. After accounting for the ATP consumed in phosphorylation, there is a net gain of ATP, contributing to the cell's energy supply.\n\n@@@Transition from Glycolysis to Aerobic Respiration\nIn the presence of oxygen, the journey of the pyruvate molecules continues as they are transported into the mitochondria. Once there, further reactions take place that significantly amplify the production of ATP. This series of reactions, beginning with the link reaction and followed by the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, constitutes the aerobic pathway.\n\n@@@Anaerobic Pathways: Alternative Conversions of Pyruvate\nWhen oxygen is scarce, cells resort to anaerobic respiration. In this alternative pathway, the pyruvate from glycolysis is transformed into different substances based on the organism. In plants and yeast, the process results in the formation of ethanol, while in animals and some bacteria, lactate is produced. This conversion serves an important purpose: it regenerates oxidised NAD, which is critical for glycolysis to persist even under low oxygen conditions, ensuring survival by providing a small but vital amount of ATP.\n\n@@@Connecting Photosynthesis and Respiration\nUnderstanding the intricate processes of respiration is complemented by an examination of photosynthesis. Both respiratory pathways underscore the complexity and adaptability of biological systems in harnessing and utilizing energy to power life itself. These fundamental processes are intertwined, with photosynthesis playing a mirror-like role in converting light energy into chemical energy that can be used by plants, which ultimately becomes the fuel for cellular respiration in other organisms.","161":"@@@DNA REPLICATION OVERVIEW\nDNA has the amazing ability to replicate (copy) itself. These pages cover the facts behind the replication mechanism, as well as some of the history behind its discovery. This stuff is really clever. Honest.\n\n@@@SEMI-CONSERVATIVE REPLICATION PROCESS\nDNA Replicates by Semi-Conservative Replication. DNA copies itself before cell division (see p. 32) so that each new cell has the full amount of DNA. The method is called semi-conservative replication because half of the strands in each new DNA molecule are from the original DNA molecule. This means that there's genetic continuity between generations of cells (i.e., the cells produced by cell division inherit their genes from their parent cells).\n\n1) The enzyme DNA helicase breaks the hydrogen bonds between bases on the two polynucleotide DNA strands. This makes the helix unwind to form two single strands. Breaks the hydrogen bonds.\n\n2) Each original single strand acts as a template for a new strand. Complementary base pairing means that free-floating DNA nucleotides are attracted to their complementary exposed bases on each original template strand \u2014 A with T and C with G. Bases match up using complementary base pairing. Gerald doesn't need helicase to unwind. He just needs a beach full of seals.\n\n3) Condensation reactions join the nucleotides of the new strands together \u2014 catalysed by the enzyme DNA polymerase. Hydrogen bonds form between the bases on the original and new strands. DNA polymerase joins the nucleotides. Hydrogen bonds form between the strands.\n\n4) Each new DNA molecule contains one strand from the original DNA molecule and one new strand. New strand-TA--TA--AT--AT--G:C--G::C- Original-G:C--G:C-DNA strand-A T--A T-SsS3\n\n@@@DIRECTIONALITY OF DNA POLYMERASE\nDNA Polymerase Moves in Opposite Ways Along Antiparallel DNA Strands. Each end of a DNA strand is slightly different in its structure. One end is called the 3' (pronounced 'three prime') end and one end is called the 5' (five prime) end. In a DNA helix, the strands run in opposite directions \u2014 they're antiparallel. The active site of DNA polymerase is only complementary to the 3' end of the newly forming DNA strand \u2014 so the enzyme can only add nucleotides to the new strand at the 3' end. This means that the new strand is made in a 5' to 3' direction and that 3'- DNA polymerase moves down the template strand in a 3' to 5' direction. Because the strands in the double helix are antiparallel, the DNA polymerase working on one of the template strands moves in the opposite direction to the DNA polymerase working on the other template strand.\n\n@@@ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nDNA Polymerase Topic 1B \u2014 More Biological Molecules","162":"@@@RISK, CORRELATION AND CAUSE IN CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH\nIf you know the number of people in a population who are affected by a disease, it is possible to calculate the average risk of developing that disease for a person within that population. But the risk is higher for some people than others, depending on their lifestyle and which genes they inherit. It is possible to identify the risk factors that may contribute to the cause of a disease. You can look at people who have the same factors (e.g. smoking) and compare their risk of the disease with the average risk for the whole population. Using these techniques, it appears that there are a number of factors that increase the likelihood that a person will develop atherosclerosis. If many factors influence your chance of having a disease, it is called a multifactorial disease. The study of the patterns of diseases and their causes is called epidemiology. When two different sets of data change together, there may be a link, which is called a correlation. For example, mortality data from a disease such as atherosclerosis may change in a similar pattern to a lifestyle factor such as smoking or lack of exercise. However, this does not prove that one is the cause of the other. They could both be caused by something else which would explain why they change in the same way. Correlation is not the same as causation \u2013 further research is always needed to demonstrate a causal link. For example, fig B shows the percentage of deaths in the UAE from cardiovascular disease each year. It also shows the statistics for obesity and diabetes. This data suggests a possible correlation between obesity and heart disease. \nDeaths from CVD 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 \nObese Percentage of the population affected \nOverweight Diabetes 33% 47.5% \n13% 31% \n\u25b2 fig B This data shows a possible correlation between obesity, diabetes and death from cardiovascular disease (CVD).

You cannot base conclusions on a single set of data. However, these UAE data agree with findings from countries around the world that suggest obesity is closely linked to the development of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Dr Raghib Ali, principle investigator in the UAE Healthy Future Study, has set up a long-term study in Abu Dhabi.

You owe it to them to make sure you can remember all of the stuff about them on these pages. It'll help you and your membranes get a good grade.\n\n@@@Triglycerides: A Type of Lipid\nTriglycerides are a kind of lipid. They have one molecule of glycerol with three fatty acids attached to it. Structure of a Triglyceride Fatty acid molecules have long tails made of hydrocarbons. The tails are 'hydrophobic' (they repel water molecules). These tails make lipids insoluble in water. All fatty acids have the same basic structure, but the hydrocarbon tail varies. \n\n@@@Basic Structure and Formation of Fatty Acids\nFatty Acid\nThe basic structure of a fatty acid includes a carbon atom that links the fatty acid to glycerol, an 'R' group which is the variable hydrocarbon tail, and the hydrocarbon 'tail' of fatty acids.\n\n@@@Process of Triglyceride Formation\nTriglycerides are formed by condensation reactions. The diagram shows a fatty acid joining to a glycerol molecule. When the ester bond is formed, a molecule of water is released\u2014 it's a condensation reaction. This process happens twice more to form a triglyceride.\n\n@@@Characteristics of Fatty Acids: Saturated vs Unsaturated\nFatty acids can be saturated or unsaturated. There are two kinds of fatty acids \u2014 saturated and unsaturated. The difference is in their hydrocarbon tails (R group). Saturated fatty acids don't have any double bonds between their carbon atoms. Unsaturated fatty acids have at least one double bond between carbon atoms, which cause the chain to kink.\n\n@@@Phospholipids and Their Role in Cell Membranes\nPhospholipids are similar to triglycerides. The lipids found in cell membranes aren't triglycerides\u2014 they're phospholipids. Phospholipids are pretty similar to triglycerides except one of the fatty acid molecules is replaced by a phosphate group. The phosphate group is hydrophilic (attracts water), whereas the fatty acid tails are hydrophobic (repel water).

It is also an important storage carbohydrate in fungi. Chemically, glycogen is very similar to the amylopectin molecules in starch, and it also has many \u03b1-glucose units. Like starch, it is very compact, but the glycogen molecule has more 1,6-glycosidic bonds than the starch molecule, giving it many side branches. This means that glycogen can be broken down very rapidly. This makes it an ideal source of glucose for animals which may require rapid release of energy at certain times of high activity levels (see fig E). In (a) you can see liver cells full of small glycogen granules, stained pink in this micrograph. If your blood glucose levels are low, this glycogen store in your liver can be broken down to provide the glucose you need for cellular respiration.

This means that there are always equal amounts of adenine and thymine in a DNA molecule and equal amounts of cytosine and guanine. Two hydrogen bonds form between A and T, and three hydrogen bonds form between C and G. The two antiparallel (running in opposite directions) polynucleotide strands twist to form the DNA double-helix. DNA was first observed in the 1800s, but lots of scientists at the time doubted that it could carry the genetic code because it has a relatively simple chemical composition. Some argued that genetic information must be carried by proteins\u2014which are much more chemically varied. By 1953, experiments had shown that DNA was the carrier of the genetic code. This was also the year in which the double-helix structure, which helps DNA to carry out its function, was determined by Watson and Crick.\n\n@@@RNA: The Single Polynucleotide Chain\nRNA is a relatively short polynucleotide chain. It is made from a single polynucleotide chain (not a double one). It's much shorter than most DNA polynucleotides.\n\n@@@Practice and Exam Questions on DNA and RNA\nPractice Questions Q1: Name the bases in RNA.\nExam Questions Q1-Q2: If Q1=40 and Q2=30, there is a graphical representation showing the percentage of the bases in a DNA sample that is adenine and cytosine.

Make sure you know the differences between RNA and DNA too \u2014 interesting stuff. \n\n@@@Additional Notes on DNA Double-Helix Structure\nThe two strands are antiparallel (they run in opposite directions).

For example, a scientist was investigating linkage between the genes for eye color and wing length in fruit flies. The gene for normal wings (N) is dominant to the gene for vestigial wings (n), and the gene for red eyes (R) is dominant to the gene for purple eyes (r). The first cross the scientist carried out was between flies homozygous dominant for both normal wings and red eyes (NNRR) and flies homozygous recessive for both vestigial wings and purple eyes (nnrr). The resulting offspring were all heterozygous for normal wings and red eyes (NnRr). The second cross the scientist carried out was between these offspring (NnRr) and the flies homozygous recessive for vestigial wings and purple eyes (nnrr). He expected a 1:1:1:1 ratio as shown below, which is known as a backcross (crossing the offspring with one of the parents). However, the results he got for this cross showed a disproportionate 8:1:1:8 ratio instead. This indicated that the NR alleles and the nr alleles in the NnRr parent must have been linked, meaning that the parent produced primarily NR and nr gametes. Some Nr and nR gametes were still made due to crossing over, but there were fewer Nnrr and nnRr offspring overall. As a result, a higher proportion of the offspring have the phenotypes of their parents.\n\n@@@An Epistatic Gene Masks the Expression of Another Gene\n\nDifferent genes may interact to determine a single characteristic, a phenomenon where the allele of one gene can mask or block the expression of alleles of other genes, which is referred to as epistasis. For example, in humans, a widow's peak hairline is determined by one gene, while baldness is influenced by another. If a person has alleles for baldness, the presence of the allele for a widow's peak is irrelevant since there is no hair to display this trait. In this case, the baldness gene is epistatic to the gene determining a widow's peak. In another instance, flower pigmentation in a plant is affected by two genes: one gene codes for a yellow pigment while another gene produces an enzyme that changes the yellow pigment to orange. If the dominant yellow pigment allele is absent, even possessing the allele for the orange pigment enzyme won't result in coloration\u2014a clear example of one gene being epistatic to another. Importantly, crosses that involve epistatic genes often do not conform to the expected phenotypic ratios that would normally result from a dihybrid cross, as illustrated by crossing two heterozygous orange flowered plants (YyRr) in the flower pigment example. \n\nTopic 7A of this course deals with Genetics.","167":"@@@Evaluation of Environmental and Social Audits\nEnvironmental and social audits are tools used to assess a company's performance in these two critical areas. Though they hold significant potential for demonstrating responsibility, they currently face skepticism due to their voluntary nature, lack of standardization, and the absence of a validation process, leading some observers to doubt their validity. Accusations have been made against companies for using audits as a publicity stunt or a smokescreen to conceal their actual, potentially harmful operations. In addition to these concerns, the costs associated with conducting and publishing these audits can be prohibitively high, especially for small businesses or those with very limited financial resources.\n\n@@@Environmental and Ethical Issues \u2013 The Role of Pressure Groups\nBusinesses are increasingly realizing the importance of incorporating environmental and ethical concerns into their decision-making, influenced significantly by the rise of pressure groups at national and international levels. These organizations, which include well-known entities like Greenpeace, the Fairtrade Foundation, WWF, Amnesty International, and Jubilee 2000, exert pressure on businesses and governments to change policies and enact laws in support of their objectives. Their successful operations hinge on triggering changes in government policies, business practices, and consumer behavior, leading to an environment where ethical and sustainable operations are rewarded.\n\n@@@Methods of Pressure Group Influence\nPressure groups operate through a variety of strategies with the aim of effecting changes across three main fronts: lobbying governments to establish supportive legislation, urging businesses to adopt environmentally and ethically sound policies, and influencing consumer purchasing habits to favor businesses that align with their objectives. They utilize widespread media coverage and public relations to keep their campaigns visible and pertinent, often creating damaging publicity for targeted companies to incite policy revisions. Additionally, by influencing consumer behavior, they can instigate commercial pressures that compel companies to amend their business models, as seen in the boycott against Shell that led them to reassess their environmental strategies. Furthermore, pressure groups engage in direct lobbying efforts with government officials to push for legal changes that support their causes.","168":"@@@Introduction to Enzyme Activity Influences\nNow you know what enzymes are and how they work, let's take a look at what makes them tick. Humans need things like money and the newest mobile phone, but enzymes are quite content with the right temperature and pH.\n\n@@@Temperature's Impact on Enzymes\nTemperature has a big influence on enzyme activity. Like any chemical reaction, the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction increases when the temperature's increased. More heat means more kinetic energy, so molecules move faster. This makes the enzymes more likely to collide with the substrate molecules. The energy of these collisions also increases, which means each collision is more likely to result in a reaction. But, if the temperature gets too high, the reaction stops. 1) The rise in temperature makes the enzyme's molecules vibrate more. 2) If the temperature goes above a certain level, this vibration breaks some of the bonds that hold the enzyme in shape. 3) The active site changes shape and the enzyme and substrate no longer fit together. 4) At this point, the enzyme is denatured\u2014it no longer functions as a catalyst. Optimum temperature for most human enzymes is around 37\u00b0C but some enzymes, like those used in biological washing powders, can work well at 60 \u00b0C.\n\n@@@The Role of pH in Enzyme Function\npH also affects enzyme activity. Every enzyme has an optimum pH value. Most human enzymes work best at pH 7 (neutral), but there are exceptions. Pepsin, for example, works best at acidic pH 2, which is useful because it's found in the stomach. Above and below the optimum pH, the H+ and OH- ions found in acids and alkalis can mess up the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds that hold the enzyme's tertiary structure in place. This makes the active site change shape, so the enzyme is denatured.\n\n@@@Enzyme Concentration and Reaction Rates\nEnzyme concentration affects the rate of reaction. 1) The more enzyme molecules there are in a solution, the more likely a substrate molecule is to collide with one and form an enzyme-substrate complex. So increasing the concentration of the enzyme increases the rate of reaction. 2) But, if the amount of substrate is limited, there comes a point when there's more than enough enzyme molecules to deal with all the available substrate, so adding more enzyme has no further effect.\n\n@@@Substrate Concentration's Effect on Reaction Rate\nSubstrate concentration affects the rate of reaction up to a point. 1) The higher the substrate concentration, the faster the reaction \u2014 more substrate molecules means a collision between substrate and enzyme is more likely and so more active sites will be used. This is only true up until a 'saturation' point though. After that, there are so many substrate molecules that the enzymes have about as much as they can cope with (all the active sites are full), and adding more makes no difference. 2) Substrate concentration decreases with time during a reaction (unless more substrate is added to the reaction mixture), so if no other variables are changed, the rate of reaction will decrease over time too. This makes the initial rate of reaction (the reaction rate at the start) the highest rate of reaction.\n\n@@@Closing Overview\nTopic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules","169":"@@@Topic 4B \u2014 Diversity, Classification and Variation: Introduction to Meiosis and Genetic Variation\nThe discussion in Topic 4B revolves around the exciting processes that lead to genetic uniqueness in individuals, including the creation of gametes or sex cells. Gametes are crucial in allowing genetic differences from our parents and siblings while maintaining certain similarities. The focus is on the transition of DNA from one generation to the next through these sex cells, which include sperms in males and eggs in females. The discourse touches on important concepts like haploid and diploid chromosome numbers, emphasizing how sexual reproduction results in a mixture of genetic material that increases genetic diversity within a species. This diversity is essential for the uniqueness within populations and plays a key role in the survival and evolution of species.\n\n@@@Meiosis: The Process of Gamete Formation and Chromosome Halving\nMeiosis is introduced as a special form of cell division essential for sexual reproduction, occurring within the reproductive organs. This section outlines the meiosis process, which starts with diploid cells that, through two stages of division, become haploid gametes, ensuring the maintenance of chromosomal integrity across generations. The explanation is detailed, describing the various phases of meiosis, including DNA replication, chromatid formation, and the separation of homologous chromosomes and sister chromatids, resulting in four genetically diverse haploid gametes. There's also the implication that understanding meiosis is practical for exams in various contexts, including potentially unfamiliar life cycles of insects or plants. The need for sexual reproduction to involve meiosis, which produces gametes with half the chromosome number of the parent cell, is reinforced.\n\n@@@Understanding Homologous Pairs and Genetic Inheritance\nIn this explanatory note about homologous pairs, there is an introduction to human chromosomal details, with humans having 46 chromosomes, or 23 pairs, delineating parental origins and the concept of homologous chromosomes. It is mentioned that each chromosome pair consists of one chromosome from each parent, and while chromosomes in a pair are structurally similar and carry the same genes, the versions of these genes, called alleles, may differ. Such pairs are known as homologous pairs, and this concept is crucial for comprehending how traits and genetic material are inherited and recombined to produce genetic diversity.","170":"@@@Genetic Diversity and Natural Selection\n\nGenetic diversity describes the number of alleles in a species or population, and natural selection acts to increase the proportion of advantageous alleles. It's all about the most well-adapted organisms getting on with some reproduction. Lots of Different Alleles Means a High Genetic Diversity1) Remember, there can be different versions of a single gene \u2014 these are called alleles (see page 83).2) Genetic diversity is the number of different alleles of genes in a species or population. 3) Genetic diversity within a population is increased by: \n- Mutations in the DNA \u2014 forming new alleles.\n- Different alleles being introduced into a population when individuals from another population migrate into them and reproduce. This is known as gene flow.\n4) Genetic diversity is what allows natural selection to occur (see next page).\n\n@@@Genetic Bottlenecks Reduce Genetic Diversity\n\n1) A genetic bottleneck is an event that causes a big reduction in a population, e.g., when a large number of organisms within a population die before reproducing. 2) This reduces the number of different alleles in the gene pool and so reduces genetic diversity.\n3) The survivors reproduce and a larger population is created from a few individuals. Example \u2014 Northern Elephant Seals: Northern elephant seals were hunted by humans in the late 1800s. Their original population was reduced to around 50 seals who have since produced a population of around 170,000. This new population has very little genetic diversity compared to the southern elephant seals who never suffered such a reduction in numbers.\n\n@@@The Founder Effect is a Type of Genetic Bottleneck\n\n1) The founder effect describes what happens when just a few organisms from a population start a new colony and there are only a small number of different alleles in the initial gene pool.\n2) The frequency of each allele in the new colony might be very different from the frequency of those alleles in the original population \u2014 for example, an allele that was rare in the original population might be more common in the new colony. This may lead to a higher incidence of genetic diseases.\n3) The founder effect can occur as a result of migration leading to geographical separation or if a new colony is separated from the original population for another reason, such as religion. Example \u2014 The Amish: The Amish population of North America are all descended from a small number of Swiss who migrated there. The population shows little genetic diversity. They have remained isolated from the surrounding population due to their religious beliefs, so few new alleles have been introduced. The population has an unusually high incidence of certain genetic disorders.\n\n@@@Topic 4B \u2014 Diversity, Classification and Variation\n\nThis part of the text appears to be more of a header or title for a section that may be following on from the previous topics discussed. It suggests that the subsequent content will focus on diversity, classification, and variation in a biological context. However, no further information is provided within the given text to expand upon this title.","171":"@@@Introduction to Cell Division and Mitosis\n\nCell division is essential for growth and repair in multicellular organisms. Without cell division, we would remain the size of a single cell. With a touch of humor, the importance of cell division is likened to the role pies have in preventing a favorite pair of jeans from fitting.\n\n@@@Overview of Mitosis as a Form of Cell Division\n\nMitosis is one type of cell division in eukaryotes, distinct from meiosis, which is covered in another section. The purpose of mitosis is to divide a parent cell into two genetically identical daughter cells, each containing an exact copy of the parent cell's DNA. This process is critical for the growth of multicellular organisms and the repair of damaged tissues. In multicellular organisms, not all cells retain the ability to divide; those that do follow an ordered series of stages known as the cell cycle, of which mitosis is a part.\n\n@@@Details of the Cell Cycle\n\nThe cell cycle is made up of an interphase, where the cell grows and replicates its DNA, and mitosis, where actual division happens. Interphase itself is broken down into three stages: G1 (gap phase 1), where the cell grows and creates new organelles and proteins; S (synthesis), where the cell replicates its DNA; and G2 (gap phase 2), where further growth occurs and proteins needed for cell division are synthesized.\n\n@@@Stages of Mitosis\n\nMitosis consists of four stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, preceded by interphase. Interphase involves the cell carrying out normal functions, doubling its genetic content, replicating organelles, and increasing its ATP content in preparation for division. Prophase sees chromosomes condensing, centrioles moving to opposite ends of the cell establishing the spindle, and the nuclear envelope disintegrating. Significantly, chromosomes are observed as two chromatids joined at a centromere.\n\nMetaphase is characterized by chromosomes lining up at the cell's equator and attaching to the spindle fibers by their centromere. Anaphase follows with the splitting of centromeres, leading to sister chromatids being pulled to opposite cell poles, thus taking a V-shape. Finally, in telophase, chromatids reach the spindle poles and uncoil into chromosomes once more, nuclear envelopes reform around them, and cytokinesis splits the cytoplasm, culminating in two daughter cells that enter interphase to prepare for their own mitotic events.\n\n@@@Cell Structure and Division Section Overview\n\nThe text belongs to Topic 2A, which delves into the specifics of cell structure and division. The detailed discussion on mitosis within this section encapsulates the intricacies of this vital cellular process.","172":"@@@Introduction to Cell Biology and Microscopy Techniques\n1 Cell biology begins with understanding the structure of cells and the tools used to study them. Microscopes play a crucial role in cell biology by allowing scientists to visualize cells and their components.\n\n@@@Transmission Electron Microscopes (TEM)\n18Transmission electron microscopes fire a large beam of electrons through a very thin slice of the specimen. All electrons are fired at the same time. Not all of the electrons pass though the specimen. The image is made from only those electrons that do. Transmission electron microscopes are capable of producing flat, typically cross-sectional images of specimens, such as a section through a cell, which can reveal detailed internal structures. However, these resulting images are inherently black and white, though they can be colorized for enhanced visualization.\n\n@@@Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM)\nScanning electron microscopes also use a beam of electrons. This beam is much smaller and scans across the whole image but not all at the same time. Electrons scatter from the surface of the sample and are detected to make an image. Unlike TEM, scanning electron microscopes are adept at creating images that appear more three-dimensional since they do not require thin samples. The images captured by SEMs provide a different perspective on the specimen's surface topography, complementing the internal details that TEMs reveal.\n\n@@@Resolution and Magnification in Microscopy\nThe resolution of microscopes is defined as the shortest distance between two parts of a specimen that can be seen as two distinctly separate points. Due to the limitations imposed by the wavelength of light, the maximum resolution of light microscopes is 200 nanometers (nm), where one nm is one-millionth of a millimeter. Electron microscopes, on the other hand, have a much shorter wavelength of electrons, allowing them to resolve points up to 2000 times closer than light microscopes, at a separation of just 0.1 nm. This advanced resolution contributes significantly to the greater magnification capabilities of electron microscopes, setting them apart from their light-based counterparts.\n\n@@@Key Term Definition\nResolution is the smallest distance between two separate points that can be distinguished by an imaging device, and it is a fundamental term in the field of microscopy.\n\n@@@Self-Assessment and Practical Application\nTest yourself by addressing questions about the capabilities and limitations of light and electron microscopes:\n13. State the range of magnification you might see in a light microscope.\n14. State the resolution of an electron microscope.\n15. Describe why electron microscopes have greater magnification.\n16. Describe a disadvantage of using an electron microscope.\nDemonstrate your knowledge of microscopy by explaining why scanning electron microscopes can take images that look three-dimensional.\n\n@@@Visual Comparison of Microscopy Techniques\n\u25b2 Figure 1.20 exemplifies the different imaging capabilities of scanning and transmission electron microscopes. Panel (a) shows a three-dimensional image of an ant\u2019s head taken with a scanning electron microscope, while panel (b) presents a two-dimensional image of a mitochondrion captured using a transmission electron microscope. These images illustrate the diverse applications of electron microscopy in visualizing both surface structure and internal cellular detail."}}
