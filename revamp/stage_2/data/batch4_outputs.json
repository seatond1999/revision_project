It is important that safety glasses are worn to reduce the risk of eye damage when the band breaks. It is best to use a short, thin rubber band, as it will stretch to several times its original length and thick bands are difficult to break. To alter the length of the band, the boss is loosened and moved up the stand. The force at each extension is read off the newton-meter.\n\nThe rubber band stretches very easily at first, reaching a length of three or four times its original value (Figure 13.8). It then becomes very stiff and difficult to stretch as it approaches its breaking point.\n\nFigure 13.7 depicts the process of stretching a rubber band. The ruler and newton-meter are used to measure the length and force respectively. The rubber band is attached to the boss on the stand, which can be moved up to increase the length of the band.\n\nFigure 13.8 displays the resulting force\u2013extension curve for a rubber band. The x-axis represents the extension length in centimeters, and the y-axis represents the force in newtons. The curve shows the behavior of the rubber band under increasing tension, with the band becoming increasingly difficult to stretch as it approaches its breaking point.\n\nNatural rubber is a polymer. It contains long chains of atoms that are normally tangled in a disordered fashion, like strands of spaghetti. Relatively small forces are needed to \u2018untangle\u2019 these molecules, so a large extension is produced for small loads. When the chains are fully extended, additional forces are required to stretch the bonds between the atoms, so much smaller extensions are produced for a given load; the rubber becomes stiffer. It should be noted that the band returns to its original length if the force is removed at any stage prior to breaking \u2013 that is, the rubber band is elastic.\n\n@@@Compression Testing and Material Behavior\nUp to now, we have considered only the behavior of materials that have been subjected to stretching \u2013 or tensile forces. If weights were placed on top of a large rectangular sponge, the sponge would be noticeably squashed, and force\u2013compression readings could be easily measured. This is much more difficult for metals. Long, thin samples of copper wire can be extended by several centimeters with tensile forces of 50 N or less, but shorter, thicker samples needed for compression tests require much larger forces to produce measurable compressions.\n\nIn engineering laboratories, large hydraulic presses are used, but a school\u2019s compression testing kit, shown in Figure 13.9, can demonstrate the effects of compression on a range of sample materials. \n\nThe kit includes a flat base, a plunger with a circular grip, and a compression gauge. The sample material is placed on the base, and the plunger is pressed down to compress the sample, while the compression gauge measures the force required to compress the sample. This allows for the analysis of the material's behavior under compressive forces.\n\n807527_C13_Edexcel_Physics_188-209.indd 196 24\/02\/2015 14:20 ","1":"\nOutput:  @@@Nature of Waves and Phase\nThe text discusses the concept of waves, specifically focusing on the phase of oscillations. A mass on a spring is used as an example, and the positions of the mass after successive intervals of one quarter of a period are shown in Figure 14.9. The term 'phase' is introduced to describe the position within a cycle that a particle occupies relative to the onset of the cycle. The oscillations are described as being in antiphase when they are half a cycle out of step, and this is further illustrated by the example of masses 1 and 5 always being in phase, mass 3 being in antiphase with both 1 and 5, and masses 2 and 4 being one quarter and three quarters of a cycle out of phase with mass 1. The phase differences between oscillations are quantified in terms of radians, with oscillations in antiphase having a phase difference of \u03c0 radians (180\u00b0), those differing by one quarter and three quarters of a cycle being \u03c0\/2 radians (90\u00b0) and 3\u03c0\/2 radians (270\u00b0) out of phase, respectively. The displacement\u2013distance graphs of oscillations are also discussed, with a snapshot of a water wave representing a wave profile showing the positions of particles along the surface at a given time. This profile can be represented on a displacement\u2013distance graph, as shown in Figure 14.11.\n\n@@@Displacement-Distance Graphs and the Representation of Phase Relationships\nThe text continues by discussing the concept of displacement\u2013distance graphs, using the example of a water wave traveling along the surface of a glass-sided aquarium. The snapshot of the edge of the wave, as viewed through the glass, represents the wave profile, showing the shape of the surface at that instant. This profile can be represented on a displacement\u2013distance graph, with the x-axis representing displacement\/distance, the y-axis representing mass, and the wavelength indicated by the period between successive peaks. The phase relationships of masses 1\u20135 are shown in Figure 14.10, and the text provides a visual representation of these relationships on the displacement\u2013distance graphs. ","2":"\nOutput:  @@@Introduction to Electromagnetic Waves\nElectric and magnetic fields will be studied in some detail in the Year 2  Student\u2019s book, but you should be aware that the fields do not require a  material medium and that varying electric fields cannot exist without  associated magnetic fields and vice versa. Electromagnetic waves can be  detected when they pass over charged particles. Some of their energy is  transferred to the particles, which makes them vibrate at the frequency of  the wave.\nElectromagnetic waves can also occur as a result of \u2018quantum jumps\u2019 of  electrons in atoms or from \u2018excited\u2019 nuclei. The waves produced in this  manner are emitted as photons , which are \u2018bundles\u2019 of waves of a few  nanoseconds duration that have wavelengths dependent on their energy. The  photon nature of light will be investigated in Chapter 17.\n\n@@@Overview of Electromagnetic Waves and Their Properties\nThe complete range of electromagnetic waves and some of their properties  are given in Table 14.1. You will have come across this material during your GCSE studies, so this is a useful reminder!\n\n@@@Electromagnetic Waves and Their Origin\nMechanical waves are initiated by vibrating objects passing on some of their  energy to the atoms or molecules of a material medium. Electromagnetic  waves are created when charged particles are accelerated.\n\n@@@Understanding Radio Waves\nRadio waves are an example of electromagnetic radiation. Electrons in an aerial  are made to oscillate using electronic circuitry, and this produces a wave of  continuously varying electric and magnetic fields with the same frequency as the  oscillator. The electric field variations are in the plane of the antenna, with the  magnetic field in a plane at right angles to it, as shown in Figure 14.14.

A phase change of \u03c0 radians (180 \u00b0) takes place at the point of reflection, which means that destructive interference will occur, and the fixed position will (not surprisingly) be a node. Standing waves in a string can be investigated using Melde\u2019s experiment. A thin length of string is attached to an oscillator, passed over a pulley wheel and kept taut by a weight hanging from its end. The frequency of the oscillator is adjusted until nodes and antinodes are clearly visible. A strobe lamp can be used to \u2018slow down\u2019 the motion so that the standing wave can be studied in more detail. The wavelength of the wave is found by measuring the distance between alternate nodes. Standing waves of shorter or longer wavelength are observed if the frequency of the oscillator is increased or decreased or the weight on the string is altered. The speed of the incident and reflected waves in the string can be calculated using v = f \u03bb. An investigation into how this depends on the tension or thickness of the string can be performed.\n\n@@@Stringed Instruments and Sound Production\nStringed instruments such as guitars, violins, and pianos all produce standing waves on strings stretched between two points. When plucked, bowed, or struck, the energy in the standing wave is transferred to the air around it and generates a sound. Because the string interacts with only a small region of air, the sound needs to be amplified \u2013 either by a resonating sound box or electronically. The principle of stringed instruments can be demonstrated using a sonometer. When the string is plucked at its midpoint, the waves reflected from each end will interfere to set up a standing wave in the string. As both ends are fixed, they must be nodes, so the simplest standing wave will have one antinode between two nodes \u2013 that is, the length of the string will be half a wavelength. Using the expression v = T\u03bc and the wave equation, v = f \u03bb, the frequency of the note emitted by the wire in this mode will be f = v\u03bb = 12lT\u03bc. It is important to note that frequencies in the range of 5-30 Hz should be avoided as they may trigger epileptic fits in some individuals.\n\n@@@Safety Considerations in Experimentation\nSafety note: Frequencies in the range of 5-30 Hz should be avoided as they may trigger epileptic fits in some individuals. ","4":"\nOutput:  @@@Introduction to Diffraction\nWhen a wave passes through a gap or is partially obstructed by a barrier, the wavefront spreads out into the \u2018shadow\u2019 region (Figure 16.20a). This effect is called diffraction and is easily demonstrated using a ripple tank. The dark and light lines represent crests and troughs on the surface of the water, and can therefore be considered as wavefronts.\n\n@@@Effect of Frequency and Aperture Width on Diffraction\nIf the oscillator in a ripple tank is adjusted to a higher frequency, the wavelength shortens and the spreading is reduced. Narrowing the aperture of the gap between two barriers causes even more spreading of the wave (Figure 16.20b). When the width is similar to the wavelength, the wavefronts are almost circular.\n\n@@@Explanation of Diffraction Using Huygens\u2019 Construction\nDiffraction can be explained using Huygens\u2019 construction (shown in Figure 16.21). Huygens considered every point on a wavefront as the source of secondary spherical wavelets which spread out with the wave velocity. The new wavefront is the envelope of these secondary wavelets.\n\n@@@Behavior of Diffracted Wavefronts Around Obstacles\nWhen a wavefront is obstructed by a slit or an obstacle, the secondary wavelets at the edges are transmitted into the geometrical shadow causing diffraction spreading. In some instances patterns can be seen due to the interference of imagined point sources on the wavefront as it passes through the slit or around the obstruction.\n\n@@@Visualization of Diffraction of Wavefronts\nFigures 16.22 (a) and (c) show how the secondary wavelets at S1 and S2 spill over into the geometrical shadow. Figure 16.22 (b) illustrates how the wavefront in a very narrow aperture behaves as a single source of a secondary wavelet.\n\n@@@Comparison of Diffraction to Other Wave Phenomena\nShort-wave radio and television signals do not diffract significantly into valleys or around the curvature of the Earth\u2019s surface, but military communications radio sends out signals with wavelengths of several kilometres that can be detected by submarines almost halfway around the world.\n\n@@@Investigating Diffraction Patterns Using Microwaves\nClose inspection of the water waves on the ripple tank emerging from the narrow aperture in Figure 16.20b reveals regions of constructive and destructive superposition at the edges of the circular wavefront. This effect can be further investigated using a microwave kit (Figure 16.23). The transmitter is placed about 20 cm from a pair of aluminium sheets and directed at a gap of about 5 cm. The receiver is placed facing the aperture and about 50 cm away from the other side of the sheets. The output from the receiver is measured at the midpoint and at 10 \u00b0 intervals as it is moved along a semi-circular path.\n\n@@@Characteristics of Diffraction Patterns\nThe diffraction pattern shows a central maximum edged by a series of lower intensity maxima and minima as opposed to the regular pattern of interference from a double slit. The central maximum will broaden when the slit width is reduced.\n\n@@@Relationship Between Wavelength and Slit Width in Diffraction\nIt can be shown that, for a slit of width a, the angle \u03b8 between the central maximum and the first minimum is given by the equation: sin \u03b8 = \u03bb\/a. In general, to create a diffraction pattern using a slit, the wavelength should be of the same order of magnitude as the width of the slit. Patterns can be seen for slightly wider slits but the value of \u03b8 becomes smaller. For angles of less than about 10 \u00b0, the approximation sin \u03b8 = tan \u03b8 = \u03b8 radians can be used.
