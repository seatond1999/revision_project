Safety note: It is important that safety glasses are worn to reduce the risk of eye damage when the band breaks. It is best to use a short, thin rubber band, as it will stretch to several times its original length and thick bands are difficult to break. To alter the length of the band, the boss is loosened and moved up the stand. The force at each extension is read off the newton-meter.\n\nThe rubber band stretches very easily at first, reaching a length of three or four times its original value (Figure 13.8). It then becomes very stiff and difficult to stretch as it approaches its breaking point. Figure 13.7 illustrates the process of stretching a rubber band, with the newton-meter used to measure force and the rubber band itself the subject of the experiment. This figure also highlights the importance of safety measures, such as wearing safety glasses, to prevent potential injury.\n\nRubber bands are comprised of natural rubber, a polymer, which consists of long chains of atoms that are usually tangled in a disordered fashion, much like strands of spaghetti. These molecules can be untangled with relatively small forces, resulting in large extensions for small loads. When these chains are fully extended, additional forces are needed to stretch the bonds between the atoms, making it more difficult to extend the rubber further. It is important to note that the band returns to its original length if the force is removed at any stage prior to breaking \u2013 that is, the rubber band is elastic.\n\n@@@Force\u2013Compression Graphs in Solid Materials\nUp to now we have considered only the behavior of materials that have been subjected to stretching \u2013 or tensile forces. If weights were placed on top of a large rectangular sponge, the sponge would be noticeably squashed and force\u2013compression readings could be easily measured. This is much more difficult for metals. While long, thin samples of copper wire can be extended by several centimeters with tensile forces of 50 N or less, shorter, thicker samples needed for compression tests require much larger forces to produce measurable compressions.\n\nIn engineering laboratories, large hydraulic presses are used, but a school\u2019s compression testing kit, shown in Figure 13.9, can demonstrate the effects of compression on a range of sample materials. This figure provides an illustration of the equipment used in a school setting to study the behavior of solid materials under compression.","1":"\nOutput:  @@@Nature of Waves and the Concept of Phase\nFigure 14.9 shows a mass on a spring undergoing one complete oscillation, and the positions of the mass after successive intervals of one quarter of a period. Halfway through the cycle, the mass is moving through the midpoint in the opposite direction to the starting position. The oscillations at these points are out of step with each other or \u2018out of phase\u2019. Any two oscillations that are half a cycle out of step are said to be in antiphase. At the end of the cycle, the mass is moving through the midpoint in the same direction as at the start, and the vibrations are now back in phase.\n\nThe key term 'The phase of an oscillation refers to the position within a cycle that the particle occupies relative to the onset of the cycle.'\n\nFor example, if you consider the oscillations in Figure 14.9 to be five separate masses, you will note that masses 1 and 5 are always in phase, mass 3 is in antiphase with both 1 and 5, and masses 2 and 4 are one quarter of a cycle and three quarters of a cycle out of phase with mass 1. For a sinusoidal waveform, one cycle represents 2\u03c0 radians (360\u00b0), so oscillations that are in antiphase are said to have a phase difference of \u03c0 radians (180\u00b0), while those that differ by one quarter and three quarters of a cycle are \u03c02 radians (90\u00b0) and 3\u03c02 radians (270\u00b0) out of phase, respectively.\n\nThese phase relationships of masses 1\u20135 are represented on the displacement\u2013time graphs in Figure 14.10.\n\n@@@Understanding Displacement\u2013Distance Graphs\nImagine a water wave traveling along the surface of a glass-sided aquarium. A snapshot of the edge of the wave viewed through the glass would reveal a wave profile showing the shape of the surface at that instant. This profile shows the positions of the particles along the surface at that time and can be represented on a displacement\u2013distance graph, as shown in Figure 14.11.\n\nDisplacement\/m\nDistance\/m\nwavelength\nk\nwavelength\nk\n\nThe graph is labeled with the units of displacement and distance, and the wavelength is indicated.\n\n807527_C14_Edexcel_Physics_210-220.indd 214 24\/02\/2015 14:21  ### ","2":"\nOutput:  @@@Introduction to Electromagnetic Waves\nElectric and magnetic fields will be studied in some detail in the Year 2 Student\u2019s book, but you should be aware that the fields do not require a material medium and that varying electric fields cannot exist without associated magnetic fields and vice versa. Electromagnetic waves can be detected when they pass over charged particles. Some of their energy is transferred to the particles, which makes them vibrate at the frequency of the wave.\n\n@@@Properties of Electromagnetic Waves\nElectromagnetic waves can also occur as a result of \u2018quantum jumps\u2019 of electrons in atoms or from \u2018excited\u2019 nuclei. The waves produced in this manner are emitted as photons , which are \u2018bundles\u2019 of waves of a few nanoseconds duration that have wavelengths dependent on their energy. The photon nature of light will be investigated in Chapter 17.\n\n@@@Overview of Electromagnetic Waves and Their Properties\nThe complete range of electromagnetic waves and some of their properties are given in Table 14.1. You will have come across this material during your GCSE studies, so this is a useful reminder!\n\n@@@Mechanics of Electromagnetic Waves\nMechanical waves are initiated by vibrating objects passing on some of their energy to the atoms or molecules of a material medium. Electromagnetic waves are created when charged particles are accelerated. Radio waves are an example of electromagnetic radiation. Electrons in an aerial are made to oscillate using electronic circuitry, and this produces a wave of continuously varying electric and magnetic fields with the same frequency as the oscillator. The electric field variations are in the plane of the antenna, with the magnetic field in a plane at right angles to it, as shown in Figure 14.14.\n\nB E\nDistanc e\nmagnetic field oscillation\n(vertical)electric field oscillation\n(horizontal)\nFigure 14.14 Electromagnetic wave.\n\n@@@Conclusion\n807527_C14_Edexcel_Physics_210-220.indd   216 24\/02\/2015   14:21 \n\nThis text is a part of a larger document, and the last paragraph seems to be an unrelated piece of text related to the formatting or publishing process.

A phase change of \u03c0 radians (180\u00b0) takes place at the point of reflection (Figure 16.12). This means that destructive interference will occur and the fixed position will (not surprisingly) be a node.\n\n@@@Investigating Standing Waves with Melde's Experiment\nStanding waves in a string can be investigated using Melde\u2019s experiment (Figure 16.13). A thin length of string is attached to an oscillator, passed over a pulley wheel and kept taut by a weight hanging from its end. The frequency of the oscillator is adjusted until nodes and antinodes are clearly visible. A strobe lamp can be used to \u2018slow down\u2019 the motion so that the standing wave can be studied in more detail. The wavelength of the wave is found by measuring the distance between alternate nodes. Standing waves of shorter or longer wavelength are observed if the frequency of the oscillator is increased or decreased or the weight on the string is altered. The speed of the incident and reflected waves in the string can be calculated using v = f\u03bb. An investigation into how this depends on the tension or thickness of the string can be performed.\n\n@@@Applications of Stringed Instruments and the Principle of Sonometer\nStringed instruments such as guitars, violins and pianos all produce standing waves on strings stretched between two points. When plucked, bowed or struck, the energy in the standing wave is transferred to the air around it and generates a sound. Because the string interacts with only a small region of air, the sound needs to be amplified\u2014either by a resonating sound box or electronically. The principle of stringed instruments can be demonstrated using a sonometer (Figure 16.14). When the string is plucked at its midpoint, the waves reflected from each end will interfere to set up a standing wave in the string. As both ends are fixed, they must be nodes, so the simplest standing wave will have one antinode between two nodes\u2014that is, the length of the string will be half a wavelength. Using the expression v = T\u03bc and the wave equation, v = f\u03bb, the frequency of the note emitted by the wire in this mode will be f = v\u03bb\/l.\n\nSafety note: Frequencies in the range 5 \u201330 Hz should be avoided as they may trigger epileptic fits in some individuals.\n\n@@@Summary\nIn summary, standing waves in strings are a result of the interference of waves reflected at the ends of the string. The study of these waves is essential in understanding the behavior of stringed instruments, which all rely on this principle. Experiments such as Melde\u2019s can be used to investigate standing waves and determine their properties.","4":"\nOutput:  @@@Diffraction and Huygens' Construction\nWhen a wave passes through a gap or is partially obstructed by a barrier, the wavefront spreads out into the \u2018shadow\u2019 region. This effect is called diffraction and is easily demonstrated using a ripple tank. The dark and light lines represent crests and troughs on the surface of the water, and can therefore be considered as wavefronts. If the oscillator in a ripple tank is adjusted to a higher frequency, the wavelength shortens and the spreading is reduced. Narrowing the aperture of the gap between two barriers causes even more spreading of the wave. When the width is similar to the wavelength, the wavefronts are almost circular. Diffraction can be explained using Huygens\u2019 construction. Huygens considered every point on a wavefront as the source of secondary spherical wavelets which spread out with the wave velocity. The new wavefront is the envelope of these secondary wavelets. When a wavefront is obstructed by a slit or an obstacle, the secondary wavelets at the edges are transmitted into the geometrical shadow causing diffraction spreading. In some instances, patterns can be seen due to the interference of imagined point sources on the wavefront as it passes through the slit or around the obstruction. Figures 16.22 (a) and (c) show how the secondary wavelets at S1 and S2 spill over into the geometrical shadow. Figure 16.22 (b) illustrates how the wavefront in a very narrow aperture behaves as a single source of a secondary wavelet.\n\n@@@Short-wave Radio and Television Signals\nShort-wave radio and television signals do not diffract significantly into valleys or around the curvature of the Earth\u2019s surface, but military communications radio sends out signals with wavelengths of several kilometres that can be detected by submarines almost halfway around the world.\n\n@@@Microwave Diffraction Patterns\nClose inspection of the water waves on the ripple tank emerging from a narrow aperture in Figure 16.20b reveals regions of constructive and destructive superposition at the edges of the circular wavefront. This effect can be further investigated using a microwave kit. The transmitter is placed about 20 cm from a pair of aluminium sheets and directed at a gap of about 5 cm. The receiver is placed facing the aperture and about 50 cm away from the other side of the sheets. The output from the receiver is measured at the midpoint and at 10 \u00b0 intervals as it is moved along a semi-circular path. The diffraction pattern shows a central maximum edged by a series of lower intensity maxima and minima as opposed to the regular pattern of interference from a double slit. The central maximum will broaden when the slit width is reduced. It can be shown that, for a slit of width, a, the angle \u03b8 between the central maximum and the first minimum is given by the equation: sin \u03b8 = \u03bb \/ a. In general, to create a diffraction pattern using a slit, the wavelength should be of the same order of magnitude as the width of the slit. Patterns can be seen for slightly wider slits but the value of \u03b8 becomes smaller. For angles of less than about 10 \u00b0, the approximation sin \u03b8 = tan \u03b8 = \u03b8 radians can be used. \n\n@@@Summary\nThis passage discusses the phenomena of diffraction, which occurs when a wave passes through a gap or is partially obstructed by a barrier. The spreading of the wavefront is explained using Huygens\u2019 construction, and examples are given of how diffraction can be observed using ripple tanks and microwave kits. The limitations of short-wave radio and television signals due to diffraction are also discussed. The mathematical relationship between the width of a slit and the angle of diffraction is explained, and the importance of the wavelength in creating a diffraction pattern is emphasized. "}}
