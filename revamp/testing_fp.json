But what are proteins? What do they look like? Well, for your enjoyment, here are the answers to all those questions and many, many more...Proteins are Made from Long Chains of Amino Acids1) The monomers of proteins are amino acids.2) A dipeptide is formed when two amino acids join together.3) A polypeptide is formed when more than two amino acids join together.4) Proteins are made up of one or more polypeptides.Grant's cries of \"die peptide, die\" could be heard for miles around.

They're much easier to explain if you describe their structure in four 'levels'. These levels are a protein's primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures.Primary Structure \u2014 this is the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain.Secondary Structure \u2014 the polypeptide chain doesn't remain flat and straight.Hydrogen bonds form between the amino acids in the chain.This makes it automatically coil into an alpha (a) helix or fold into a beta ((3) pleated sheet \u2014 this is the secondary structure.Tertiary Structure \u2014 the coiled or folded chain of amino acids is often coiled and folded further. More bonds form between different parts of the polypeptide chain, including hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds (attractions between negative and positive charges on different parts of the molecule).Disulfide bridges also form whenever two molecules of the amino acid cysteine come close together \u2014 the sulfur atom in one cysteine bonds to the sulfur atom in the other. For proteins made from a single polypeptide chain, the tertiary structure forms their final 3D structure.Quaternary Structure \u2014 some proteins are made of several different polypeptide chains held together by bonds. The quaternary structureis the way these polypeptide chains are assembled together. For proteins made from more than one polypeptide chain (e.g. haemoglobin, insulin, collagen), the quaternary structure is the protein's final 3D structure.amino acid\nTopic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","3":"10Enzyme ActionEnzymes crop up loads in biology \u2014 they're really useful 'cos they make reactions work quickly. So, whether you feel the need for some speed or not, read on \u2014 because you really need to know this basic stuff about enzymes.Enzymes are Biological CatalystsEnzymes speed up chemical reactions by acting as biological catalysts. A catalyst is a substance _1)2)3)4)5)6)- readior without being _r up in the reaction\"'t 11 n ' i\" 111\" 1Enzymes catalyse metabolic reactions \u2014 both at a cellular level (e.g. respiration) and for the organism as a whole (e.g. digestion in mammals).Enzymes can affect structures in an organism (e.g. enzymes are involved in the production of collagen, an important protein in the connective tissues of animals) as well as functions (like respiration).Enzyme action can be intracellular \u2014 within cells, or extracellular \u2014 outside cells.Enzymes are proteins (see previous page).Enzymes have an active site, which has a specific shape. The active site is the part of the enzyme where the substrate molecules (the substance that the enzyme interacts with) bind to.Enzymes are highly specific due to their tertiary structure (see next page).Enzymes Lower the Activation Energy of a ReactionIn a chemical reaction, a certain amount of energy needs to be supplied to the chemicals before the reaction will start. This is called the activation energy \u2014 it's often provided as heat. Enzymes lower the amount of activation energy that's needed, often making reactions happen at a lower temperature than they could without an enzyme. This speeds up the rate of reaction.When a substrate fits into the enzyme's active site it forms an enzyme-substrate complex \u2014 it's this that lowers the activation energy. Here are two reasons why:1) If two substrate molecules need to be joined, being attached to the enzyme holds them close together, reducing any repulsion between the molecules so they can bond more easily.2) If the enzyme is catalysing a breakdown reaction, fitting into the active site puts a strain on bonds in the substrate, so the substrate molecule breaks up more easily.chemical reaction beginsactivation ener^y_neede_d _ without enzymeenergy is released as the product is formedTime- chemical reaction without enzyme-chemicalreactionwithenzymeThe \u2018L o c k  and K e y \u2019 Model is a Good Start...Enzymes are a bit picky \u2014 they only work with substrates that fit their active site. Early scientists studying the action of enzymes came up with the lock and key' model. This is where the substrate fits into the enzyme in the same way that a key fits into a lock.enzyme is unchanged\ncomplexScientists soon realised that the lock and key model didn't give the full story. The enzyme and substrate do have to fit together in the first place, but new evidence showed that the enzyme-substrate complex changed shape slightly to complete the fit. This locks the substrate even more tightly to the enzyme. Scientists modified the old lock and key model and came up with the 'induced fit' model.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","4":"72Factors Affecting Enzyme ActivityNow you know what enzymes are and how they work, let's take a look at what makes them tick. Humans need things like money and the newest mobile phone, but enzymes are quite content with the right temperature and pH.Temperature has a Big Influence on Enzyme ActivityLike any chemical reaction, the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction increases when the temperature's increased. More heat means more kinetic energy, so molecules move faster. This makes the enzymes more likely to collide with the substrate molecules. The energy of these collisions also increases, which means each collision is more likely to result in a reaction. But, if the temperature gets too high, the reaction stops.1) The rise in temperature makes the enzyme's molecules vibrate more.2) If the temperature goes above a certain level, this vibration breaks some of the bonds that hold the enzyme in shape.3) The active site changes shape and the enzyme and substrate no longer fit together.4) At this point, the enzyme is denatured\u2014 it no longer functions as a catalyst.optimum temperature11 nn 11,TemperaturepH Also Affects Enzyme ActivityO\u2019\" \" I M I | | | ,, , ,~ Every enzyme has an enzyme is r optimum temperature = denatured r For most human enzymes - r ,t,saro^37\u00b0C but some r _ enzymes, like those used in ~- biological washing powders, ~ ~ can work well at 60 \u00b0C ~All enzymes have an optimum pH value. Most human enzymes work best at pH 7 (neutral), but there are exceptions. Pepsin, for example, works best at acidic pH 2, which is useful because it's found in the stomach. Above and below the optimum pH, the H+ and OH ions found in acids and alkalis can mess up the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds that hold the enzyme's tertiary structure in place. This makes the active site change shape, so the enzyme is denatured.Enzyme Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction1) The more enzyme molecules there are in a solution,the more likely a substrate molecule is to collide with one and form an enzyme-substrate complex. So increasing the concentration of the enzyme increases the rate of reaction.2) But, if the amount of substrate is limited, there comes a point when there's more than enough enzyme molecules to deal with all the available substrate, so adding more enzyme has no further effect.steady increase as more active sites are available \\if substrate amount is limited, an increase in enzyme concentration eventually has no further effectEnzyme ConcentrationSubstrate Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction Up to a Pointsteady increase as more substrate molecules are availableall active sites used \u2014 increase in substrate concentration has no further effectSubstrate Concentration1) The higher the substrate concentration, the faster the reaction \u2014 more substrate molecules means a collision between substrate and enzyme is more likely and so more active sites will be used. This is only true up until a 'saturation' point though. After that, there are so many substrate molecules that the enzymes have about as much as they can cope with(all the active sites are full), and adding more makes no difference.2) Substrate concentration decreases with time during a reaction (unless more substrate is added to the reaction mixture), so if no other variables are changed, the rate of reaction will decrease over time too. This makes the initial rate of reaction (the reaction rate at the start) the highest rate of reaction.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","5":"14Enzyme-Controlled ReactionsScience isn't all about words and theory\\ it's also about getting your pipette dirty and making bad smells (in the name of discovery of course).

It's easy to measure the volume of oxygen produced and to work out how fast it's given off. The diagram below shows the apparatus you'll need. The oxygen released displaces the water from the measuring cylinder. (A stand and clamp would also be pretty useful to hold the cylinder upside down, as would a stopwatch and a water bath.)Here's how to carry out the experiment:1)2)3)4)5)6)7)Set up boiling tubes containing the same volume and concentration of hydrogen peroxide.To keep the pH constant, add equal volumes of a suitable buffer solution to each tube.(A buffer solution is able to resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or alkali are added.)Set up the rest of the apparatus as shown in the diagram.Put each boiling tube in a water bath set to aupside down measuring cylindervolume ofdelivery tubeboiling tubehydrogen peroxide solution and catalase enzymeoxygen produced per minute is measuredtrough of <'*== waterdifferent temperature (e.g. 10 \u00b0C, 20 \u00b0C, 30 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C) along with another tube containing catalase (wait 5 minutes before moving onto the next step so the enzyme gets up to temperature).Use a pipette to add (he same volume and concentration of catalase to each boiling tube.

The diagram shows how the experiment can be set up. You'll need the apparatus shown in the diagram as well as a stopwatch. A drop of iodine in potassium iodide is put into each well on a spotting tile. A known concentration of amylase and starch are then mixed together in a test tube. A dropping pipette is used to put a drop of this mixture into one of the wells containing the iodine solution on the spotting tile at regular intervals and the resulting colour is observed. The iodine solution goes dark blue-black when starch is present but remains its normal browny-orange colour when there's no starch around. You can see how fast amylase is working by recording how long it takes for the iodine solution to no longer turn blue-black when starch\/amylase mixture is added. Repeat the experiment using different concentrations of amylase. Make sure that you also repeat the experiment three times at each amylase concentration.The experiments above show you how you can investigate the effects of temperature and enzyme concentration on the rate of enzyme-controlled reactions. You can also alter these experiments to investigate the effect of a different variable, such as pH (by adding a buffer solution with a different pH to each test tube) or substrate concentration (you could use serial dilutions to make substrate solutions with different concentrations). The key to experiments like this is to remember to only change one variable \u2014 everything else should stay the same.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","6":"76Topic I B \u2014 More Biological MoleculesDNA and RNAThese two pages are all about nucleic acids \u2014 DNA and RNA.

This means that there's genetic continuity between generations of cells (i.e. the cells produced by cell division inherit their genes from their parent cells).1)The enzyme DNA helicase breaks the hydrogen bondsbetween bases on the two polynucleotide DNA strands.

Energy from ATP is released through a hydrolysis reaction (see page 22).Water has a High Latent Heat of Vaporisation1) It takes a lot of energy (heat) to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules.2) So water has a high latent heat of vaporisation \u2014 a lot of energy is used up when water evaporates (vaporises).3) This is useful for living organisms because it means they can use water loss through evaporation to cool down (e.g. humans sweat to cool down) without losing too much water.Topic 1B \u2014 More Biological Molecules\n","9":"22ATPATP is an important molecule in all living things.

Ahh...ATP is the Immediate Source of Energy in a Cell1) Plant and animal cells release energy from glucose \u2014 this process is called respiration.2) A cell can't get its energy directly from glucose.3) So, in respiration, the energy released from glucose is used to make ATP (adenosine triphosphate).4) ATP is made from the nucleotide base adenine, combined with a ribose sugar and three phosphate groups. It's what's known as a nucleotide derivative because it's a modified form of a nucleotide:\n5) Once made, ATP diffuses to the part of the cell that needs energy.6) The energy in ATP is stored in high energy bonds between the phosphate groups. It's released via hydrolysis reactions (see below).ATP is Quickly Made and Used1) When energy is needed by a cell, ATP is broken down into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and P; (inorganic phosphate).2) This is a hydrolysis reaction. A phosphate bond is broken and energy is released.The reaction is catalysed by the enzyme ATP hydrolase.3) ATP hydrolysis can be 'coupled' to other energy-requiring reactions in the cell \u2014 this means the energy released can be used directly to make the coupled reaction happen, rather than being lost as heat.4) The released inorganic phosphate can also be put to use \u2014 it can be added to another compound (this is known as phosphorylation), which often makes the compound more reactive.5) ATP can be re-synthesised in a condensation reaction between ADP and Pr This happens during both respiration and photosynthesis, and is catalysed by the enzyme ATP synthase.________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\u00a9\"'11111 \/1, iADP + P;adenosine diphosphate i.e. it has 2 phosphatesPhosphate groupsCONDENSATION(ENERGY USED)ATP--ATP synthaseadenosine triphosphate i.e. it has 3 phosphatesPhosphate groups\u00a9O\u00a91inorganicphosphateHYDROLYSIS (ENERGY RELEASED)\u00a9' 1 1 1 I 1 I I M 1 I I I I II \\,y- Inorganic phosphate 'r (P) is just the- fancy name for a r- single phosphate. ^\/ 1 1 I I I M I I I I I I | | I ITopic 1B \u2014 More Biological Molecules\n''Hi i n'-\n","10":"23Inorganic IonsInorganic Ions Have an Electric Charge1) An ion is an atom (or group of atoms) that has an electric charge.2) An ion with a positive charge is called a cation.3) An ion with a negative charge is called an anion.4) An inorganic ion is one which doesn't contain carbon (although there are a few exceptions to this rule).5) There are inorganic ions, in solution, in the cytoplasms of cells and in the body fluids of organisms.Each ion has a specific role, depending on its properties.

It helps to protect bacteria from attack by cells of the immune system.The cytoplasm of a prokaryotic cell has no membrane-bound organelles (unlike a eukaryotic cell). It has ribosomes \u2014 but they're smaller than those in a eukaryotic cell.\nPlasmids are small loops of DNAthat aren't part of the main circular DNA molecule. Plasmids contain genes for things like antibiotic resistance, and can be passed between prokaryotes. Plasmids are not always present in prokaryotic cells. Some prokaryotic cells have several.Unlike a eukaryotic cell, a prokaryotic cell doesn't have a nucleus. Instead, the DNA floats free in the cytoplasm. It's circular DNA, present as one long coiled-up strand.It's not attached to any histone proteins (see p. 82).The flagellum (plural flagella) is a long, hair-like structure that rotates to make the prokaryotic cell move. Not all prokaryotes have a flagellum. Some have more than one.Just like in a eukaryotic cell, the plasma membrane is mainly made of lipids and proteins.

This means you can't use an optical microscope to view organelles smaller than 0.2 pm. That includes ribosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes. You may be able to make out mitochondria \u2014 but not in perfect detail. You can also see the nucleus.3) The maximum useful magnification of an optical microscope is about x 1500.1) TEMs use electromagnets to focus a beam of electrons, which is then transmitted through the specimen.2) Denser parts of the spccimcn absorb more electrons, which makes them look darker on the image you end up with.3) TEMs are good because they give high resolution images, so you see the internal structure of organelles like chloroplasts.4) But they can only be used on thin specimens.Electron microscopes ---------------------------------1) They use electrons to form an image.2) They have a higher resolution than optical microscopes so give a more detailed image (and can be used to look at more organelles).3) They have a maximum resolution of about 0.0002 micrometres (|jm).

Stains are used to highlight objects in a cell. For example, eosin is used to make the cytoplasm show up. Iodine in potassium iodide solution (see p. 4) is used to stain starch grains in plant cells.\u2022 Finally, add the cover slip (a square of clear plastic that protects the specimen). To do so, stand the slip upright on the slide, next to the water droplet. Then carefully tilt and lower it so it covers the specimen.Try not to get any air bubbles under there \u2014 they'll obstruct your view of the specimen (see page 35).Topic 2A \u2014 Cell Structure and Division\n","14":"32Cell Division \u2014 MitosisIf it wasn't for cell division, we'd still only be one cell big. If it wasn't for pies, my favourite jeans would still fit.Mitosis is Cell Division that Produces Genetically Identical CellsThere are two types of cell division in eukaryotes \u2014 mitosis and meiosis (see pages 88-89 for more on meiosis).1) In mitosis a parent cell divides to produce two genetically identical daughter cells(they contain an exact copy of the DNA of the parent cell).2) Mitosis is needed for the growth of multicellular organisms (like us) and for repairing damaged tissues.3) In multicellular organisms, not all cells keep their ability to divide (see next page). The ones that do, follow a cell cycle. Mitosis is part of the cell cycle:The cell cycle consists of a period of cell growth and DNA replication called interphase. Mitosis happens after that. Interphase (cell growth) is subdivided into three separate growth stages.These are called G,, S and G,.GAP PHASE 2cell keeps growing and proteins needed for cell division are madeSYNTHESIScell replicates its DNA,ready to divide by mitosisMITOSIS (the cycle starts and ends here)GAP PHASE 1 cell grows and new organelles and proteins are madeMitosis has Four Division StagesMitosis is really one continuous process, but it's described as a series of division stages \u2014 prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. Interphase comes before mitosis in the cell cycle.Interphase \u2014 The cell carries out normal functions, but also prepares to divide. The cell's DNA is unravelled and replicated, to double its genetic content. The organelles are also replicated so it has spare ones, and its ATP content is increased (ATP provides the energy needed for cell division).Prophase \u2014 The chromosomes. condense, getting shorter and fatter. Tiny bundles of protein called centrioles start moving to opposite ends of the cell, forming a network of protein fibres across it called the spindle. The nuclear envelope (the membrane around the nucleus) breaks down and chromosomes lie free in the cytoplasm.Centromere%CentromereAs mitosis begins, the chromosomes are made of two strands joined in the middle by a centromere. One chromatid The separate strands are called chromatids. , , ^There are two strands because chromatids each chromosome has already made an identical copy of itself during interphase.When mitosis is over, the chromatids end up as one-strand chromosomes in the daughter cells.2)3)Metaphase \u2014 The chromosomes (each with two chromatids) line up along the middle of the cell and become attached to the spindle by their centromere.Anaphase \u2014The centromeres divide, separating each pair of sister chromatids. The spindles contract, pulling chromatids to opposite poles (ends) of the spindle, centromere first.This makes the chromatids appear v-shaped.Sister chromatids moving to opposite poles of the spindle4)Telophase \u2014 The chromatids reach the opposite poles on the spindle.They uncoil and become long and thin again. They're now called chromosomes again. A nuclear envelope forms around each group of chromosomes, so there are now two nuclei. The cytoplasm divides (cytokinesis) and there are now two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the original cell and to each other.

Make sure you're wearing safety goggles and a lab coat before you start. You should also wear gloves when using stains.1)2)3)4)5)6) 7)Stained Root Cells8)9)Cut 1 cm from the tip from a growing root (e.g. of an onion). It needs to be the tip because that's where growth occurs (and so that's where mitosis takes place).If you're using ethano-orcein to stain the cells, the tips will also need to be fixed in ethanoic acid.Prepare a boiling tube containing 1 M hydrochloric acid and put it in a water bath at 60 \u00b0C. Transfer the root tip into the boiling tube and incubate for about 5 minutes.Use a pipette to rinse the root tip well with cold water. Leave the tip to dry on a paper towel.Place the root tip on a microscope slide and cut 2 mm from the very tip of it. Get rid of the rest.Use a mounted needle to break the tip open and spread the cells out thinly.Add a few drops of stain and leave it for a few minutes.The stain will make the chromosomes easier to see under a Telophase microscope. There are loads of different stains, all with crazy names (toluidine blue O, ethano-orcein, Feulgen stain...If you're using the beulgen stain, you'll need an extra rinse.Place a cover slip over the cells and push down firmly to squash the tissue. This will make the tissue thinner and allow light to pass through it. Don't smear the cover slip sideways (or you'll damage the chromosomes).Now you can look at all the stages of mitosis under an optical microscope (see below).

A plant root tip is constantly growing, so you'd expect a high mitotic index (i.e. lots of cells in mitosis). In other tissue samples, a high mitotic index could mean that tissue repair is taking place or that there is cancerous growth in the tissue.Topic 2 A \u2014 Cell Structure and Division\n","16":"36Topic 2B \u2014 Cell MembranesCell Membrane StructureYou might remember a bit about cell membranes from p. 25. Well now it's time to delve a little deeper...Membranes Control What Passes Through ThemAll cells are surrounded by membranes. In eukaryotic cells,many of the organelles are surrounded by membranes too.1)2)Cell-surface membranes surround cells. They are a barrier between the cell and its environment, controlling which substances enter and leave the cell. They're partially permeable \u2014 they let some molecules through but not others. Substances can move across the cell-surface membrane by diffusion, osmosis or active transport (see pages 38-43).The membranes around organelles divide the cell into different compartments \u2014 they act as a barrier between the organelle and the cytoplasm. They are also partially permeable and control what substances enter and leave the organelle.Cell Membranes have a Fluid Mosaic\u2019 StructurePartially permeable membranes can be useful at sea.The basic structure of all cell membranes is pretty much the same. They're composed of lipids (mainly phospholipids \u2014 see page 7), proteins and carbohydrates (attached to proteins or lipids).1)2)3)4)5)In 1972, the fluid mosaic model was suggested to describe the arrangement of molecules in the membrane.

They bind to the cholesterolhydrophobic tails of the phospholipids, causing them to pack more closely together.This restricts the movement of the phospholipids, making the membrane less fluid and more rigid.Cholesterol helps to maintain the shape of animal cells (which don't have cell walls). This is particularly important for cells that aren't supported by other cells, e.g. red blood cells, which float free in the blood.Topic 2B \u2014 Cell Membranes\n","17":"38Exchange Across Cell Membranes \u2014 DiffusionOoooh it's starting to get a bit more exciting... here's how some substances can get across cell membranes without using energy, just what you've always wanted to know, I bet.Diffusion is the Passive Movement of Particles1) Diffusion is the net movement of particles (molecules or ions) from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.2) Molecules will diffuse both ways, but the net movement will be to the area of lower concentration. This continues until particles are evenly distributed throughout the liquid or gas.3) The concentration gradient is the path from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Particles diffuse down a concentration gradient4) Diffusion is a passive process \u2014 no energy is needed for it to happen.5) Particles can diffuse across cell membranes, as long as they can move freely through the membrane.111' h 1 I I I  I  I IF! , M,,,, (\/Polar molecules have Z ~ Partlal positive and negative ~ charges (see p. 20).

They're also non-polar, which makes them soluble in lipids, so they can dissolve in the hydrophobic bilayer.6) When molecules diffuse directly through a cell membrane, it's also known as simple diffusion.Facilitated Diffusion uses Carrier Proteins and Protein Channels1) Some larger molecules (e.g. amino acids, glucose) would diffuse extremely slowly through the phospholipid bilayer because they're so big.2) Charged particles, e.g. ions and polar molecules, would also diffuse slowly \u2014 that'sbecause they're water soluble, and the centre of the bilayer is hydrophobic (see page 36).3) So to speed things up, large or charged particles diffuse through carrier proteins or channel proteins in the membrane instead \u2014 this is called facilitated diffusion.4) Like diffusion, facilitated diffusion moves particles down a concentration gradient, from a higher to a lower concentration.5) It's also a passive process \u2014 it doesn't use energy.'fiAndy needed all his concentration for this particular gradient...Carrier proteins move large molecules across membranes, down their concentration gradient.

The process is pretty similar to facilitated diffusion (see p. 38) \u2014 a molecule attaches to the carrier protein, the protein changes shape and this moves the molecule across the membrane, releasing it on the other side.There are two main differences between active transport and facilitated diffusion though:1) Active transport usually moves solutes from a low to a high concentration\u2014 in facilitated diffusion, they always move from a high to a low concentration.2) Active transport requires energy \u2014 facilitated diffusion does not.\u2022 ATP is a common source of energy in the cell.

Infectious diseases can be really nasty, but luckily there's an army of cells in the body that helps lo protect us \u2014 the immune system.Foreign Antigens Trigger an Immune ResponseAntigens are molecules (usually proteins) that can generate an immune response when clctected by the body.They arc usually found on the surface of cells and are used by the immune system to identify: pathogens (organisms that cause disease), abnormal body cells (e.g. cancerous or pathogen-infected cells, which have abnormal antigens on their surface), toxins and cells from other individuals of the same species (e.g. organ transplants).There are four main stages in the immune response:(T) Phagocytes Engulf PathogensA phagocyte (e.g. a macrophage) is a type of white blood cell that carries out phagocytosis (engulfment of pathogens). They're found in the blood and in tissues and are the first cells to respond to an immune system trigger inside the body. Here's how they work:1) A phagocyte recognises the foreign antigens on a pathogen.2) The cytoplasm of the phagocyte moves round the pathogen, engulfing it.3) The pathogen is now contained in a phagocytic vacuole (a bubble) in the cytoplasm of the phagocyte.4) A lysosome (an organelle that contain enzymes called lysozymes) fuses with the phagocytic vacuole. The lysozymes break down the pathogen.5) The phagocyte then presents the pathogen's antigens \u2014 it sticks the antigens on its surface to activate other immune system cells.nucleuscytoplasmlysosomeantigens on surface ofphagocyte engulfs the pathogenlysosome fuses with phagocytic vacuole(2) Phagocytes Activate T-cellsA T-cell {also called a T-lymphocyte) is another type of white blood cell. It has receptor proteins on its surface that bind to complementary antigens presented to it by phagocytes. This activates the T-cell. Different types of T-cells respond in different ways. For example, helper T-cells {TH cells) release chemical signals that activate and stimulate phagocytes and cytotoxic T-cells (Tc cells), which kill abnormal and foreign cells B-cells, which secrete antibodies (see below).Th cells also activate(3) T-cells Activate B-cells, Which Divide into Plasma CellsB-cells (also called B-lymphocytes) are also a type of white blood cell. They're covered with antibodies \u2014 proteins that bind antigens to form an antigen-antibody complex. Each B-cell has a different shaped antibody on its membrane, so different ones bind to different shaped antigens.1) When the antibody on the surface of a B-cell meets a complementary shaped antigen, it binds to it.2) This, together with substances released from helper T-cells, activates the B-cell. This process is called clonal selection.3) The activated B-cell divides into plasma cells.(V) Plasma Cells Make More Antibodies to a Specific AntigenPlasma cells are identical to the B-cell (they're clones). They secrete loads of antibodies specific to the antigen. These are called monoclonal antibodies. They bind to the antigens on the surface of the pathogen to form lots of antigen-antibody complexes,An antibody has two binding sites, so can bind to two pathogens at the same time. This means that pathogens become clumped together \u2014 this is called agglutination. Phagocytes then bind to the antibodies and phagocytose many pathogens at once. This process leads to the destruction of pathogens carrying this antigen in the body.variableregions(orange)constan regions (blue)heavychainAntibodies are proteins \u2014 they're made up of chains of amino acids.The specificity of an antibody depends on its variable regions, which form the antigen binding sites. Each antibody has a variable region with a unique tertiary structure {due to different amino acid sequences) that's complementary to one specific antigen. All antibodies have the same constant regions.Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","21":"46Immunity and VaccinesThe primary response gives us immunity against a disease, but only after you've become infected. If only there was a way to stimulate memory cell production without getting the disease... well, there is \u2014 vaccination.Vaccines can Protect Individuals and Populations Against Disease1) While your B-cells are busy dividing to build up their numbers to deal with a pathogen (i.e. the primary response \u2014 see previous page), you suffer from the disease. Vaccination can help avoid this.2) Vaccines contain antigens that cause your body to produce memory cells against a particular pathogen, without the pathogen causing disease. This means you become immune without getting any symptoms.3) Vaccines protect individuals that have them and, because they reduce the occurrence of the disease, those not vaccinated are also less likely to catch the disease (because there are fewer people to catch it from). This is called herd immunity.4) Vaccines always contain antigens \u2014 these may be free or attached to a dead or attenuated (weakened) pathogen.5) Vaccines may be injected or taken orally. The disadvantages of taking a vaccine orally are that it could be broken down by enzymes in the gut or the molecules of the vaccine may be too large to be absorbed into the blood.6) Sometimes booster vaccines are given later on (e.g. after several years) to make sure that memory cells are produced.Antigenic Variation Helps Some Pathogens Evade the Immune System1) Antigens on the surface of pathogens activate the primary response.2) When you're infected a second time with the same pathogen (which has the same antigens on its surface) they activate the secondary response and you don't get ill.3) However, some sneaky pathogens can change their surface antigens. This antigen variability is called antigenic variation. (Different antigens are formed due to changes in the genes of a pathogen.)4) This means that when you're infected for a second time, the memory cells produced from the first infection will not recognise the different antigens. So the immune system has to start from scratch and carry out a primary response against these new antigens.5) This primary response takes time to get rid of the infection, which is why you get ill again.6) Antigenic variation also makes it difficult to develop vaccines against some pathogens for the same reason. Examples of pathogens that show antigenic variation include HIV and the influenza virus.7) Here's how antigenic variation affects the production of vaccines to help prevent people catching influenza:1) The influenza (flu) vaccine changes every year. That's because the antigens on the surface of the influenza virus change regularly, forming new strains of the virus.2) Memory cells produced from vaccination with one strain of the flu will not recognise other strains with different antigens. The strains are immunologically distinct.3) Every year there are different strains of the influenza virus circulating in the population, so a different vaccine has to be made.4) New vaccines are developed and one is chosen every year that is the most effective against the recently circulating influenza viruses.5) Governments and health authorities then implement a programme of vaccination using the most suitable vaccine.1st infection\n2nd infectiondifferent antigensThe oral vaccine was proving hard to swallow.\nTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","22":"48Antibodies in MedicineAntibodies aren't only great for fighting off infection, they're also excellent tools for use in medical diagnosis and drug development. Let's all give three cheers for antibodies. Without them, we'd all probably be dead by now.Monoclonal Antibodies can be used to Target Specific Substances or Cells1) Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies produced from a single group of genetically identical B-cells(plasma cells). This means that they're all identical in structure.2) As you know, antibodies are very specific because their binding sites have a unique tertiary structure (see p.44) that only one particular antigen will fit into (one with a complementary shape).3) You can make monoclonal antibodies that bind to anything you want, e.g. a cell antigen or other substance, and they will only bind to (target) this molecule.EXAMPLE: Targeting drugs to a particular cell type \u2014 cancer cells1) Different cells in the body have different surface antigens.2) Cancer cells have antigens called tumour markers that are not found on normal body cells.3) Monoclonal antibodies can be made that will bind to the tumour markers.4) You can also attach anti-cancer drugs to the antibodies.5) When the antibodies come into contact with the canccr cells they will bind to the tumour markers.6) This means the drug will only accumulate in the body where there are cancer cells.7) So, the side effects of an antibody-based drug are lower than other drugs because they accumulate near specific cells.monoclonalantibodyantigen binding siteanti-cancer drugdrug attached to antibodyantibody binds to tumour markers on cancer cellcell-surface antigen\/\\----------------------------No0No------------------------------------------------------------\u2014L\nnormal body cell tumour marker cancer cellEXAMPLE: Targeting a particular substance for medical diagnosis \u2014 pregnancy testingPregnancy tests detect the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) that's found in the urine of pregnant women:1) The application area contains antibodies for hCG bound to a coloured bead (blue).2) When urine is applied to the application area any hCG will bind to the antibody on the beads, forming an antigen-antibody complex.3) The urine moves up the stick to the test strip, carrying any beads with it.4) The test strip contains antibodies to hCG that are stuck in place (immobilised).5) If there is hCG present the test strip turns blue because the immobilised antibody binds to any hCG \u2014 concentrating the hCG-antibody complex with the blue beads attached.If no hCG is present, the beads will pass through the test area without binding to anything, and so it won't go blue.coloured bead antibody \u00a9 ^ to hCGhCG\nappflow of liquidIimmobilised antibody to hCGication areatest stripTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","23":"50Interpreting Vaccine and Antibody DataIf someone claims anything about a vaccine or antibody, the claim has to be validated (confirmed) before it's accepted. To do this, you need to evaluate the data used to support the claim and the methodology behind it.New Knowledge About Vaccines and Antibodies is Validated by ScientistsWhen a study presents evidence for a new theory (e.g. a vaccine has a dangerous side effect) it's important that other scientists come up with more evidence to validate (confirm) the theory. Other scientists may repeat the study and try to reproduce the results, or conduct other studies to try to prove the same theory.EXAMPLE 1: The MMR Vaccine1) In 1998, a study was published about the safety of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.The study was based on 12 children with autism (a life-long developmental disability) and concluded that there may be a link between the MMR vaccine and autism.2) Not everyone was convinced by this study because it had a very small sample size of 12 children, which increased the likelihood of the results being due to chance. The study may have been biased because one of the scientists was helping to gain evidence for a lawsuit against the MMR vaccine manufacturer. Also, studies carried out by different scientists found no link between autism and the MMR vaccine.3) There have been further scientific studies to sort out the conflicting evidence. In 2005, a Japanese study was published about the incidence of autism in Yokohama (an area of Japan). They looked at the medical records of 30 000 children born between 1988 and 1996 and counted the number of children that developed autism before the age of seven. The MMR jab was first introduced in Japan in 1989 andwas stopped in 1993. During this time the MMR vaccine was administered to children at 12 months old. The graph shows the results of the study.4) In the exam you could be asked to evaluate evidence like this.\u2022 You might be asked to describe the data...The graph shows that the number of children diagnosed with autism continued to rise after the MMR vaccine was stopped. For example, from all the children born in 1992, who did receive the MMR jab, about 60 out of 10 000 were diagnosed with autism before the age of seven. However, from all the children born in 1994, who did not receive the MMR jab, about 160 out of 10 000 of them were diagnosed with autism before the age of seven.\u2022 ...or draw conclusions There is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\u2022 ... or evaluate the methodology You can be much more confident in this study, compared to the 1998 study, because the sample size was so large \u2014 30 000 children were studied. A larger sample size means that the results are less likely to be due to chance.EXAMPLE 2: Herceptin\u00ae\u2014 Monoclonal AntibodiesAbout 20% of women with breast cancer have tumours that produce more than the usual amount of a receptor called HER2. Herceptin1 is a drug used to treat this type of breast cancer \u2014 it contains monoclonal antibodies that bind the HER2 receptor on a tumour cell and prevent the cells from growing and dividing.In 2005, a study tested Herceptin\u00ae on women who had already undergone chemotherapy for HER2-type breast cancer. 1694 women took the drug for a year after chemotherapy and another 1694 women were observed for the same time (the control group). The results are shown in the graph on the right.Describe the data: Almost twice as many women in the control groupdeveloped breast cancer again or died compared to the group taking Herceptin\u00ae.Draw conclusions: A one-year treatment with Herceptin\u00ae, after chemotherapy, increases the disease-free survival rate for women with HER2-type breast cancer.250\nHerceptin* * Control Group of womenYear of birth 19-I ' 1 \/ I I I \/ II I u I I ( I l \\ l I | l I I\/\/ \u00a3 Have a look at pages 213-214 r for more about drawing : conclusions and evaluating. :''i 1111111 n 1111 n 11 \/i \\ 11111 \\\\N\nTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","24":"52HIV and VirusesViruses aren't cells like bacteria. They're not even living things \u2014 they can only reproduce inside the cells of another organism (called the host). All viruses cause disease, and you need to know all about one particularly nasty blighter...HIV is the Virus That Causes AIDS1) HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that affects the immune system.It eventually leads to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).2) AIDS is a condition where the immune system deteriorates and eventually fails. This makes someone with AIDS more vulnerable to other infections, like pneumonia (see next page).3) HIV infects (and eventually kills) helperT-cells, which act as the host cells (see p. 28) for the virus. Remember, helper T-cells send chemical signals that activate phagocytes, cytotoxic T-cells and B-cells (see p. 44) so they're hugely important cells in the immune response. Without enough helper T-cells, the immune system is unable to mount an effective response to infections because other immune system cells don't behave how they should.4) People infected with HIV develop AIDS when the helper T-cell numbers in their body reach a critically low level.HIV has a Spherical StructureYou might get asked about the structure of HIV in your exam1) A core that contains the genetic material (RNA) and some proteins (including the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is needed for virus replication).2) An outer coating of protein called a capsid.3) An extra outer layer called an envelope. This is made of membrane stolen from the cell membrane of a previous host cell.4) Sticking out from the envelope are loads of copies of an attachment protein that help HIV attach to thehost helper T-cell.HIV Replicates Inside its Host\u2019s Helper T-CellsHIV (and all other viruses) can only reproduce inside the cells of the organism it has infected. HIV replicates inside the helper T-cells of the host. It doesn't have the equipment (such as enzymes and ribosomes) to replicate on its own, so it uses those of the host cell.Here's how HIV replicates:1) The attachment protein attaches to a receptor molecule on the cell membrane of the host helper T-cell.2) The capsid is released into the cell, where it uncoats and releases the genetic material (RNA) into the cell's cytoplasm.3) Inside the cell, reverse transcriptase is used to make a complementary strand of DNA from the viral RNA template (see p. 16-17 for more on DNA and RNA).4) From this, double-stranded DNA is made and inserted into the human DNA.5) Host cell enzymes are used to make viral proteins from theviral DNA found within the human DNA.6) The viral proteins are assembled into new viruses, which bud from the cell and go on to infect other cells.During the initial infection period, HIV replicates rapidly and the infected person may experience severe flu-likesymptoms. After this period, HIV replication drops to a lower level. This is the latency period. During the latency period (which can last for years), the infected person won't experience any symptoms.Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\u00a9HIVhelper T cellDNA\u00a9\u00aev \u201c \u201c  DAttachment protein CapsidS1 , \" \"........................u-n,,,,,._ ttachnient proteins can also -EnvelopeGeneticmaterialReverse transcriptase\n","25":"54Topic 3A \u2014 Exchange and Transport SystemsSize and Surface AreaExchanging things with the environment is pretty easy if you're a single-celled organism, but if you're multicellular it all gets a bit more complicated... and it's all down to this 'surface area to volume ratio' malarkey.Organisms Need to Exchange Substances with their EnvironmentEvery organism, whatever its size, needs to exchange things with its environment.Otherwise there'd be no such thing as poop scoops...1) Cells need to take in oxygen (for aerobic respiration) and nutrients.2) They also need to excrete waste products like carbon dioxide and urea.3) Most organisms need to stay at roughly the same temperature, Raj was g|ac| he'd exchangedSO heat needs to be exchanged too. his canoe for a bigger boat.How easy the exchange of substances is depends on the organism's surface area to volume ratio.Smaller Animals have Higher Surface Area : Volume RatiosA mouse has a bigger surface area relative to its volume than a hippo.

The diffusion rate is quick because of the small distances the substances have to travel (see p. 39).2) In multicellular animals, diffusion across the outer membrane is too slow, for two reasons:\u2022 Some cells are deep within the body \u2014 there's a big distance between them and the outside environment.\u2022 Larger animals have a low surface area to volume ratio \u2014 it's difficult to exchange enough substances to supply a large volume of animal through a relatively small outer surface.So rather than using straightforward diffusion to absorb and excrete substances, multicellular animals need specialised exchange organs (like lungs \u2014 see p. 58).They also need an efficient system to carry substances to and from their individual cells \u2014 this is mass transport.In mammals, 'mass transport' normally refers to the circulatory system (see p. 70), which uses blood to carry glucose and oxygen around the body. It also carries hormones, antibodies (p. 44) and waste like CO,.Mass transport in plants involves the transport of water and solutes in the xylem and phloem (see pages 78 and 80).Topic 3 A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","26":"56Gas ExchangeLots of organisms have developed adaptations to improve their rate of gas exchange. It's a tricky business if you're an insect or a plant though \u2014 you've got to exchange enough gas but avoid losing all your water and drying to a crisp...Gas Exchange Surfaces have Two Major AdaptationsMost gas exchange surfaces have two things in common:1) They have a large surface area.2) They're thin (often just one layer of epithelial cells)\u2014 this provides a short diffusion pathway across the gas exchange surfaceThe organism also maintains a steep concentration gradient of gases across the exchange surface.All these features increase the rate of diffusion \u2014see page 39.Single-celled Organisms Exchange Gases across their Body Surface1) Single-celled organisms absorb and release gases by diffusion through their outer surface.2) They have a relatively large surface area, a thin surface and a short diffusion pathway (oxygen can take part in biochemical reactions as soon as it diffuses into the cell)\u2014 so there's no need for a gas exchange system.Fish Use a Counter-Current System for Gas ExchangeThere's a lower concentration of oxygen in water than in air. So fish have special adaptations to get enough of it.1) Water, containing oxygen, enters the fish through its mouth and passes out through the gills.2) Each gill is made of lots of thin plates called gill filaments, which give a big surface area for exchange of gases.3) The gill filaments are covered in lots of tiny structures called artcry ___^ \/(plural = lamellae)lamellae, which increase the surface area even more.4) The lamellae have lots of blood capillaries and a thin surface layer of cells to speed up diffusion.artery (deoxygenated blood to gill)artery (oxygenated blood from the gill)lamella\nblood leaves lamella with high oxygen conc.Water flowing towards the lamella (relatively high oxygen conc.'blood enters lamella with low oxygen conc.Water flowing away from the lamella (relatively low oxygen conc.)gill filaments5) Blood flows through the lamellae in one direction and water flows over in the opposite direction.

You need to know the structure of the lungs as well as how they're ventilated... take a deep breath...Lungs are Specialised Organs for Gas ExchangeHumans need to get oxygen into the blood (for respiration) and they need to get rid of carbon dioxide (made by respiring cells).

This can make it more difficult to breathe and reduce the rate of gas exchange.Measures of Lung Function Can Help to Diagnose Lung DiseasesLung diseases affect both ventilation (breathing) and gas exchange in the lungs \u2014 in other words, how well the lungs function. Doctors can carry out tests to investigate lung function and diagnose a lung disease. You might be asked to interpret results from tests like these in your exams. Here are some terms you might come across:1) Tidal volume is the volume of air in each breath \u2014 usually between 0.4 dm* and 0.5 dm* for adults.2) Ventilation rate is the number of breaths per minute. For a healthy person at rest it's about 15 breaths.3) Forced expiratory volumet (FEV1) is the maximum volume of air that can be breathed out in 1 second.4) Forced vital capacity (FVC) is the maximum volume of air it is possible to sV\\n m u n m i m ibreathe forcefully out of the lungs after a really deep breath in. \u201c stan s \u00b0r. z0\/1 - decimetres cubed, -X 1 dm3 is the same -You can figure out tidal volume, ventilation rate and other measures of breathing from the graph produced from a spirometer (a fancy machine that scientists and doctors use to measure the volume of air breathed in and out):9. as a litre. :\nMeasuring tidal volume is one of the hardest jobs in the world.Different Diseases Affect the Lungs in Different WaysHere are some examples of different lung diseases and how they affect breathing.Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB)1) When someone becomes infected with tuberculosis bacteria, immune system cells build a wall around the bacteria in the lungs. This forms small, hard lumps known as tubercles.2) Infected tissue within the tubercles dies and the gaseous exchange surface is damaged, so tidal volume is decreased.3) Tuberculosis also causes fibrosis (see below), which further reduces the tidal volume.4) A reduced tidal volume means less air can be inhaled with each breath. In order to take in enough oxygen, patients have to breathe faster, i.e. ventilation rate is increased.5) Common symptoms include a persistent cough, coughing up blood and mucus, chest pains, shortness of breath and fatigue.Fibrosis1) Fibrosis is the formation of scar tissue in the lungs.This can be the result of an infection or exposure to substances like asbestos or dust.2) Scar tissue is thicker and less elastic than normal lung tissue.3) This means that the lungs are less able to expand and so can't hold as much air as normal \u2014 tidal volume is reduced, and so is FVC (i.e. a smaller volume of air can be forcefully breathed out).4) There's a reduction in the rate of gaseous exchange \u2014 diffusion is slower across a thicker scarred membrane.5) Symptoms of fibrosis include shortness of breath, a dry cough, chest pain, fatigue and weakness.6) Fibrosis sufferers have a faster ventilation rate than normal \u2014 to get enough air into their lungs to oxygenate their blood.Topic 3A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","29":"62Interpreting Lung Disease DataIt's very possible that you could be asked to interpret some data on lung disease in the exam. So being my usual nice sell I've given you some examples to show you how to do it. I know it looks a bit dull but believe me, it'll really help.You Need to be Able to Interpret Data on Risk Factors and Lung Disease1) All diseases have factors that will increase a person's chance of getting that disease. These are called risk factors. For example, it's widely known that if you smoke you're more likely to get lung cancer (smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer).2) This is an example of a correlation \u2014 a link between two things (see page 213). However, a correlation doesn't always mean that one thing causes the other. Smokers have an increased risk of getting cancer but that doesn't necessarily mean smoking causes the disease \u2014 there are lots of other factors to take into consideration.3) You need to be able to describe and analyse data given to you in your exams.Here's an example of the sort of thing you might get:EXAMPLE 1 \u2014 SMOKING AND LUNG CANCER\nCcQ nsO5040O-C d5 Uun T5302010Percentage of males aged 16 and over who smoked manufactured cigarettes in Great Britain\u2022\/vYear\u0000ip No) cv nrooooo120iAge-standardised mortality rates for male lung cancer in the United Kingdom1003 CX- o80604020Year of deaths<0 kOYou might be asked to:1) Describe the data \u2014 The graph on the left shows that the number of adult males in Great Britain who smoke decreased between 1990 and 2012. The graph on the right shows that the male lung cancer mortality (death) rate decreased between 1990 and 2012 in the United Kingdom.2) Draw conclusions \u2014You need to be careful what you say here. There's a correlation (link) between the number of males who smoked and the mortality rate for male lung cancer. But you can't say that one caused the other. There could be other reasons for the trend, e.g. deaths due to lung cancer may have decreased because less asbestos was being used in homes (not because fewer people were smoking).Other points to consider \u2014 The graph on the right shows mortality (death) rates. The rate of cases of lung cancer may have been increasing but medical advances may mean more people were surviving (so only mortality was decreasing).You might also need to evaluate the way in which scientific data has led to government restrictions on the sources of risk factors. E.g.Responses to dataMedical studies in 1950s and 1960s documented the link between smoking and various forms of cancer, particularly lung cancer. The evidence prompted the first voluntary agreement between the UK government and tobacco companies in 1971, which stated that tobacco products and adverts should carry a health warning label. As of October 2008, picture health warnings were made compulsory on all UK boxes of cigarettes after studies suggested they were more effective than written warnings alone.Topic 3A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","30":"64Dissecting Gas Exchange SystemsAfter learning all about how different organisms are adapted for efficient gas exchange, you might be wondering what those structures really look like.

They're protected on eachside by a bony flap called an operculum and supported by gill arches.4) To remove the gills, push back the operculum and use scissors to carefully remove the gills. Cut each gill arch through the bone at the top and bottom. They should look a bit like this:5) If you look closely, you should be able to see the gill filaments.N\\\/1 I II I i \/1 I I II I M I I II I II 11 u u 111 i ii I I II I M II I i u I II I II II n I I I I I I I I I 11^- For more nformation about the structure and function of fish gills, see page 56. - 1 w n 11 H ' i u 11 h 11 h 11111111 m i m i m 111 m 111 ii m i w i m 11 m w n ^A single gill archoperculum (the gills are under here)\ngill filamentsTopic 3 A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","31":"146Topic 6C \u2014 HomeostasisHomeostasis BasicsAh, there's nothing like learning a nice long word to start you off on a new section \u2014 welcome to homeostasis.Homeostasis is the Maintenance of a Stable Internal Environment1) Changes in your external environment can affect your internal environment\u2014 the blood and tissue fluid that surrounds your cells.2) Homeostasis involves control systems that keep your internal environment roughly constant (within certain limits).3) Keeping your internal environment stable is vital for cells to function normally and to stop them being damaged.4) It's particularly important to maintain the right core body temperature and blood pH. This is because temperature and pH affect enzyme activity, and enzymes control the rate of metabolic reactions:\u2022 If body temperature is too high (e.g. 40 \u00b0C) enzymes may becomc denatured. The enzyme's molecules vibrate too much, which breaks the hydrogen bonds that hold them in their 3D shape.The shape of the enzyme's active site is changed and it no longer works as a catalyst.This means metabolic reactions are less efficient.\u2022 If body temperature is too low enzyme activity is reduced, slowing the rate of metabolic reactions.\u2022 The highest rate of enzyme activity happens at their optimum temperature (about 37 \u00b0C in humans).\u2022 If blood pH is too high or too low (highly alkaline or acidic) enzymes become denatured. The hydrogen bonds that hold them in their 3D shape are broken, so the shape of the enzyme's active site is changed and it no longer works as a catalyst. This means metabolic reactions are less efficient.\u2022 The highest rate of enzyme activity happens at their optimum pH \u2014 usually around pH 7 (neutral), but some enzymes work best at other pHs, e.g. enzymes found in the stomach work best at a low pH.5) It's important to maintain the right concentration of glucose in the blood because cells need glucose for energy. Blood glucose concentration also affects the water potential of blood \u2014 this is the potential (likelihood)of water molecules to diffuse out of or into a solution.\u2022 If blood glucose concentration is too high the water potential of blood is reduced to a point where water molecules diffuse out of cells into the blood by osmosis.This can cause the cells to shrivel up and die.\u2022 If blood glucose concentration is too low, cells are unable to carry out normal activities because there isn't enough glucose for respiration to provide energy.Homeostatic Systems Detect a Change and Respond by Negative Feedback1)2)3)4)5)6)Homeostatic systems involve receptors, a communication system and effectors (like the nervous system \u2014 see page 128).Receptors detect when a level is too high or too low, and the information's communicated via the nervous system or the hormonal system to effectors.The effectors respond to counteract the change \u2014 bringing the level back to normal. The mechanism that restores the level to normal is called a negative feedback mechanism.Negative feedback keeps things around the normal level, e.g. body temperature is usually kept within 0.5 \u00b0C above or below 37 \u00b0C.Negative feedback only works within certain limits though \u2014 if the change is too big then the effectors may not be able to counteract it, e.g. a huge drop in body temperature caused by prolonged exposure to cold weather may be too large to counteract.Control of body temperature by negative feedback:body detects temperature's too hotyour internal environment stays around the normal level (37 \u00b0C)body detects temperature's too coldeffectors respond to increase the temperaturetimea>ouJ3u\nTopic 6C \u2014 Homeostasis\n","32":"148Control of Blood Glucose ConcentrationThese pages are all about how homeostasis sorts out your blood glucose level so you can keep revising.Eating and Exercise Change the Concentration of Glucose in your Blood1) All cells need a constant energy supply to work \u2014 so blood glucose concentration must be carefully controlled.2) The concentration of glucose in the blood is normally around 90 mg per 100 cm3 of blood.It's monitored by cells in the pancreas.3) Blood glucose concentration rises after eating food containing carbohydrate.Blood glucose concentration falls after exercise, as more glucose is used in respiration to release energy.Insulin and Glucagon Control Blood Glucose ConcentrationThe hormonal system controls blood glucose concentration using two hormones called insulin and glucagon.Like all hormones, insulin and glucagon travel in the blood to .... , ,, ,their target cells (effectors).

This involves increasing the number of channel proteins in the cell membranes (see next page for more).Insulin also activates enzymes in liver and muscle cells that convert glucose into glycogen. The cells are able to store glycogen in their cytoplasm, as an energy source.The process of forming glycogen from glucose is called glycogenesis.Insulin also increases the rate of respiration of glucose, especially in muscle cells.i |l I II I \/11 ir Liver cells are C f also called E^ Hepatocytes. ~\/' I I I I W I | | | |\\N\"GLYCOGENGlucagon raises blood glucose concentration when it's too lowglycogenesis 11 glycogenolysiss \\l ^activated activatedby insulin \u00bb by glucagon^ .I gluconeogenesisGLYCEROL AMINO ACIDS1) Glucagon binds to specific receptors on the cell membranes of liver cells.2) Glucagon activates enzymes in liver cells that break down glycogen into glucose3) The process of breaking down glycogen is called glycogenolysis.4) Glucagon also activates enzymes that are involved in the formation of glucose from glycerol (a component of lipids) and amino acids.5) The process of forming glucose from non-carbohydrates is called gluconeogenesis6) Glucagon decreases the rate of respiration of glucose in cells.Because they travel in the blood to their target cells, the responses produced by hormones are slower than those produced by nervous impulses (which are very quick \u2014 see page 129).

This process is called ultrafiltration.4) Useful substances, such as glucose and the right amount of water, are then reabsorbed back into the blood. This process is called selective reabsorption.5) The remaining unwanted substances pass along to the bladder and are excreted as urine.Blood is Filtered at the Start of the NephronsThe long tubules along with the bundle of capillarieswhere the blood is filtered are called nephrons \u2014there are around one million nephrons in each kidney.1) Blood from the renal artery enters smaller arterioles in the cortex of the kidney.2) Each arteriole splits into a structure called a glomerulus (plural, glomeruli) \u2014 a bundle of capillaries looped inside a hollow ball called a Bowman's capsule.3) This is where ultrafiltration takes place.4) The arteriole that takes blood into each glomerulus is called the afferent arteriole, and the arteriole that takes the filtered blood away from the glomerulus is called the efferent arteriole.5) The efferent arteriole is smaller in diameter than the afferent arteriole, so the blood in the glomerulus is under high pressure.6) The high pressure forces liquid and small molecules in the blood out of the capillary and into the Bowman's capsule.7) The liquid and small molecules pass through three layers to get into the Bowman's capsule and enter the nephron tubules \u2014 the capillary wall, a membrane (called the basement membrane) and the epithelium of the Bowman's capsule.8) Larger molecules like proteins and blood cells can't pass through, so stay in the blood. The substances that enter the Bowman's capsule are known as the glomerular filtrate.UltrafiltrationStructure of the Kidneys renal renal\n\u00a9CAPILLARYlarger molecules can't pass througho slit in BOWMAN'S, epithelium CAPSULE *basementmembranesmall molecules forced through11 *111 m 11111Ti i n i; ii, 5 You need to learn the = ~ structure of a nephron.

Water is also lost in sweat. The kidneys regulate the water potential of the blood (and urine),so the body has just the right amount of water \u2014 this is called osmoregulation.If the water potential of the blood is too low (the body is dehydrated), more water is reabsorbed by osmosis into the blood from the tubules of the nephrons.This means the urine is more concentrated, so less water is lost during excretion.If the water potential of the blood is too high (the body is too hydrated), less water is reabsorbed by osmosis into the blood from the tubules of the nephrons. This means the urine is more dilute, so more water is lost during excretion (see next page).3) Water is reabsorbed into the blood along almost all of the nephron (see previous page), but potential mainly takes place in the loop of Henle, DCT and collecting duct. The volume ofby the DCT and collecting duct is controlled by hormones (see next page).The Loop of Henle Maintains a Sodium Ion GradientThe loop of Henle is located in the medulla (inner layer) of the kidneys. It's made up of two 'limbs' \u2014 the descending limb and the ascending limb. The limbs control the movement of sodium ions so that water can be reabsorbed by the blood.(T) Near the top of the ascending limb, Na+ ions are pumped out into the medulla using active transport. The ascending limb is impermeable to water, so the water stays inside the tubule. This creates a low water potential in the medulla, because there's a high concentration of ions.KEY \u00ab=\u0000 Water moves out by osmosis Na moves by diffusion Na' moves by active transportCORTEX collecting\nflow of urine MEDULLA toureterV Because there's a lower water potential in the medulla than in the descending limb, water moves out of the descending limb (which is permeable to water) into the medulla by osmosis. This makes the filtrate more concentrated (the ions can't diffuse out \u2014 the descending limb isn't permeable to them). The water in the medulla is reabsorbed into the blood through the capillary network.L> Near the bottom of the ascending limb Na+ ions diffuse out into the medulla, further lowering the water potential in the medulla. The ascending limb is impermeable to water, so it stays in the tubule.\u00aeV Water moves out of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) by osmosis and is reabsorbed into the blood.{5J The first three stages massively increase the ion concentration in the medulla, which lowers the water potential. This causes water to move out of the collecting duct by osmosis. As before, the water in the medulla is reabsorbed into the blood through the capillary network.The volume of water reabsorbed into the capillaries is controlled by changing the permeability of the DCT and the collecting duct (see next page).Topic 6C \u2014 Homeostasis\n","35":"756Topic 7A \u2014 GeneticsInheritanceNope, this isn't about who gets Mum's best china \u2014 we're talking genetic inheritance here...-J' 11111 n a |,, |You Need to Know These Genetic TermsTERMDESCRIPTION '''''''''11' \u201c 11 'Uixu 11\u00a3GeneA sequence of bases on a DNA molecule that codes for a protein (polypeptide), which results in a characteristic, e.g. a gene for eye colour.AlleleA different version of a gene. There can be many different alleles of a single gene, but most plants and animals, including humans, only carry two alleles of each gene, one from each parent. The order of bases in each allele is slightly different \u2014 they code for different versions of the same characteristic. They're represented using letters, e.g. the allele for brown eyes (B) and the allele for blue eyes (b).GenotypeThe genetic constitution of an organism \u2014 the alleles an organism has, e.g. BB, Bb or bb for eye colour.PhenotypeThe expression of the genetic constitution and its interaction with the environment \u2014 an organism's characteristics, e.g. brown eyes.DominantAn allele whose characteristic appears in the phenotype even when there\u2019s only one copy.

When gametes from two parents fuse together, the alleles they contain form the genotype of the offspring produced. At each locus, the genotype can be homozygous or heterozygous.Genetic diagrams can be used to predict the genotypes and phenotypes of the offspring produced if two parents are crossed (bred). You need to know how to use genetic diagrams to interpret or predict the results of various crosses, including monohybrid crosses. Monohybrid inheritance is the inheritance of a characteristic controlled by a single gene. Monohybrid crosses show the likelihood of the different alleles of that gene (and so different versions of the characteristic) being inherited by offspring of certain parents.

This means colour blindness is much rarer in women than men.Parents'genotypesGametes'allelesPossible genotypes of offspringCarrier femaleUnaffected maleXN XnXN Y(g)XN XNX\"Y X\"XNXn YUnaffectedUnaffected Carrier Colour-blindfemalemalefemalemaleN \u2014 normal colour vision allele n \u2014 faulty colour vision allele7) In the example above, there's a 3 : 1 ratio of offspring without colour blindness : offspring with colour\u0000blindness. But when a female carrier and a male without colour-blindness have children (as in this example), only their male offspring are at risk of being colour-blind. So you can also say that there's a predicted 2:1:1 ratio \u2014 of female offspring without colour-blindness : male offspring without colour-blindness : male offspring with colour-blindness.8) This ratio will change if a female carrier (XNXn) and a male with colour-blindness (XnY) have children.The predicted ratio will then be 1 : 1 \u2014 of offspring with colour-blindness : offspring without colour-blindness. The ratio will be the same for offspring of each gender. You only end up with this predicted ratio for a monohybrid F, cross with a sex-linked characteristic.Some Autosomal Genes are LinkedD2)Autosome is the fancy name for any chromosome that isn't a sex chromosome.Autosomal genes are the genes located on the autosomes.Genes on the same autosome are said to be linked \u2014 because they're on the same autosome they'll stay together during the independent segregation of chromosomes in meiosis I, and their alleles will be passed on to the offspring together. The only reason this won't happen is if crossing over splits them up first3) The closer together two genes are on the autosome,the more closely they are said to be linked. This is because Genes A, B crossing over is less likely to split them up. T ^4) If two genes are autosomally linked, you won't get the ~ phenotypic ratio you expect in the offspring of a cross.5) For example, in a dihybrid cross between two heterozygous parents you'd expect a 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 ratio in the offspring (see previous page). Instead, the phenotypic ratio is more likely to be that expected for a monohybrid cross between two heterozygous parents (3:1) because the two autosomally-linked alleles are inherited together. This means that a higher proportion of the offspring will have their parents' (heterozygous) genotype and phenotype.6) This allows you to use the predicted phenotypic ratio to identify autosomal linkage.Topic 7A \u2014 Geneticsand C are all linked.Crossing over is when two homologous (paired) chromosomes swap bits'. It happens in meiosis I before independent segregation.

I stick in some maths. Surprise!The Chi-Squared Test Can Be Used to Check the Results of Genetic Crosses1) The chi-squared (%2) test is a statistical test that's used to see if the results of an experiment support a theory.2) First, the theory is used to predict a result \u2014 this is called the expected result.Then, the experiment is carried out and the actual result is recorded \u2014 this is called the observed result.3) To see if the results support the theory you have to make a hypothesis called the null hypothesis.4) The null hypothesis is always that there's no significant difference between the observed and expected results(your experimental result will usually be a bit different from what you expect, but you need to know if the difference is just due to chance, or because your theory is wrong).5) The x2 test is then carried out to compare the 'goodness of fit' of the observed and expected results(i.e. to compare how well the observed results match the expected results). The outcome either supports orrejects the null hypothesis.6) You can use the x2  test in genetics to test theories about the inheritance of characteristics. For example:Theory: Wing length in fruit flies is controlled by a single gene with two alleles (monohybrid inheritance).The dominant allele (N) gives normal wings, and the recessive allele (n) gives vestigial wings.Expected results: With monohybrid inheritance, if you cross a homozygous dominant parent with a homozygous recessive parent, you'd expect a 3 : 1 phenotypic ratio of normal : vestigial wings in the F, generation (see p. 156).Observed results: The experiment (of crossing a homozygous dominant parent with a homozygous recessive parent) is carried out on fruit flies and the number of F2 offspring with normal and vestigial wings is counted.Null hypothesis: There's no significant difference between the observed and \\ u i n n i \\ i' 111 _i' n 1111111' Mexpected results.

It predicts that the frequencies of alleles in a population won't change from one generation to the next.2) But this prediction is only true under certain conditions \u2014 it has to be a large population where there's no immigration, emigration, mutations or natural selection. There also needs to be random mating \u2014 all possible genotypes can breed with all others.3) The Hardy-Weinberg equations (see below) can be used to calculate the frequency of particular alleles, genotypes and phenotypes within populations.4) The equations can also be used to test whether or not the Hardy-Weinberg principle applies to particular alleles in particular populations, i.e. to test whether selection or any other factors are influencing allele frequencies.\u2014 if frequencies do change between generations in a large population then there is an influence of some kind.The Hardy-Weinberg Equations Can be Used to Predict Allele Frequency...When a gene has two alleles, you can figure out the frequency of one of the alleles of the gene if you know the frequency of the other allele, using this equation:Where: p = the frequency of one allele, usually the dominant oneq = the frequency of the other allele, usually the recessive oneThe total frequency of all possible alleles for a characteristic in a certain population is lO. So the frequencies of the individual alleles (e.g. the dominant one and the recessive one) must add up to 1.0.E.g. a species of plant has either red or white flowers.

Variation within a species means that individuals in a populationx\\' ' 1 i i i r h i i i i i i i | , ,- Variation within a C r species is also called 5- intraspecific variation -can show a wide range of different phenotypes.Although individuals of the same species have the same genes, they have different alleles (versions of genes) \u2014 this causes genetic variation within a species.The main source of this genetic variation is mutation, e.g. when changes in the DNA base sequence lead to the production of new alleles \u2014 see page 180. But genetic variation is also introduced during meiosis (through the crossing over of chromatids and the independent segregation of chromosomes) and because of the random fertilisation of gametes during sexual reproduction.Variation within a species can also be caused by differences in the environment, e.g. climate, food, lifestyle.Most variation within a species is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.But only genetic variation results in evolution.Evolution is a Change in Allele Frequencies Over TimeThe frequency of an allele in a population changes over time \u2014 this is evolution.Natural selection is one method by which evolution occurs.

Individuals with a phenotype that increases their chance of survival are more likely to survive, reproduce and pass on their genes (including the beneficial alleles that determine their phenotype), than individuals with a different phenotype.This means that a greater proportion of the next generation inherit the beneficial alleles. They, in turn, are more likely to survive, reproduce and pass on their genes.So the frequency of the beneficial alleles in the gene pool increases from generation to generation.\"i\"i n11! m i\/\/,- A selection pressure -r is anything that r- affects an organisms -- chance of survival Z- and reproduction -'<111 n \" 11 n n 1111Different Types of Natural Selection Lead to Different Frequency PatternsStabilising selection and directional selection are types of natural selection that affect allele frequency in different ways. You'll have covered these in Topic 4, but now there's an extra one to learn about \u2014 disruptive selection.STABILISING SELECTION is where individuals with alleles for characteristics towards the middle of the range are more likely to survive and reproduce. It occurs when the environment isn't changing, and it reduces the range of possible phenotypes.Example: In any mammal population there's a range of fur length. In a stable climate, having fur at the extremes of this range reduces the chances of surviving as it's harder to maintain the right body temperature. Animals with alleles for average fur length are the most likely to survive, reproduce and pass on their alleles. So these alleles increase in frequency. The proportion of the population with average fur length increases and the range of fur lengths decreases.PARENTStotal populationbreedingpopulationfur lengthTopic 7B \u2014 Populations and Evolution\n","40":"168Speciation and Genetic DriftEver wondered how there are so many different species on planet Earth? Well read on and learn, my friend...Speciation is the Development of a New Species1) Speciation is the development of a new species from an existing species.2) Speciation occurs when populations of the same species become reproductively isolated \u2014 changes in allelefrequency cause changes in phenotype, which mean they can no longer interbreed to produce fertile offspring.3) This can happen when a physical barrier, e.g. a flood or an earthquake, divides a population of a species, causing some individuals to become separated from the main population.This is known as geographical isolation and leads to allopatric speciation.4) Alternatively, speciation can also occur when a population becomes reproductively isolated without any physical separation. This is known as sympatric speciation.Allopatric Speciation Requires Geographical Isolation1) Populations that are geographically separated will experience slightly different conditions.For example, there might be a different climate on each side of the physical barrier.2) This means the populations will experience different selection pressures and so different changes in allele frequencies could occur:\u2022 Different alleles will be more advantageous in the different populations. For example, if geographical separation places one population in a colder climate than before, longer fur length will be beneficial. Directional selection will then act on the alleles for fur length in this population,increasing the frequency of the allele for longer fur length.\u2022 Allele frequencies will also change as mutations (see p. 180) occur independently in each population.\u2022 Genetic drift may also affect the allele frequencies in one or both populations (see next page).3) The changes in allele frequency will lead to differences accumulating in the gene pools of the separated populations, causing changes in phenotype frequencies.4) Eventually, individuals from the different populations will have changed so much that they won't be able to breed with one another to produce fertile offspring \u2014 they'll have become reproductively isolated.5) The two groups will have become separate species, as shown in the diagram below.\nPopulation or individual*.

Sometimes, mutations can occur that increase the number of chromosomes. This is known as polyploidy.Individuals with different numbers of chromosomes can't reproduce sexually to give fertile offspring \u2014 so if a polyploid organism emerges in a diploid population, the polyploid organism will be reproductively isolated from the diploid organisms.If the polyploid organism then reproduces asexually, a new species could develop.Polyploidy can only lead to speciation if it doesn't prove fatal to the organism and more polyploid organisms can be produced.

It feeds by flying and catching insects using echolocation (high-pitched sounds) at a frequency of around 45 kHz.Soprano pipistrelle batThis bat lives in Britain in woodland areas, close to lakes or rivers.

Carrying capacity varies as a result of both abiotic and biotic factors (see below).3) Abiotic factors include the amount of light, water or space available, the temperature of the surroundings or the chemical composition of the surroundings. When abiotic conditions are ideal for a species, organisms can grow fast and reproduce successfully.E.g. when the temperature of a mammal's surroundings is the ideal temperature for metabolic reactions to take place, they don't have to use up as much energy maintaining their body temperature.This means more energy can be used for growth and reproduction, so their population size will increase.4) When abiotic conditions aren't ideal for a species, organisms can't grow as fast or reproduce as successfully.E.g. when the temperature of a mammal's surroundings is significantly lower or higher than their optimum body temperature, they have to use a lot of energy to maintain the right body temperature. This means less energy v\/ill be available for growth and reproduction, so their population size will decrease.(V) Interspecific Competition \u2014 Competition Between Different Species.and Because of Biotic Factors ....r the lMng features1) Interspecific competition is when organisms of different species compete with each other for the same resources, e.g. red and grey squirrels compete for the same food sources and habitats in the UK.2) Interspecific competition between two species can mean that the resources available to both populationsare reduced, e.g. if they share the same source of food, there will be less available to both of them.This means both populations will be limited by a lower amount of food. They'll have less energy for growth and reproduction, so the population sizes will be lower for both species. E.g. in areas where both red and grey squirrels live, both populations are smaller than they would be if there was only one species there.3) If two species are competing but one is better adapted to its surroundings than the other, the less well adapted species is likely to be out-competed\u2014 it won't be able to exist alongside the better adapted species.E.g. since the introduction of the grey squirrel to the UK, the native red squirrel has disappeared from large areas.

As the population increases, there'll be more organisms competing for the same amount of space and food.Eventually, resources such as food and space become limiting \u2014 there isn't enough for all the organisms. The population then begins to decline.A smaller population then means that there's less competition for space and food, which is better for growth and reproduction \u2014 so the population starts to grow again.Topic 7C \u2014 Populations in Ecosystems\n","43":"7 74Investigating PopulationsDon't just take my word about all this population stuff \u2014 you can go to a field and find out for yourself...You need to take a Random Sample from the Area You\u2019re InvestigatingMost of the time it'd be too time-consuming to measure the number of individuals in a species (population size) and the distribution of that species (i.e. where it's found) in the entire area you're investigating. Instead you take samples:1) Choose an area to sample \u2014 a small area within the area being investigated.2) Samples should be random to avoid bias, e.g. if you were investigating a field you could pick random samplesites by dividing the field into a grid and using a random number generator to select coordinates.3) Use an appropriate technique to take a sample of the population (see below).4) Repeat the process, taking as many samples as possible.This will reduce the likelihood that your results are down to chance.5) The number of individuals for the whole area can then be estimated by taking the mean ofthe data collected in each sample and multiplying it by the size of the whole area.Quadrats and Transects are used to Investigate Non-Motile OrganismsNon-motile organisms are ones that don't move about\u2014 like plants. Quadrats and transects can also be used to investigate slow-moving organisms, which include things like limpets.1) A quadrat is a square frame, usually divided into a grid of 100 smaller squares by strings attached across the frame.2) Quadrats are placed on the ground at different points within the area you're investigating.3) The species frequency (how often a species is found) or the number of individuals of each species is recorded in each quadrat.4) The percentage cover of a species can also be measured by counting how much of the quadrat is covered by the speciesthe area of this quadrat is 0.25 rrMeasuring % cover0.5 mI I Species A [~ ~ l Specif, B 42 squares 12 squaresyou count a square if it's more than half-covered.

To cover a larger distance, quadrats can be placed at intervals along the line (i.e. with spaces in between them). This is known as an interrupted belt transect.Mark-Release-Recapture is Used to Investigate More Motile SpeciesMark-release-recapture is a method used to measure the abundance of more motile species. Here's how it's done:1) Capture a sample of a species using an appropriate technique, e.g. you could use pitfall traps(a steep sided container sunk into the ground) to capture ground insects, and count them.2) Mark them in a harmless way, e.g. by putting a spot of paint on them, or by removing a tuft of fur.3) Release them back into their habitat.4) Wait a week, then take a second sample from the same population.5) Count how many of the second sample are marked.You can then use this equation to estimate the total population size.When using this method, you have to make a few assumptions:1) The marked sample has had enough time and opportunity to mix back in with the population.2) The marking hasn't affected the individuals' chances of survival (e.g. by making them more visible to predators), and the marking itself is still visible (e.g. it hasn't rubbed off).3) There are no changes in population size due to births, deaths and migration during the period of the study.Topic 7C \u2014 Populations in EcosystemsJ0ta| Number caught Number caughtpopulation = 'n sample in 2nd samplesize ____________Number marked in 2nd sample\n","44":"776SuccessionRepeat after me: successful succession involves several simple successive stages.Succession is the Process of Ecosystem ChangeEcosystems are dynamic \u2014 they are constantly changing. Succession is the process by which an ecosystem(see p. 170) changes over time. The biotic conditions (e.g. plant and animal communities) change n H , M mn 11\/as the abiotic conditions (e.g. water availability) change. There are two types of succession: ^ Remember \u20141) Primary succession \u2014 this happens on land that's been newly formed or exposed, e.g. ~ Abiotic ^non-tving' where a volcano has erupted to form a new rock surface, or where sea level has droppedexposing a new area of land. There's no soil or organic material to start with, e.g. just bare rock.2) Secondary succession \u2014 this happens on land that's been cleared of all the plants, but where the soil remains, e.g. after a forest fire or where a forest has been cut down by humans.Succession Occurs in a Series of Stages1)\n2)3)4)5)Primary succession starts when species colonise a new land surface. Seeds and spores are blown in by the wind and begin to grow. The first species to colonise the area are called pioneer species.\u2022 The abiotic conditions are hostile (harsh), e.g. there's no soil to retain water. Only pioneer species grow because they're specially adapted to cope with the harsh conditions, e.g. marram grass can grow on sand dunes near the sea because it has deep roots to get water and can tolerate the salty environment.\u2022 The pioneer species change the abiotic conditions \u2014 they die and microorganisms decompose the dead organic material (humus). This forms a basic soil.\u2022 This makes conditions less hostile, e.g. the basic soil helps to retain water, which means new organisms with different adaptations can move in and grow. These then die and are decomposed, adding more organic material, making the soil deeper and richer in minerals. This means larger plants like shrubs can start to grow in the deeper soil, which retains even more water.\u2022 Some new species may change (he environment so that it becomes less suitable for the previous species.E.g. sand sedge stabilises the sand through the growth of rhizomes (underground stems). This makes the conditions less suitable for marram grass, which needs constant reburial by sand in order to grow healthily.Secondary succession happens in the same way, but because there's already a soil layer succession starts at a later stage \u2014 the pioneer species in secondary succession are larger plants, e.g. shrubs.At each stage, different plants and animals that are better adapted for the improved conditions move in, out-compete the plants and animals that are already there, and become the dominant species in the ecosystem. As succession goes on, the ecosystem becomes more complex. New species move in alongside existing species, which means that biodiversity (the variety of living organisms) increases. xw 11M 111 m M ,The final stage is called the climax community \u2014 the ecosystem - This ----is supporting the largest and most complex community of plants and animals it can.

This means other species such as mosses can grow3) Larger plants that need more water can move in asthe soil deepens, e.g. grasses and small flowering plants. The soil continues to deepen as the larger plants die and are decomposed.4) Shrubs, ferns and small trees begin to grow, out-competing the grasses and smaller plants to become the dominant species. Diversity increases.5) Finally, the soil is deep and rich enough in nutrients to support large trees. These become the dominant species, and the climax community is formed.1111i11111111111 2)thin soilsmall trees (rowan and alder)fernslarge treesand ash)deep soilTopic 7C \u2014 Populations in Ecosystems\n","45":"178ConservationWho'cJ have thought conservation could be such a tricky business \u2014 cos I'm feeling nice, I'll try and explain why...There Can be Conflict Between Human Needs and Conservation1) Conservation is the protection and management of species and habitats (ecosystemsi in a sustainable way. Sustainable means that enough resources are taken to meet the needs of people today, without reducing the ability of people in the future to meet their own needs.2) Not everyone agrees with every conservation measure though \u2014 there's often conflict between human needs and conservation. Careful management is needed to find a balance between the two and maintain the sustainability of natural resources. Here's an example:\u2022 The Maasai Mara is a national reserve in Kenya. It's a large area of grassland (savannah) with lots of wildlife.\u2022 The Maasai people traditionally earn a living by raising livestock, such as cattle. This can bring them into conflict with conservationists \u2014 e.g. overgrazing by livestock can destroy grassland for wildlife.\u2022 Conservation trusts are working with the Maasai to help them make money from their land through conservation and ecotourism projects rather than farming, and to farm in a sustainable way. So the economic needs of the Maasai are met, while still allowing the area and its wildlife to be conserved.3) There are many different methods of conservation. Some focus on conserving a particular species, whilst others protect the habitat for all the species that live there. Here are some examples of conservation techniques:\u2022 Plants can be conserved using seedbanks, which are stores of lots of seeds from lots of different plant species. If the plants become extinct in the wild, the stored seeds can be used to grow new plants.\u2022 Fishing quotas are limits to the amount of certain fish species that fishermen are allowed to catch.Fishing quotas help to conserve fish species by reducing the numbers that are caught and killed.\u2022 Protected areas such as national parks and nature reserves protect habitats (and so protect the species in them) by restricting urban development, industrial development and farming.\u2022 Endangered species can be bred in captivity (e.g. a zoo) to increase their numbers, then returned to the wild.You May Have to Evaluate Evidence and Data About Conservation IssuesYou need to be able to evaluate any evidence or data about conservation projects and research that the examiners throw at you \u2014 so here's an example I made earlier:In recent years, native British bluebells have become less common in woodland areas. It's thought that this is due to the presence of non-native Spanish bluebells, which compete with the native species for a similar niche.An experiment was carried out to see if removing the invasive Spanish species would help to conserve the native species. Each year for 15 years the percentage cover of native species was estimated in a 50 m by 50 m area of woodland using random sampling and 250, 1 m2 quadrats. After five years, all the Spanish bluebells were removed. A similar-sized control woodland in which the Spanish bluebells remained untouched was also studied. The results are shown on the right. You might be asked to:= 100806040% cover of native British bluebells in a woodland\u2022Spanish species removed5 10years151) Describe the data:\u2022 For the first five years, the percentage cover of native bluebells fell \u0000 ^from 50% to around 25%. After the Spanish species was removed, it increased from around 25% to around 45% in ten years.\u2022 The control experiment shows a fairly steady drop in native bluebell ^ percentage cover from 60% to 20% over the 15 years.2) Draw conclusions:The removal of Spanish bluebells resulted in an increase in the percentage cover of native bluebells over a ten year period. This suggests that the recent decrease in native British bluebells is due to competition with the Spanish bluebells.3) Ey^l.UAte_the..methQd;\u2022 The effects of some olher variables (e.g. changing weather) were removed by the control experiment, where the percentage cover of native bluebells continued to fall throughout the 15-year study.

You've already covered mutations in Topic 4, but now you need to know about them in more detail.Mutations are Changes to the Base Sequence of DNA1) Any change to the base (nucleotide) sequence of DNA is called a mutation.2) Mutations can be caused by errors during DNA replication.3) The rate of mutation can be increased by mutagenic agents (see next page).4) The types of mutations that can occur include:\u2022 Substitution \u2014 one or more bases are swapped for another, e.g. ATGCCT becomes ATTCCT.\u2022 Deletion \u2014 one or more bases are removed, e.g. ATGCCT becomes ATCCT.\u2022 Addition \u2014 one or more bases are added, e.g. ATGCCT becomes ATGACCT.\u2022 Duplication \u2014 one or more bases are repeated, e.g. ATGCCT becomes ATGCCCCT.\u2022 Inversion \u2014 a sequence of bases is reversed, e.g. ATGCCT becomes ACCGTT.\u2022 Translocation \u2014 a sequence of bases is moved from one location in the genome to another.This could be movement within the same chromosome or movement to a different chromosome.5) The order of DNA bases in a gene determines the sequence of amino acids in a particular polypeptide. If a mutation occurs in a gene, the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide that it codes for could be changed.OriginalgeneMutatedgeneC T J__Lc_LA G AI 1 1G GI__Isubstitution here G C A......................G AJ\u2014L.G G J\u2014IDNAAmino acidOriginalGCTAlaninepolypeptideGATAspartic acidCAGGlutamineMutatedAGGArgininepolypeptideAlanine \u2014 Glutamine \u2014 Arginine6) Polypeptides make up proteins. A change in the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide may change the final 3D shape of the protein, which could mean that it doesn't work properly. E.g. a mutation in a polypeptide that makes up an enzyme may change the shape of the enzyme's active site. This may stop substrates from being able to bind to the active site, leaving the enzyme unable to catalyse the reaction.7) Some mutations can cause genetic disorders \u2014 inherited disorders caused by abnormal genes or chromosomes, e.g. cystic fibrosis. Some mutations can increase the likelihood of developing certain cancers, e.g. mutations of the gene BRCA1 can increase the chances of developing breast cancer.8) If a gamete (sex cell) containing a mutation for a genetic disorder or a type of 1 1\"11'111'1\"'1 > \/ n\/,cancer is fertilised, the mutation will be present in the new fetus formed \u2014 5 *ier\u00ae^'tary mutations 5these are called hereditary mutations because they are passed on to the offspring. \u00a3 hereditary mutati^^cr31 ^3. evolution (see page 166).

Here's more on how cancer can occur...Mutations in Genes Can Cause Uncontrolled Cell Growth1) Mutations that occur in individual cells after fertilisation (e.g. in adulthood) are called acquired mutations.2) If these mutations occur in the genes that control the rate of cell division (by mitosis), it can cause uncontrolled cell division.3) If a cell divides uncontrollably the result is a tumour \u2014 a mass of abnormal cells.Tumours that invade and destroy surrounding tissue are called cancers (see below).4) There are two types of gene that control cell division \u2014 tumour suppressor genesand proto-oncogenes. Mutations in these genes can cause cancer:Tumour suppressor genes can be inactivated if a mutation occurs in the DNA sequence.\nIf a mutation occurs in a tumour suppressor gene, the protein isn't produced. The cells divide uncontrollably (the rate of division increases) resulting in a tumour.The effect of a proto-oncogene can be increasedif a mutation occurs in the DNA sequence.A mutated proto-oncogene is called an oncogene.Proto-oncogeneIWhen functioning normally, proto-oncogenes stimulate cell division by producing proteins that make cells divide.Oncogene\nIf a mutation occurs in a proto-oncogene, the gene can become overactive. This stimulates the cells to divide uncontrollably (the rate of division increases) resulting in a tumour.Tumours can be Benign or Malignant (Cancerous)Tumours can develop for years without any obvious symptoms and can be quite large by the time they're discovered. Not all tumours are cancerous \u2014 there are two different types:1) Malignant tumours are cancers. They usually grow rapidly and invade and destroy surrounding tissues.Cells can break off the tumours and spread to other parts of the body in the bloodstream or lymphatic system.2) Benign tumours are not cancerous. They usually grow slower than malignant tumours and are often covered in fibrous tissue that stops cells invading other tissues. Benign tumours are often harmless,but they can cause blockages and put pressure on organs. Some benign tumours can become malignant.Tumour Cells Look and Function Differently to Normal CellsTumour cells can differ from normal cells in many different ways:1) They have an irregular shape.2) The nucleus is larger and darker than in normal cells. aSometimes the cells have more than one nucleus.3) They don't produce all the proteins needed to function correctly.4) They have different antigens on their surface.5) They don't respond to growth regulating processes.6) They divide (by mitosis) more frequently than normal cells.Topic 8A \u2014 Mutations and Gene ExpressionWhen functioning normally, tumour suppressor genes slow cell division by producing proteins that stop cells dividing or cause them to self-destruct (apoptosis).\n","48":"184Interpreting Data on CancerOkay... these pages are a bit daunting. Nevertheless, they're important. Some of the stuff is pretty hard to get your head around, so you'll have to concentrate. After that, take a break and relax. Maybe cut your toenails.Genetic and Environmental Factors Affect the Risk of CancerThere's no single cause for cancer but scientists have identified lots of different 'risk factors' \u2014 things that increase a person's chance of getting cancer. Risk factors can be either genetic or environmental:1) Genetic factors \u2014 some cancers are linked with specific inherited alleles. If you inherit that allele you're more likely to get that type of cancer (but it doesn't mean you'll definitely get that type of cancer).2) Environmental factors \u2014 exposure to radiation, lifestyle choices such as smoking, increased alcohol consumption, and a high-fat diet have all been linked to an increased chance of developing some cancers.It\u2019s Difficult to Interpret the Relative Contributions of Genes and Environment1) Data on variation can be very tricky to interpret because some characteristics can be affected by many different genes (they're polygenic) and many environmental factors.2) It's difficult to know which factors (genes or environment) are having the greatest effect.3) This makes it hard to draw conclusions about the causes of variation.f Example: The Effects of Genetic and Environmental Factors on Breast Cancer J25-\u00a7 20-Graph to show incidence of breast cancer defined by age and family history\n10-(\/)TO r J\u0000 Two first-degree relativesEl One first-degree relative\u0000 No relatives affectedEd.r 1 v r r i20 30 40 50 60 70Woman's current age \/ years First-degree relatives include mothers, sisters and daughtersThis graph shows how the incidence of breast cancer is affected by both age and family history.There's a positive correlation between incidence ofbreast cancer in women and the number of their first-degree relatives who have also had breast cancer. The effect of family history decreases with age, but the incidence of breast cancer is always higher in women with a close family history of the disease.

And here's why...Totipotent Stem Cells are Able to Mature into Any Type of Body Cell1) Multicellular organisms are made up from many different cell types that are specialised for their function, e.g. liver cells, muscle cells, white blood cells.2) All these specialised cell types originally came from stem cells.3) Stem cells are unspecialised cells that can develop into other types of cell.4) Stem cells divide to become new cells, which then become specialised.5) All multicellular organisms have some form of stem cell.6) Stem cells are found in the embryo (where they become all the specialised cells needed to form a fetus) and in some adult tissues (where they become specialised cells that need to be replaced, e.g. stem cells in the intestines constantly replace intestinal epithelial cells).7) Stem cells that can mature (develop) into any type of body cell in an organism,(including the cells that make up the placenta in mammals) are called totipotent cells.8) Totipotent stem cells are only present in mammals in the first few cell divisions of an embryo.9) After this point the embryonic stem cells become pluripotent. They can still specialise into any cell in the body, but lose the ability to become the cells that make up the placenta.10) The stem cells present in adult mammals are either:\u2022 Multipotent stem cells \u2014 These are able to differentiate into a few different types of cell. For example, both red and white blood cells can be formed from multipotent stem cells found in bone marrow.\u2022 Unipotent stem cells \u2014 These can only differentiate into one type of cell.For example, there's a type of unipotent stem cell that can only divide to produce epidermal skin cells, which make up the outer layer of your skin.Stem Cells Become Specialised Because Different Genes are ExpressedStem cells become specialised because during their development, they only transcribe and translate part of their DNA:1)2)3)4)5)6)Stem cells all contain the same genes \u2014 but during development, not all of them are transcribed and translated (expressed).\"Mill III,, ,, m\u201e(\/- Remember: transcription is 3 Z when DNA is copied into ^- mRNA.

Other genes, such as those involved in removing the nucleus, are expressed too. Many other genes are not expressed (switched off), resulting in a specialised red blood cell.Topic 8A \u2014 Mutations and Gene Expression\n","50":"190Regulation of Transcription and TranslationThese pages cover some of the ways that transcription and translation are regulated. It's really all incredibly clever.Transcription Factors Control the Transcription of Target GenesYou should remember from Topic 4 that transcription is when a gene is copied from DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA). The enzyme responsible for synthesising mRNA from DNA is called RNA polymerase.1) All the cells in an organism carry the same genes (DNA) but the structure and function of different cells varies.2) This is because not all the genes in a cell are expressed (transcribed and used to make a protein).3) Because different genes are expressed, different proteins are made and these proteins modify the cell \u2014 they determine the cell structure and control cell processes (including the expression of more genes, which produce more proteins).4) The transcription of genes is controlled by protein molecules called transcription factors:1) In eukaryotes, transcription factors move from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.2) In the nucleus they bind to specific DNA sites near the start of their target genes \u2014 the genes they control the expression of.3) They control expression by controlling the rate of transcription.4) Some transcription factors, called activators, stimulate or increase the rate of transcription\u2014 e.g. they help RNA polymerase bindto the start of the target gene and activate transcription.5) Other transcription factors, called repressors, inhibit or decrease the rate of transcription\u2014 e.g. they bind to the start of the target gene, preventing RNA polymerase from binding, stopping transcription.StartActivatorTranscription factorsRepressorBlockedpolymerase X from binding\/Oestrogen Can Initiate the Transcription of Target GenesThe expression of genes can also be affectedby other molecules in the cell, e.g. oestrogen1) Oestrogen is a steroid hormone that can affect transcription by binding to a transcription factor called an oestrogen receptor, forming an oestrogen-oestrogen receptor complex.2) The complex moves from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where it binds to specific DNA sites near the start of the target gene.3) The complex can act as an activator of transcription, e.g. helping RNA polymerase bind to the start of the target gene........Oestrogen Oestrogen-oestrogen Oestrogen receptor receptor complexCytoplasmStart of gene ActivatorNucleus^RNApolymerase \/y\nTopic 8A \u2014 Mutations and Gene Expression\n","51":"193Epigenetic Control of Gene ExpressionEpigenetic changes are another way of controlling gene expression. If you thought transcription factors and the like were clever; then you're in for a real treat with this lot. Prepare to have your mind well and truly blown...Epigenetic Control Can Determine Whether or Not a Gene is Expressed1) In eukaryotes, epigenetic control can determine whether a gene is switched on or off\u2014 i.e. whether the gene is expressed (transcribed and translated) or not.2) It works through the attachment or removal of chemical groups (known as epigenetic marks) to or from DNA or histone proteins (see below).3) These epigenetic marks don't alter the base sequence of DNA.4) Instead, they alter how easy it is for the enzymes and other proteins needed for transcription to interact with and transcribe the DNA.5) Epigenetic changes to gene expression play a role in lots of normal cellular processes and can also occur in response to changes in the environment \u2014 e.g. pollution and availability of food.Epigenetic Changes Can be Inherited by Offspring1) Organisms inherit their DNA base sequence from their parents.2) Most epigenetic marks on the DNA are removed between generations, but some escape the removal process and are passed on to offspring.3) This means that the expression of some genes in the offspring can be affected by environmental changes that affected their parents or grandparents.4) For example, epigenetic changes in some plants in response to drought have been shown to be passed on to later generations.Increased Methylation of DNA Switches a Gene OffOne method of epigenetic control is methylation of DNA:1) This is when a methyl group (an example of an epigenetic mark) is attached to the DNA coding for a gene.2) The group always attaches at a CpG site, which is where a cytosine and guanine ^ \u2022 m n m m jbase are next to each other in the DNA (linked by a phosphodiester bond). ^ |s ^roup z3) Increased methylation changes the DNA structure so that the transcriptional machinery *1'' 11 \/ \/ w i, (enzymes, proteins etc.) can't interact with the gene \u2014 so the gene is not expressed (i.e. it's switched off).Decreased Acetylation of Histones Can also Switch Genes OffHistones are proteins that DNA wraps around to form chromatin, which makes up chromosomes.Chromatin can be highly condensed or less condensed. How condensed it is affects the accessibility of the DNA and whether or not it can be transcribed.1) Histones can be epigenetically modified by the addition or removal of acetyl groups (which are another example of an epigenetic mark)2) When histones are acetylated, the chromatin is less condensed.This means that the transcriptional machinery can access the DNA, allowing genes to be transcribed.3) When acetyl groups are removed from the histones, the chromatin* becomes highly condensed and genes in the DNA can't be transcribed because the transcriptional machinery can't physically access them.4) Histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes are responsible for removing the acetyl groups.Chromatin is less condensed^ Acetyl group COCHj COCH3 COCH3DNAHistone COCH3 COCH, COCH3 proteinChromatin is highly condensed DNAHistone proteinThis epigenetic change, caused by environmental exposure to too many cheesy CGP jokes, has been passed on to three generations so far.\nTopic 8A \u2014 Mutations and Cene Expression\n","52":"195Evaluating Data on PhenotypesWe're finally at the end of the section... and what a whopper it was \u2014 hut before you rush off to the next one, there's a little bit to learn about the relative influences of genetics and the environment on phenotype...You Might Have to Evaluate Data About Influences on PhenotypesThe phenotype (characteristics) of an organism is the result of the organism's genotype and the interaction of its genotype with the environment (see page 156). It's not always clear how much a phenotype is influenced by genes and how much it's influenced by the environment. Let's take a look at these examples:Example 1 \u2014 Overeating1) Overeating was thought to be caused only by environmental factors, like an increased availability of food in developed countries.2) It was later discovered that food consumption increases brain dopamine levels in animals.3) Once enough dopamine was released, people would stop eating.4) Researchers discovered that people with one particular allele had 30% fewer dopamine receptors.5) They found that people with this particular allele were more likely to overeat \u2014 they wouldn't stop eating when dopamine levels increased.6) Based on this evidence, scientists now think that overeating has both genetic and environmental causes.Example 2 \u2014Antioxidants1) Many foods in our diet contain antioxidants\u2014 compounds that are thought to play a role in preventing chronic diseases.2) Foods such as berries contain high levels of antioxidants.3) Scientists thought that the berries produced by different species of plant contained different levels of antioxidants because of genetic factors.4) But experiments that were carried out to see if environmental conditions affected antioxidant levels found that environmental conditions caused a great deal of variation.5) Scientists now believe that antioxidant levels in berries are due to both genetic and environmental factors.In the exam, you might have to evaluate data on the relative influences of genes and the environment on phenotype. This data may come from twin studies...Twin Studies Can Help to Determine Influences on PhenotypeStudies of identical twins are extremely useful when trying to determine what's due to environmental factors and what's due to genetic factors.These twins are genetically identical, so any differences in phenotype must be entirely due to environmental factors. If a characteristic is very similar in identical twins, genetics probably plays a more important role.

From sequencing the entire human genome to chopping out bits of DNA to insert into other organisms, you never know what scientists will get up to next.Sequencing Projects Have Read Entire Genomes1) A genome is the entire set of DNA, including all the genes in an organism.2) Improvements in technology have allowed us to sequence thegenomes of a variety of organisms, from bacteria to humans.3) Gene sequencing methods only work on fragments of DNA. So if you want to sequence the entire genome of an organism, you need to chop it up into smaller pieces first. The smaller pieces are sequenced and then put back in order to give the sequence of the whole genome.4) The Human Genome Project, which was completed in 2003, mapped the entire sequence of the human genome for the first time.Sequencing the Genome of Simple Organisms Helps Identify their Proteins1) The proteome of an organism is all the proteins that are made by it.2) You might remember from Topic 4 that while some parts of the genome code for specific proteins, some parts don't code for anything at all (the DNA is non-coding).3) Simple organisms, such as bacteria, don't have much non-coding DNA.4) This means it is relatively easy to determine their proteome from the DNA sequence of their genome.5) This can be useful in medical research and development. For example, identifying the protein antigens on thesurface of disease-causing bacteria and viruses can help in the development of vaccines to prevent the disease.N. meningitidis group B bacteria cause meningitis B. Sequencing the genome of these bacteria helped researchers identify antigens for use in developing a vaccine against the disease.Remember: vaccines contain antigens that cause your body to produce memory cells. If you're later infected by a pathogen with - the same antigens, your memory cells will quickly recognise it and divide to produce antibodies against it \u2014 so you don't get sick.Example:It\u2019s Harder to Translate the Genome of Complex Organisms1) More complex organisms contain large sections of non-coding DNA.2) They also contain complex regulatory genes, which determine when the genes that code for particular proteins should be switched on and off.3) This makes it more difficult to translate their genome into their proteome, because it's hard to find the bits that code for proteins among thenon-coding and regulatory DNA.

This process is called ligation.4) The new combination of bases in the DNA (vector DNA + DNA fragment) is called recombinant DNA.Step 2 \u2014 The Vector Transfers the DNA Fragment into Host Cells1) The vector with the recombinant DNA is used to transfer the gene into cells (called host cells).2) If a plasmid vector is used, host cells have to be persuaded to take in the plasmid vector and its DNA.E.g. host bacterial cells are placed into ice-cold calcium chloride solution to make their cell walls more permeable. The plasmids are added and the mixture is heat-shocked (heated to around 42 \u00b0C for 1-2 minutes), which encourages the cells to take in the plasmids.3) With a bacteriophage vector, the bacteriophage will infect the host bacterium by injecting its DNA into it. The phage DNA (with the target gene in it) then integrates into the bacterial DNA.4) Host cells that take up the vectors containing the gene of interest are said to be transformed.Step 3 \u2014 Identifying Transformed Host CellsOnly around 5% of host cells will take up the vector and its DNA, so it's important to be able to identify which cells have been transformed. Marker genes can be used to identify the transformed cells:1) Marker genes can be inserted into vectors at the same time as the gene to be cloned.This means any transformed host cells will contain the gene to be cloned and the marker gene.2) Host cells are grown on agar plates. Each cell divides and replicates its DNA, creating a colony of cloned cells. Transformed cells will produce colonies where all the cells contain the cloned gene and the marker gene.3) The marker gene can code for antibiotic resistance \u2014 host cells are grown on agar plates containing the specific antibiotic, so only transformed cells that have the marker gene will survive and grow. Or it can code for fluorescence \u2014 when the agar plate is placed under a UV light only transformed cells will fluoresce.4) Identified transformed cells are allowed to grow more, producing lots and lots of copies of the cloned gene.To Produce Proteins You Need Promoter and Terminator Regions1) If you want the transformed host cells to produce the protein coded for by the DNA fragment,you need to make sure that the vector contains specific promoter and terminator regions.2) Promoter regions are DNA sequences that tell the enzyme RNA polymerase when to start producing mRNA. Terminator regions tell it when to stop. Without the right promoter region, the DNA fragment won't be transcribed by the host cell and a protein won't be made.3) Promoter and terminator regions may be present in the vector DNA or they may have to be added in along with the fragment.Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n","55":"201Using Recombinant DNA TechnologyNow that you know how to make a DNA fragment and amplify it, it's probably a good time to tell you why you might want to.

Mwah ha hah.Transformed Organisms Are Made Using Recombinant DNA Technology1) Microorganisms, plants and animals can all be transformed using recombinant DNA technology. This is called genetic engineering.2) Transformed microorganisms can be made using the same technology as in vivo cloning (see page 199).

The plasmid is added to a bacterium and the bacterium is used as a vector to get the gene into the plant cells.If the right promoter region has been added along with the gene (see p. 199), the transformed cells will be able to produce the desired protein.Transformed animals can be produced too \u2014 a gene that codes for a desirable protein can be inserted into an early animal embryo or into the egg cells of a female. If the gene is inserted into a very early embryo, all the body cells of the resulting transformed animal will end up containing the gene. Inserting it into the egg cells means that when the female reproduces, all the cells of her offspring will contain the gene.Promoter regions that are only activated in specific cell types can be used to control exactly which of an animal's body cells the protein is produced in. If the protein is only produced in certain cells, it can be harvested more easily. Producing the protein in the wrong cells could also damage the organism.Recombinant DNA Technology Can be Used to Benefit HumansTransformed organisms (microorganisms, plants and animals) can be used in a variety of ways. You need to be able to interpret information about how they are used. Here are some examples:AgricultureAgricultural crops can be transformed so that they give higher yields or are more nutritious. This means these plants can be used to reduce the risk of famine and malnutrition. Crops can also be transformed to have pest resistance, so that fewer pesticides are needed. This reduces costs and reduces any environmental problems associated with using pesticides.For example, Golden Rice is a variety of transformed rice. It contains one gene from a maize plant and one gene from a soil bacterium, which together enable the rice to produce beta-carotene. The beta-carotene is used by our bodies to produce vitamin A. Golden Rice is being developed to reduce vitamin A deficiency in areas where there's a shortage of dietary vitamin A, e.g. south Asia, Africa. Vitamin A deficiency is a big problem in these areas, e.g. up to 500 000 children per year worldwide go blind due to vitamin A deficiency.IndustryIndustrial processes often use biological catalysts (enzymes). These enzymes can be produced from transformed organisms, so they can be produced in large quantities for less money, reducing costs.For example, chymosin (or rennin) is an enzyme used in cheese-making. It used to be made from rennet (a substance produced in the stomach of cows), but it can now be produced by transformed organisms. This means it can be made in large quantities, relatively cheaply and without killing any cows, making some cheese suitable for vegetarians.MedicineMany drugs and vaccines are produced by transformed organisms, using recombinant DNA technology. They can be made quickly, cheaply and in large quantities using this method.For example, insulin is used to treat Type 1 diabetes and used to come from animals (cow, horse or pig pancreases). This insulin wasn't human insulin though, so it didn't work quite as well. Human insulin is now made from transformed microorganisms, using a cloned human insulin gene (see above).Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n","56":"204Gene Probes and Medical DiagnosisBeing able to manipulate DNA is also really useful for diagnosing medical problems.You can Look for Alleles Using DNA Probes and Hybridisation-r-PC GG C -i , i__probeT TDNA^1) DNA probes can be used to locate specific alleles of genes (e.g. on chromosomes) or to see if a person's DNA contains a mutated allele that causes a genetic disorder.2) DNA probes are short strands of DNA. They have a specific base sequence t athat's complementary to the base sequence of part of a target allele (the allele you're looking for, e.g. an allele that causes a genetic disorder).3) This means a DNA probe will bind (hybridise) to the target allele if it's present in a sample of DNA.4) A DNA probe also has a label attached, so that it can be detected. The two most common types of label are a radioactive label (detected using X-ray film) or a fluorescent label (detected using UV light)5) Here's how it's done:A A j____i...\nA sample of DNA is digested into fragments using restriction enzymes (see p. 197) and separated using electrophoresis (see p. 206).The separated DNA fragments are then transferred to a nylon membrane and incubated with the fluorescently labelled DNA probe.If the allele is present, the DNA probe will hybridise (bind) to it.The membrane is then exposed to UV light and if the gene is present there will be a fluorescent band. E.g. sample 3 has a visible band, so this patient has the allele6) Alternatively, the probe can be used as part of a DNA microarray, which can screen lots of genes at the same time:A DNA microarray is a glass slide with microscopic spots of different DNA probes attached to it in rows.A sample of fluorescently labelled human DNA is washed over the array.If the labelled human DNA contains any DNA sequences that match any of the probes, it will stick to the array. The array is washed, to remove any labelled DNA that hasn't stuck to it.The array is then visualised underUV light \u2014 any labelled DNA attachedto a probe will show up (fluoresce).Any spot that fluoresces means that the person's DNA contains that specific allele. E.g. if the probe is for a mutated allele that causes a genetic disorder, this person has the allele.A DNA MicroarravDNA probeNo DNA sticks to the probe \u2014 they don't have this mutation.\u0000w w -W W\u2022 o  \u2022 # <3f;\u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022o##fluorescent labelA AT T~T------f\u201cG G C C _i___L_1--1T C A G -I___I- DNA sample -DNA probe for a mutationThe labelled DNA sample sticks to the probe \u2014 they have this mutation.7)To produce a DNA probe, you first need to sequence the allele that you want to screen for (see page 196).

E.g. Huntington's disease is an inherited condition that affects the nervous system and does not usually start to display symptoms until a person is aged between 30 and 50. People with a family history of the disease may choose to be screened for the mutated allele to find out if they have inherited it. The NHS offers to screen all newborn babies for the inherited disorder cystic fibrosis (which can cause breathing and digestive difficulties) so that treatment for the condition can begin as soon as possible.2) ...help determine how a patient will respond to specific drugs (see next page). E.g. breast cancer can be caused by a mutation in the HER2 proto-oncogene and treated with the drug Herceptin\u00ae (see page 185). Herceptin\u00ae is only effective against this type of breast cancer because it targets a specific receptor. Screening for this particular mutation helps determine whether Herceptin\u00ae will be a useful treatment or not.3) ...help identify health risks. E.g. inheriting particular mutated alleles increases your risk of developing certain cancers (although it doesn't make it certain that you'll develop cancer). If a person knows they have these alleles, it might help them to make choices that could reduce the risk of the disease developing (see next page). However, some people are concerned that genetic screening may lead to discrimination by insurance companies and employers if people are known to have a high risk of developing a condition.Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n","57":"206Genetic FingerprintingWe've been able to identify people from their fingerprints for over 100 years, but now we can use their DNA instead.Genomes Contain Non-Coding Variable Number Tandem Repeats1) Not all of an organism's genome (all the genetic material in an organism) codes for proteins.2) Some of the genome consists of variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) \u2014 base sequencesthat don't code for proteins and repeat next to each other over and over {sometimes thousands of times), e.g. CATGCATGCATGCATG is a repeat of the non-coding base sequence CATG.3) The number of times these sequences are repeated differs from person to person, so the length of these sequences in nucleotides differs too. E.g. a four nucleotide sequence might be repeated 12 times in one person = 48 nucleotides (12 x 4), but repeated 16 times in another person = 64 nucleotides (16x4).4) The repeated sequences occur in lots of places in the genome. The number of times a sequence is repeated (and so the number of nucleotides) at different places in their genome can be compared between individuals\u2014 this is called genetic fingerprinting.5) The probability of two individuals having the same genetic fingerprint is very low because the chance of two individuals having the same number of VNTRs at each place they're found in DNA is very low.Electrophoresis Separates DNA Fragments to Make a Genetic FingerprintSo genetic fingerprints can be compared between different individuals. Now you need to know how one is made:\n6)7)number of nucleotides40<5?ng.tic Fingerprintingperson 1 person 2well containing DNAA sample of DNA is obtained, e.g. from a person's blood, saliva, etc.PCR (see page 200) is used to make many copies of the areas of DNA that contain the VNTRs\u2014 primers are used that bind to either side of these repeats and so the whole repeat is amplified.You end up with DNA fragments where the length (in nucleotides) corresponds to the number of repeats the person has at each specific position, e.g. one person may have 80 nucleotides, another person 120.A fluorescent tag is added to all the DNA fragments so they can be viewed under UV light.The DNA fragments undergo electrophoresis:\u2022 The DNA mixture is placed into a well in a slab of gel and covered in a buffer solution that conducts electricity.\u2022 An electrical current is passed through the gel \u2014 DNA fragments arc negatively charged, so they move towards the positive electrode at the far end of the gel.\u2022 Small DNA fragments move faster and travel further through the gel, so the DNA fragments separate according to size.The DNA fragments are viewed as bands under UV light\u2014 this is the genetic fingerprint.Two genetic fingerprints can be compared \u2014 e.g. if bothfingerprints have a band at the same location on the gel it means they have the same number of nucleotides and so the same number of VNTRs at that place \u2014 it's a match.The DNA fragments at locus 1 are the same length so person 1 has the same number of repeats as person 2.The DNA fragments at locus 2 are different lengths so person 1 has a different number of repeats from person 2gel with buffer on topgrey = locus 1 blue * locus 2 red =* locus 3Genetic Fingerprinting is Used to Determine Relationships and VariabilityGenetic fingerprinting has many uses, which include:\u2022 Determining genetic relationships \u2014 We inherit VNTR base sequences from our parents. Roughly half of the sequences come from each parent. This means the more bands on a genetic fingerprint that match, the more closely related (genetically similar) two people are. E.g. paternity tests are used to determine the biological father of a child by comparing genetic fingerprints. If lots of bands on the fingerprint match, then that person is most probably the child's father. The higher the number of places in the genome compared, the more accurate the test result.\u2022 Determining genetic variability within a population \u2014The greater the number of bands that don't match on a genetic fingerprint, the more genetically different people are. This means you can compare the number of repeats at several places in the genome for a population to find out how genetically varied that population is. E.g. the more the number of repeats varies at several places, the greater the genetic variability within a population.Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Proiects and Gene Technologies\n","58":"208Practical SkillsPlanning an ExperimentAs well as doing practical work in class, you can get asked about it in your exams too. Harsh I know.Before You Start Planning, Be Clear on What You\u2019re Trying to Find OutLike all scientists, you should start off by making a prediction or hypothesis \u2014 a specific testable statement, based on theory, about what will happen in the experiment. You then need to plan a good experiment that will provide evidence to support the prediction \u2014 or help disprove it.A Good Experiment Gives Results that are...D\\\\l I U I \\ I I I II 1\/ r I l My Z Precise results are 3 - sometimes referred - Z to as reliable results, c \"W; 111111 ii 1 if 11111Precise \u2014 precise results don't vary much from the mean. Precision is reduced by random error (the unpredictable way in which all measurements vary).Repeatable and reproducible \u2014 repeatable means that if the same person repeats the experiment using the same methods and equipment, they will get the same results. Reproducible means that if someone different does the experiment, using a slightly different method or piece of equipment, the results will still be the same. Valid \u2014 valid results answer the original question. To get valid results you need to control all the variables (see below) to make sure you're only testing the thing you want to.Accurate \u2014 accurate results are really close to the true answer. Human interpretation of a measurement (e.g. determining a colour change) can reduce the accuracy of results.Here are some things you need to consider when designing a good experiment:2)3)4)D2)EXAMPLE:3)Only one variable should be changed \u2014Variables are quantities that have the potential to change, e.g. pH. In an experiment you usually change one variable and measure its effect on another variable.\u2022 The variable that you change is called the independent variable.\u2022 The variable that you measure is called the dependent variable.All the other variables should be controlled \u2014When you're investigating a variable you need to keep everything else that could affect it constant.This means you can be sure that only your independent variable is affecting the thing you're measuring (the dependent variable).Negative controls should be used \u2014Negative controls are used to check that only the independent variable is affecting the dependent variable. Negative controls aren't expected to have any effect on the experiment.1)2)3)4)5)4)Investigating the effect of light intensity on rate of photosynthesis of Canadian pondweedLight intensity is the independent variable.Rate of photosynthesis is the dependent variable. pH, temperature and the time the pondweed is left should all stay the same (and the quantities should be recorded to allow someone else to reproduce the experiment).The experiment should be repeated at least three times for each light intensity used.A negative control, in which the experiment is carried out in the dark, should also be used.No photosynthesis should happen with this control.The experiment should be repeated at least three times and a mean should be calculated \u2014 this reduces the effect of random error on your experiment, which makes your results more precise. Doing repeats and getting similar results each time also shows that your data is repeatable and makes it more likely to be reproducible.Examiners love getting you to comment on experimental design or suggest improvements to methods \u2014 e.g. how a method could be improved to make the results more precise. So make sure you know how to design a good experiment.Select Appropriate Apparatus, Equipment and Techniques1) When you're planning an experiment you need to decide what it is you're going to measure and how often you're going to take measurements. E.g. if you're investigating the rate of respiration, you could either measure the volume of oxygen used over time or the volume of carbon dioxide produced over time. You could take measurements at, e.g. 30 second intervals or 60 second intervals.2) Then you need to choose the most appropriate apparatus, equipment and techniques for the experiment. E.g.\u2022 The measuring apparatus you use has to be sensitive enough to measure the changes you're looking for.For example, if you need to measure small changes in pH, a pH meter (which can measure pH to several decimal places) would be more sensitive than indicator paper.\u2022 The technique you use has to be the most appropriate one for your experiment. E.g. if you want to measure the concentration of glucose in an unknown solution, using a colorimeter in conjunction with quantitative Benedict's reagent (see page 151) will help you to get more accurate results than simply comparing the colour differences of the solutions by eye.Practical Skills\n","59":"210Processing and Presenting DataProcessing data means taking raw data and doing some calculations with it, to make it more useful.Processing the Data Helps You to Interpret itYou Need to be Able to Calculate Percentage Change and Ratios1) Calculating percentage change helps to quantify how much something has changed, e.g. the percentagechange in the growth rate of pea plants when a fertiliser is added. To calculate it you use this equation:A positive value shows an increase and a negative value shows a decrease.final value - original value 1 nn Percentage change = . . . , x 100\u00b0 b original valueE.g. a person's blood glucose concentration before a meal was 4.2 mmol dm 3.Two hours after a meal it was 6.5 mmol dm-3. Calculate the percentage change.6.5 - 4.2 c, So the person's blood glucose concentrationPercentage change = * 100 = 55% <2 s.f.) was 55V0 |,igher after the meal.2) Ratios can be used to compare lots of different types of quantities. E.g. an organism with a surface area to volume ratio of 2 : 1 would theoretically have a surface area twice as large as its volume.3) Ratios are usually most useful in their simplest (smallest) form. To simplify a ratio, divide each side by the same number. It's in its simplest form when there's nothing left you can divide by. To get a ratio of X : Y in the formX : 1, divide both sides by Y. E.g. to get 28 : 34 into the ratio of X : 1, divide both sides by 34. You get 0.82 : 1.You Need to be Able to Use Logarithms1) It's tricky to plot graphs with very small and very large numbers (e.g. both 0.1 and 1000) on the same axis.2) We can make it easier by converting values to their logarithms and plotting them on a logarithmic scale (e.g. a logl0 scale).3) On a log1() scale, each value is ten times larger than the value before. This means the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 on a log10 scale represent 10, 100, 1000 and 10 000 on a linear (normal) scale.-'y'\"\"\u2019,\"'.\"\" i\" \"mi in, it- i need to be able to read off a : ~ logarithmic scale on a q 71 M , M II II II I I I I H M , Ion a graph. - 11111 I if1log10 scale l linear scale r4) To calculate logarithms, you need to use the log button on your calculator.

To do this add together all the data values and divide by the total number of values in the sample.TesttubeMass (g)Mean (g) ^Range (g)Repeat 1Repeat 2Repeat 3A283732(28 + 37 + 32) -r 3 = 32.337-28 = 9B475160(47 + 51 + 60) -+ 3 = 52.760-47 = 13--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2) You might also need to calculate the range (how spread out the data is).^To do this find the largest data value and subtract the smallest data value from it.3) Standard deviation can be more useful than the range because it tells you how values are spread about the mean rather than just the total spread of data. A small standard deviation means the repeated results are all similar and close to the mean, i.e. they are precise.Like the mean, the median and mode are both types of average.\u2022 To calculate the median, put all your data in numerical order. The median is the middle value in this list.If you have an even number of values, the median is halfway between the middle two values.\u2022 To calculate the mode, count how many times each value comes up. The mode is the number thatappears most often. A set of data might not have a mode \u2014 or it might have more than one.Practical Skills\n","60":"213Drawing Conclusions and EvaluatingThere's no point in getting all those lovely results and just leaving it at that. You need to draw some conclusions.You Need to be Able to Draw Conclusions From Data1) Conclusions need to be valid. A conclusion can only be considered as valid if it uses valid data (see page 208).2) You can often draw conclusions by looking at the relationship (correlation) between two variables:Positive correlation As one variable increases the other increases.Negative correlation As one variable increases the other decreases.No correlation There is no relationship between the variables.3)4)5)6)You have to be very careful when drawing conclusions from data like this because a correlation between two variables doesn't always mean that a change in one variable causes a change in the other (the correlation could be due to chance or there could be a third variable having an effect).If there's a relationship between two variables and a change in one variable does cause a change in the other it's called a causal relationship.It can be concluded that a correlation is acausal relationship if every other variable that could possibly affect the result is controlled.When you're making a conclusion you can't makeThere is no correlation between the colour of your tights and the proportion of your life you spend upside down.\nbroad generalisations from data \u2014 you have to be very specific You can only conclude what the results show and no more.v in in 111 ii ii 11 n 11111 ii mi n ii i in 11111111 in !<\u0000, In reality this is very hard to do \u2014 correlations are - generally accepted to be causal relationships if lots of -- studies have found the same thing, and scientists have Z- figured out exactly how one factor causes the other. -'n\\ I I I I I I 1 I I I 111 \\ u \/1 I n M I I 11 \\ I I I I 11 w I I I II I I 11The graph shows the results from an investigation into the effect of concentration of plant growth factor X on the height of Plant Species A.

They're good for this because:1) The long hydrocarbon tails of the fatty acids contain lots of chemical energy\u2014 a load of energy is released when they're broken down. Because of these ^ CPtails, lipids contain about twice as much energy per gram as carbohydrates. q ^2) They're insoluble, so they don't affect the water potential (see p. 40) of r,the cell and cause water to enter the cells by osmosis (which would make them ^ ^swell). The triglycerides clump together as insoluble droplets in cells because ^ {\/the fatty acid tails are hydrophobic (water-repelling) \u2014 the tails face inwards, es &shielding themselves from water with their glycerol heads.Phospholipids make up the bilayer of cell membranes (see p. 36).Cell membranes control what enters and leaves a cell.1) Their heads are hydrophilic and their tails are hydrophobic, so they forma double layer with their heads facing out towards the water on either side.2) The centre of the bilayer is hydrophobic, so water-soluble substances can't easily pass through it \u2014 the membrane acts as a barrier to those substances.Use the Emulsion Test for LipidsIf you wanted to find out if there was any fat in aparticular food you could do the emulsion test:1) Shake the test substance with ethanol for about a minute so that it dissolves, then pour the solution into water.2) Any lipid will show up as a milky emulsion.3) The more lipid there is, the more noticeable the milky colour will be.Test substance and ethanolShakesAdd to waterMilky colour indicates lipidPractice QuestionsQ1 What type of bond is made from a condensation reaction between glycerol and a fatty acid molecule?Q2 Describe how you would test for lipids in a solution.Exam QuestionsQ1 Triglycerides have a hydrophobic tail.

But what are proteins? What do they look like? Well, for your enjoyment, here are the answers to all those questions and many, many more...Proteins are Made from Long Chains of Amino Acids1) The monomers of proteins are amino acids.2) A dipeptide is formed when two amino acids join together.3) A polypeptide is formed when more than two amino acids join together.4) Proteins are made up of one or more polypeptides.Grant's cries of \"die peptide, die\" could be heard for miles around.

They're much easier to explain if you describe their structure in four 'levels'. These levels are a protein's primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures.Primary Structure \u2014 this is the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain.Secondary Structure \u2014 the polypeptide chain doesn't remain flat and straight.Hydrogen bonds form between the amino acids in the chain.This makes it automatically coil into an alpha (a) helix or fold into a beta ((3) pleated sheet \u2014 this is the secondary structure.Tertiary Structure \u2014 the coiled or folded chain of amino acids is often coiled and folded further. More bonds form between different parts of the polypeptide chain, including hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds (attractions between negative and positive charges on different parts of the molecule).Disulfide bridges also form whenever two molecules of the amino acid cysteine come close together \u2014 the sulfur atom in one cysteine bonds to the sulfur atom in the other. For proteins made from a single polypeptide chain, the tertiary structure forms their final 3D structure.Quaternary Structure \u2014 some proteins are made of several different polypeptide chains held together by bonds. The quaternary structureis the way these polypeptide chains are assembled together. For proteins made from more than one polypeptide chain (e.g. haemoglobin, insulin, collagen), the quaternary structure is the protein's final 3D structure.amino acid\nTopic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","68":"10Enzyme ActionEnzymes crop up loads in biology \u2014 they're really useful 'cos they make reactions work quickly. So, whether you feel the need for some speed or not, read on \u2014 because you really need to know this basic stuff about enzymes.Enzymes are Biological CatalystsEnzymes speed up chemical reactions by acting as biological catalysts. A catalyst is a substance _1)2)3)4)5)6)- readior without being _r up in the reaction\"'t 11 n ' i\" 111\" 1Enzymes catalyse metabolic reactions \u2014 both at a cellular level (e.g. respiration) and for the organism as a whole (e.g. digestion in mammals).Enzymes can affect structures in an organism (e.g. enzymes are involved in the production of collagen, an important protein in the connective tissues of animals) as well as functions (like respiration).Enzyme action can be intracellular \u2014 within cells, or extracellular \u2014 outside cells.Enzymes are proteins (see previous page).Enzymes have an active site, which has a specific shape. The active site is the part of the enzyme where the substrate molecules (the substance that the enzyme interacts with) bind to.Enzymes are highly specific due to their tertiary structure (see next page).Enzymes Lower the Activation Energy of a ReactionIn a chemical reaction, a certain amount of energy needs to be supplied to the chemicals before the reaction will start. This is called the activation energy \u2014 it's often provided as heat. Enzymes lower the amount of activation energy that's needed, often making reactions happen at a lower temperature than they could without an enzyme. This speeds up the rate of reaction.When a substrate fits into the enzyme's active site it forms an enzyme-substrate complex \u2014 it's this that lowers the activation energy. Here are two reasons why:1) If two substrate molecules need to be joined, being attached to the enzyme holds them close together, reducing any repulsion between the molecules so they can bond more easily.2) If the enzyme is catalysing a breakdown reaction, fitting into the active site puts a strain on bonds in the substrate, so the substrate molecule breaks up more easily.chemical reaction beginsactivation ener^y_neede_d _ without enzymeenergy is released as the product is formedTime- chemical reaction without enzyme-chemicalreactionwithenzymeThe \u2018L o c k  and K e y \u2019 Model is a Good Start...Enzymes are a bit picky \u2014 they only work with substrates that fit their active site. Early scientists studying the action of enzymes came up with the lock and key' model. This is where the substrate fits into the enzyme in the same way that a key fits into a lock.enzyme is unchanged\ncomplexScientists soon realised that the lock and key model didn't give the full story. The enzyme and substrate do have to fit together in the first place, but new evidence showed that the enzyme-substrate complex changed shape slightly to complete the fit. This locks the substrate even more tightly to the enzyme. Scientists modified the old lock and key model and came up with the 'induced fit' model.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","69":"72Factors Affecting Enzyme ActivityNow you know what enzymes are and how they work, let's take a look at what makes them tick. Humans need things like money and the newest mobile phone, but enzymes are quite content with the right temperature and pH.Temperature has a Big Influence on Enzyme ActivityLike any chemical reaction, the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction increases when the temperature's increased. More heat means more kinetic energy, so molecules move faster. This makes the enzymes more likely to collide with the substrate molecules. The energy of these collisions also increases, which means each collision is more likely to result in a reaction. But, if the temperature gets too high, the reaction stops.1) The rise in temperature makes the enzyme's molecules vibrate more.2) If the temperature goes above a certain level, this vibration breaks some of the bonds that hold the enzyme in shape.3) The active site changes shape and the enzyme and substrate no longer fit together.4) At this point, the enzyme is denatured\u2014 it no longer functions as a catalyst.optimum temperature11 nn 11,TemperaturepH Also Affects Enzyme ActivityO\u2019\" \" I M I | | | ,, , ,~ Every enzyme has an enzyme is r optimum temperature = denatured r For most human enzymes - r ,t,saro^37\u00b0C but some r _ enzymes, like those used in ~- biological washing powders, ~ ~ can work well at 60 \u00b0C ~All enzymes have an optimum pH value. Most human enzymes work best at pH 7 (neutral), but there are exceptions. Pepsin, for example, works best at acidic pH 2, which is useful because it's found in the stomach. Above and below the optimum pH, the H+ and OH ions found in acids and alkalis can mess up the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds that hold the enzyme's tertiary structure in place. This makes the active site change shape, so the enzyme is denatured.Enzyme Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction1) The more enzyme molecules there are in a solution,the more likely a substrate molecule is to collide with one and form an enzyme-substrate complex. So increasing the concentration of the enzyme increases the rate of reaction.2) But, if the amount of substrate is limited, there comes a point when there's more than enough enzyme molecules to deal with all the available substrate, so adding more enzyme has no further effect.steady increase as more active sites are available \\if substrate amount is limited, an increase in enzyme concentration eventually has no further effectEnzyme ConcentrationSubstrate Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction Up to a Pointsteady increase as more substrate molecules are availableall active sites used \u2014 increase in substrate concentration has no further effectSubstrate Concentration1) The higher the substrate concentration, the faster the reaction \u2014 more substrate molecules means a collision between substrate and enzyme is more likely and so more active sites will be used. This is only true up until a 'saturation' point though. After that, there are so many substrate molecules that the enzymes have about as much as they can cope with(all the active sites are full), and adding more makes no difference.2) Substrate concentration decreases with time during a reaction (unless more substrate is added to the reaction mixture), so if no other variables are changed, the rate of reaction will decrease over time too. This makes the initial rate of reaction (the reaction rate at the start) the highest rate of reaction.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","70":"14Enzyme-Controlled ReactionsScience isn't all about words and theory\\ it's also about getting your pipette dirty and making bad smells (in the name of discovery of course).

It's easy to measure the volume of oxygen produced and to work out how fast it's given off. The diagram below shows the apparatus you'll need. The oxygen released displaces the water from the measuring cylinder. (A stand and clamp would also be pretty useful to hold the cylinder upside down, as would a stopwatch and a water bath.)Here's how to carry out the experiment:1)2)3)4)5)6)7)Set up boiling tubes containing the same volume and concentration of hydrogen peroxide.To keep the pH constant, add equal volumes of a suitable buffer solution to each tube.(A buffer solution is able to resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or alkali are added.)Set up the rest of the apparatus as shown in the diagram.Put each boiling tube in a water bath set to aupside down measuring cylindervolume ofdelivery tubeboiling tubehydrogen peroxide solution and catalase enzymeoxygen produced per minute is measuredtrough of <'*== waterdifferent temperature (e.g. 10 \u00b0C, 20 \u00b0C, 30 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C) along with another tube containing catalase (wait 5 minutes before moving onto the next step so the enzyme gets up to temperature).Use a pipette to add (he same volume and concentration of catalase to each boiling tube. Then quickly attach the bung and delivery tube.Record how much oxygen is produced in the first minute (60 s) of the reaction.

The diagram shows how the experiment can be set up. You'll need the apparatus shown in the diagram as well as a stopwatch. A drop of iodine in potassium iodide is put into each well on a spotting tile. A known concentration of amylase and starch are then mixed together in a test tube. A dropping pipette is used to put a drop of this mixture into one of the wells containing the iodine solution on the spotting tile at regular intervals and the resulting colour is observed. The iodine solution goes dark blue-black when starch is present but remains its normal browny-orange colour when there's no starch around. You can see how fast amylase is working by recording how long it takes for the iodine solution to no longer turn blue-black when starch\/amylase mixture is added. Repeat the experiment using different concentrations of amylase. Make sure that you also repeat the experiment three times at each amylase concentration.The experiments above show you how you can investigate the effects of temperature and enzyme concentration on the rate of enzyme-controlled reactions. You can also alter these experiments to investigate the effect of a different variable, such as pH (by adding a buffer solution with a different pH to each test tube) or substrate concentration (you could use serial dilutions to make substrate solutions with different concentrations). The key to experiments like this is to remember to only change one variable \u2014 everything else should stay the same.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","71":"76Topic I B \u2014 More Biological MoleculesDNA and RNAThese two pages are all about nucleic acids \u2014 DNA and RNA.

One of its main functions is to transfer genetic information from the DNA to the ribosomes.

This means that there's genetic continuity between generations of cells (i.e. the cells produced by cell division inherit their genes from their parent cells).1)The enzyme DNA helicase breaks the hydrogen bondsbetween bases on the two polynucleotide DNA strands. This makes the helix unwind to form two single strands.Breaks the hydrogen bonds2)Each original single strand acts as a template for a new strand.

Energy from ATP is released through a hydrolysis reaction (see page 22).Water has a High Latent Heat of Vaporisation1) It takes a lot of energy (heat) to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules.2) So water has a high latent heat of vaporisation \u2014 a lot of energy is used up when water evaporates (vaporises).3) This is useful for living organisms because it means they can use water loss through evaporation to cool down (e.g. humans sweat to cool down) without losing too much water.Topic 1B \u2014 More Biological Molecules\n","74":"22ATPATP is an important molecule in all living things.

Ahh...ATP is the Immediate Source of Energy in a Cell1) Plant and animal cells release energy from glucose \u2014 this process is called respiration.2) A cell can't get its energy directly from glucose.3) So, in respiration, the energy released from glucose is used to make ATP (adenosine triphosphate).4) ATP is made from the nucleotide base adenine, combined with a ribose sugar and three phosphate groups. It's what's known as a nucleotide derivative because it's a modified form of a nucleotide:\n5) Once made, ATP diffuses to the part of the cell that needs energy.6) The energy in ATP is stored in high energy bonds between the phosphate groups. It's released via hydrolysis reactions (see below).ATP is Quickly Made and Used1) When energy is needed by a cell, ATP is broken down into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and P; (inorganic phosphate).2) This is a hydrolysis reaction. A phosphate bond is broken and energy is released.The reaction is catalysed by the enzyme ATP hydrolase.3) ATP hydrolysis can be 'coupled' to other energy-requiring reactions in the cell \u2014 this means the energy released can be used directly to make the coupled reaction happen, rather than being lost as heat.4) The released inorganic phosphate can also be put to use \u2014 it can be added to another compound (this is known as phosphorylation), which often makes the compound more reactive.5) ATP can be re-synthesised in a condensation reaction between ADP and Pr This happens during both respiration and photosynthesis, and is catalysed by the enzyme ATP synthase.________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\u00a9\"'11111 \/1, iADP + P;adenosine diphosphate i.e. it has 2 phosphatesPhosphate groupsCONDENSATION(ENERGY USED)ATP--ATP synthaseadenosine triphosphate i.e. it has 3 phosphatesPhosphate groups\u00a9O\u00a91inorganicphosphateHYDROLYSIS (ENERGY RELEASED)\u00a9' 1 1 1 I 1 I I M 1 I I I I II \\,y- Inorganic phosphate 'r (P) is just the- fancy name for a r- single phosphate. ^\/ 1 1 I I I M I I I I I I | | I ITopic 1B \u2014 More Biological Molecules\n''Hi i n'-\n","75":"23Inorganic IonsInorganic Ions Have an Electric Charge1) An ion is an atom (or group of atoms) that has an electric charge.2) An ion with a positive charge is called a cation.3) An ion with a negative charge is called an anion.4) An inorganic ion is one which doesn't contain carbon (although there are a few exceptions to this rule).5) There are inorganic ions, in solution, in the cytoplasms of cells and in the body fluids of organisms.Each ion has a specific role, depending on its properties.

It helps to protect bacteria from attack by cells of the immune system.The cytoplasm of a prokaryotic cell has no membrane-bound organelles (unlike a eukaryotic cell). It has ribosomes \u2014 but they're smaller than those in a eukaryotic cell.\nPlasmids are small loops of DNAthat aren't part of the main circular DNA molecule. Plasmids contain genes for things like antibiotic resistance, and can be passed between prokaryotes. Plasmids are not always present in prokaryotic cells. Some prokaryotic cells have several.Unlike a eukaryotic cell, a prokaryotic cell doesn't have a nucleus. Instead, the DNA floats free in the cytoplasm. It's circular DNA, present as one long coiled-up strand.It's not attached to any histone proteins (see p. 82).The flagellum (plural flagella) is a long, hair-like structure that rotates to make the prokaryotic cell move. Not all prokaryotes have a flagellum. Some have more than one.Just like in a eukaryotic cell, the plasma membrane is mainly made of lipids and proteins. It controls the movement of substances into and out of the cell.\nTheo went the wrong way about getting practical experience in understanding cell structure.Viruses are Acellular\u2014 They\u2019re Not CellsViruses are just nucleic acids surrounded by protein \u2014 they're not even alive.\u2022 They're even smaller than bacteria \u2014 e.g. HIV is about 0.1 pm across.\u2022 Unlike bacteria, viruses have no plasma membrane, no cytoplasm and no ribosomes.\u2022 All viruses invade and reproduce inside the cells of other organisms.These cells are known as host cells.Viruses contain a core \u00ab e The protein coat aroundof genetic material 1 core is called the capsid.either DNA or RNA.Fi 1C.

This means you can't use an optical microscope to view organelles smaller than 0.2 pm. That includes ribosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes. You may be able to make out mitochondria \u2014 but not in perfect detail. You can also see the nucleus.3) The maximum useful magnification of an optical microscope is about x 1500.1) TEMs use electromagnets to focus a beam of electrons, which is then transmitted through the specimen.2) Denser parts of the spccimcn absorb more electrons, which makes them look darker on the image you end up with.3) TEMs are good because they give high resolution images, so you see the internal structure of organelles like chloroplasts.4) But they can only be used on thin specimens.Electron microscopes ---------------------------------1) They use electrons to form an image.2) They have a higher resolution than optical microscopes so give a more detailed image (and can be used to look at more organelles).3) They have a maximum resolution of about 0.0002 micrometres (|jm).

Stains are used to highlight objects in a cell. For example, eosin is used to make the cytoplasm show up. Iodine in potassium iodide solution (see p. 4) is used to stain starch grains in plant cells.\u2022 Finally, add the cover slip (a square of clear plastic that protects the specimen). To do so, stand the slip upright on the slide, next to the water droplet. Then carefully tilt and lower it so it covers the specimen.Try not to get any air bubbles under there \u2014 they'll obstruct your view of the specimen (see page 35).Topic 2A \u2014 Cell Structure and Division\n","79":"32Cell Division \u2014 MitosisIf it wasn't for cell division, we'd still only be one cell big. If it wasn't for pies, my favourite jeans would still fit.Mitosis is Cell Division that Produces Genetically Identical CellsThere are two types of cell division in eukaryotes \u2014 mitosis and meiosis (see pages 88-89 for more on meiosis).1) In mitosis a parent cell divides to produce two genetically identical daughter cells(they contain an exact copy of the DNA of the parent cell).2) Mitosis is needed for the growth of multicellular organisms (like us) and for repairing damaged tissues.3) In multicellular organisms, not all cells keep their ability to divide (see next page). The ones that do, follow a cell cycle. Mitosis is part of the cell cycle:The cell cycle consists of a period of cell growth and DNA replication called interphase. Mitosis happens after that. Interphase (cell growth) is subdivided into three separate growth stages.These are called G,, S and G,.GAP PHASE 2cell keeps growing and proteins needed for cell division are madeSYNTHESIScell replicates its DNA,ready to divide by mitosisMITOSIS (the cycle starts and ends here)GAP PHASE 1 cell grows and new organelles and proteins are madeMitosis has Four Division StagesMitosis is really one continuous process, but it's described as a series of division stages \u2014 prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. Interphase comes before mitosis in the cell cycle.Interphase \u2014 The cell carries out normal functions, but also prepares to divide. The cell's DNA is unravelled and replicated, to double its genetic content. The organelles are also replicated so it has spare ones, and its ATP content is increased (ATP provides the energy needed for cell division).Prophase \u2014 The chromosomes. condense, getting shorter and fatter. Tiny bundles of protein called centrioles start moving to opposite ends of the cell, forming a network of protein fibres across it called the spindle. The nuclear envelope (the membrane around the nucleus) breaks down and chromosomes lie free in the cytoplasm.Centromere%CentromereAs mitosis begins, the chromosomes are made of two strands joined in the middle by a centromere. One chromatid The separate strands are called chromatids. , , ^There are two strands because chromatids each chromosome has already made an identical copy of itself during interphase.When mitosis is over, the chromatids end up as one-strand chromosomes in the daughter cells.2)3)Metaphase \u2014 The chromosomes (each with two chromatids) line up along the middle of the cell and become attached to the spindle by their centromere.Anaphase \u2014The centromeres divide, separating each pair of sister chromatids. The spindles contract, pulling chromatids to opposite poles (ends) of the spindle, centromere first.This makes the chromatids appear v-shaped.Sister chromatids moving to opposite poles of the spindle4)Telophase \u2014 The chromatids reach the opposite poles on the spindle.They uncoil and become long and thin again. They're now called chromosomes again. A nuclear envelope forms around each group of chromosomes, so there are now two nuclei. The cytoplasm divides (cytokinesis) and there are now two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the original cell and to each other.

Make sure you're wearing safety goggles and a lab coat before you start. You should also wear gloves when using stains.1)2)3)4)5)6) 7)Stained Root Cells8)9)Cut 1 cm from the tip from a growing root (e.g. of an onion). It needs to be the tip because that's where growth occurs (and so that's where mitosis takes place).If you're using ethano-orcein to stain the cells, the tips will also need to be fixed in ethanoic acid.Prepare a boiling tube containing 1 M hydrochloric acid and put it in a water bath at 60 \u00b0C. Transfer the root tip into the boiling tube and incubate for about 5 minutes.Use a pipette to rinse the root tip well with cold water. Leave the tip to dry on a paper towel.Place the root tip on a microscope slide and cut 2 mm from the very tip of it. Get rid of the rest.Use a mounted needle to break the tip open and spread the cells out thinly.Add a few drops of stain and leave it for a few minutes.The stain will make the chromosomes easier to see under a Telophase microscope. There are loads of different stains, all with crazy names (toluidine blue O, ethano-orcein, Feulgen stain...If you're using the beulgen stain, you'll need an extra rinse.Place a cover slip over the cells and push down firmly to squash the tissue. This will make the tissue thinner and allow light to pass through it. Don't smear the cover slip sideways (or you'll damage the chromosomes).Now you can look at all the stages of mitosis under an optical microscope (see below).

A plant root tip is constantly growing, so you'd expect a high mitotic index (i.e. lots of cells in mitosis). In other tissue samples, a high mitotic index could mean that tissue repair is taking place or that there is cancerous growth in the tissue.Topic 2 A \u2014 Cell Structure and Division\n","81":"36Topic 2B \u2014 Cell MembranesCell Membrane StructureYou might remember a bit about cell membranes from p. 25. Well now it's time to delve a little deeper...Membranes Control What Passes Through ThemAll cells are surrounded by membranes. In eukaryotic cells,many of the organelles are surrounded by membranes too.1)2)Cell-surface membranes surround cells. They are a barrier between the cell and its environment, controlling which substances enter and leave the cell. They're partially permeable \u2014 they let some molecules through but not others. Substances can move across the cell-surface membrane by diffusion, osmosis or active transport (see pages 38-43).The membranes around organelles divide the cell into different compartments \u2014 they act as a barrier between the organelle and the cytoplasm. They are also partially permeable and control what substances enter and leave the organelle.Cell Membranes have a Fluid Mosaic\u2019 StructurePartially permeable membranes can be useful at sea.The basic structure of all cell membranes is pretty much the same. They're composed of lipids (mainly phospholipids \u2014 see page 7), proteins and carbohydrates (attached to proteins or lipids).1)2)3)4)5)In 1972, the fluid mosaic model was suggested to describe the arrangement of molecules in the membrane.

They bind to the cholesterolhydrophobic tails of the phospholipids, causing them to pack more closely together.This restricts the movement of the phospholipids, making the membrane less fluid and more rigid.Cholesterol helps to maintain the shape of animal cells (which don't have cell walls). This is particularly important for cells that aren't supported by other cells, e.g. red blood cells, which float free in the blood.Topic 2B \u2014 Cell Membranes\n","82":"38Exchange Across Cell Membranes \u2014 DiffusionOoooh it's starting to get a bit more exciting... here's how some substances can get across cell membranes without using energy, just what you've always wanted to know, I bet.Diffusion is the Passive Movement of Particles1) Diffusion is the net movement of particles (molecules or ions) from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.2) Molecules will diffuse both ways, but the net movement will be to the area of lower concentration. This continues until particles are evenly distributed throughout the liquid or gas.3) The concentration gradient is the path from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Particles diffuse down a concentration gradient4) Diffusion is a passive process \u2014 no energy is needed for it to happen.5) Particles can diffuse across cell membranes, as long as they can move freely through the membrane.111' h 1 I I I  I  I IF! , M,,,, (\/Polar molecules have Z ~ Partlal positive and negative ~ charges (see p. 20).

They're also non-polar, which makes them soluble in lipids, so they can dissolve in the hydrophobic bilayer.6) When molecules diffuse directly through a cell membrane, it's also known as simple diffusion.Facilitated Diffusion uses Carrier Proteins and Protein Channels1) Some larger molecules (e.g. amino acids, glucose) would diffuse extremely slowly through the phospholipid bilayer because they're so big.2) Charged particles, e.g. ions and polar molecules, would also diffuse slowly \u2014 that'sbecause they're water soluble, and the centre of the bilayer is hydrophobic (see page 36).3) So to speed things up, large or charged particles diffuse through carrier proteins or channel proteins in the membrane instead \u2014 this is called facilitated diffusion.4) Like diffusion, facilitated diffusion moves particles down a concentration gradient, from a higher to a lower concentration.5) It's also a passive process \u2014 it doesn't use energy.'fiAndy needed all his concentration for this particular gradient...Carrier proteins move large molecules across membranes, down their concentration gradient.

The process is pretty similar to facilitated diffusion (see p. 38) \u2014 a molecule attaches to the carrier protein, the protein changes shape and this moves the molecule across the membrane, releasing it on the other side.There are two main differences between active transport and facilitated diffusion though:1) Active transport usually moves solutes from a low to a high concentration\u2014 in facilitated diffusion, they always move from a high to a low concentration.2) Active transport requires energy \u2014 facilitated diffusion does not.\u2022 ATP is a common source of energy in the cell.

Infectious diseases can be really nasty, but luckily there's an army of cells in the body that helps lo protect us \u2014 the immune system.Foreign Antigens Trigger an Immune ResponseAntigens are molecules (usually proteins) that can generate an immune response when clctected by the body.They arc usually found on the surface of cells and are used by the immune system to identify: pathogens (organisms that cause disease), abnormal body cells (e.g. cancerous or pathogen-infected cells, which have abnormal antigens on their surface), toxins and cells from other individuals of the same species (e.g. organ transplants).There are four main stages in the immune response:(T) Phagocytes Engulf PathogensA phagocyte (e.g. a macrophage) is a type of white blood cell that carries out phagocytosis (engulfment of pathogens). They're found in the blood and in tissues and are the first cells to respond to an immune system trigger inside the body. Here's how they work:1) A phagocyte recognises the foreign antigens on a pathogen.2) The cytoplasm of the phagocyte moves round the pathogen, engulfing it.3) The pathogen is now contained in a phagocytic vacuole (a bubble) in the cytoplasm of the phagocyte.4) A lysosome (an organelle that contain enzymes called lysozymes) fuses with the phagocytic vacuole. The lysozymes break down the pathogen.5) The phagocyte then presents the pathogen's antigens \u2014 it sticks the antigens on its surface to activate other immune system cells.nucleuscytoplasmlysosomeantigens on surface ofphagocyte engulfs the pathogenlysosome fuses with phagocytic vacuole(2) Phagocytes Activate T-cellsA T-cell {also called a T-lymphocyte) is another type of white blood cell. It has receptor proteins on its surface that bind to complementary antigens presented to it by phagocytes. This activates the T-cell. Different types of T-cells respond in different ways. For example, helper T-cells {TH cells) release chemical signals that activate and stimulate phagocytes and cytotoxic T-cells (Tc cells), which kill abnormal and foreign cells B-cells, which secrete antibodies (see below).Th cells also activate(3) T-cells Activate B-cells, Which Divide into Plasma CellsB-cells (also called B-lymphocytes) are also a type of white blood cell. They're covered with antibodies \u2014 proteins that bind antigens to form an antigen-antibody complex. Each B-cell has a different shaped antibody on its membrane, so different ones bind to different shaped antigens.1) When the antibody on the surface of a B-cell meets a complementary shaped antigen, it binds to it.2) This, together with substances released from helper T-cells, activates the B-cell. This process is called clonal selection.3) The activated B-cell divides into plasma cells.(V) Plasma Cells Make More Antibodies to a Specific AntigenPlasma cells are identical to the B-cell (they're clones). They secrete loads of antibodies specific to the antigen. These are called monoclonal antibodies. They bind to the antigens on the surface of the pathogen to form lots of antigen-antibody complexes,An antibody has two binding sites, so can bind to two pathogens at the same time. This means that pathogens become clumped together \u2014 this is called agglutination. Phagocytes then bind to the antibodies and phagocytose many pathogens at once. This process leads to the destruction of pathogens carrying this antigen in the body.variableregions(orange)constan regions (blue)heavychainAntibodies are proteins \u2014 they're made up of chains of amino acids.The specificity of an antibody depends on its variable regions, which form the antigen binding sites. Each antibody has a variable region with a unique tertiary structure {due to different amino acid sequences) that's complementary to one specific antigen. All antibodies have the same constant regions.Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","86":"46Immunity and VaccinesThe primary response gives us immunity against a disease, but only after you've become infected. If only there was a way to stimulate memory cell production without getting the disease... well, there is \u2014 vaccination.Vaccines can Protect Individuals and Populations Against Disease1) While your B-cells are busy dividing to build up their numbers to deal with a pathogen (i.e. the primary response \u2014 see previous page), you suffer from the disease. Vaccination can help avoid this.2) Vaccines contain antigens that cause your body to produce memory cells against a particular pathogen, without the pathogen causing disease. This means you become immune without getting any symptoms.3) Vaccines protect individuals that have them and, because they reduce the occurrence of the disease, those not vaccinated are also less likely to catch the disease (because there are fewer people to catch it from). This is called herd immunity.4) Vaccines always contain antigens \u2014 these may be free or attached to a dead or attenuated (weakened) pathogen.5) Vaccines may be injected or taken orally. The disadvantages of taking a vaccine orally are that it could be broken down by enzymes in the gut or the molecules of the vaccine may be too large to be absorbed into the blood.6) Sometimes booster vaccines are given later on (e.g. after several years) to make sure that memory cells are produced.Antigenic Variation Helps Some Pathogens Evade the Immune System1) Antigens on the surface of pathogens activate the primary response.2) When you're infected a second time with the same pathogen (which has the same antigens on its surface) they activate the secondary response and you don't get ill.3) However, some sneaky pathogens can change their surface antigens. This antigen variability is called antigenic variation. (Different antigens are formed due to changes in the genes of a pathogen.)4) This means that when you're infected for a second time, the memory cells produced from the first infection will not recognise the different antigens. So the immune system has to start from scratch and carry out a primary response against these new antigens.5) This primary response takes time to get rid of the infection, which is why you get ill again.6) Antigenic variation also makes it difficult to develop vaccines against some pathogens for the same reason. Examples of pathogens that show antigenic variation include HIV and the influenza virus.7) Here's how antigenic variation affects the production of vaccines to help prevent people catching influenza:1) The influenza (flu) vaccine changes every year. That's because the antigens on the surface of the influenza virus change regularly, forming new strains of the virus.2) Memory cells produced from vaccination with one strain of the flu will not recognise other strains with different antigens. The strains are immunologically distinct.3) Every year there are different strains of the influenza virus circulating in the population, so a different vaccine has to be made.4) New vaccines are developed and one is chosen every year that is the most effective against the recently circulating influenza viruses.5) Governments and health authorities then implement a programme of vaccination using the most suitable vaccine.1st infection\n2nd infectiondifferent antigensThe oral vaccine was proving hard to swallow.\nTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","87":"48Antibodies in MedicineAntibodies aren't only great for fighting off infection, they're also excellent tools for use in medical diagnosis and drug development. Let's all give three cheers for antibodies. Without them, we'd all probably be dead by now.Monoclonal Antibodies can be used to Target Specific Substances or Cells1) Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies produced from a single group of genetically identical B-cells(plasma cells). This means that they're all identical in structure.2) As you know, antibodies are very specific because their binding sites have a unique tertiary structure (see p.44) that only one particular antigen will fit into (one with a complementary shape).3) You can make monoclonal antibodies that bind to anything you want, e.g. a cell antigen or other substance, and they will only bind to (target) this molecule.EXAMPLE: Targeting drugs to a particular cell type \u2014 cancer cells1) Different cells in the body have different surface antigens.2) Cancer cells have antigens called tumour markers that are not found on normal body cells.3) Monoclonal antibodies can be made that will bind to the tumour markers.4) You can also attach anti-cancer drugs to the antibodies.5) When the antibodies come into contact with the canccr cells they will bind to the tumour markers.6) This means the drug will only accumulate in the body where there are cancer cells.7) So, the side effects of an antibody-based drug are lower than other drugs because they accumulate near specific cells.monoclonalantibodyantigen binding siteanti-cancer drugdrug attached to antibodyantibody binds to tumour markers on cancer cellcell-surface antigen\/\\----------------------------No0No------------------------------------------------------------\u2014L\nnormal body cell tumour marker cancer cellEXAMPLE: Targeting a particular substance for medical diagnosis \u2014 pregnancy testingPregnancy tests detect the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) that's found in the urine of pregnant women:1) The application area contains antibodies for hCG bound to a coloured bead (blue).2) When urine is applied to the application area any hCG will bind to the antibody on the beads, forming an antigen-antibody complex.3) The urine moves up the stick to the test strip, carrying any beads with it.4) The test strip contains antibodies to hCG that are stuck in place (immobilised).5) If there is hCG present the test strip turns blue because the immobilised antibody binds to any hCG \u2014 concentrating the hCG-antibody complex with the blue beads attached.If no hCG is present, the beads will pass through the test area without binding to anything, and so it won't go blue.coloured bead antibody \u00a9 ^ to hCGhCG\nappflow of liquidIimmobilised antibody to hCGication areatest stripTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","88":"50Interpreting Vaccine and Antibody DataIf someone claims anything about a vaccine or antibody, the claim has to be validated (confirmed) before it's accepted. To do this, you need to evaluate the data used to support the claim and the methodology behind it.New Knowledge About Vaccines and Antibodies is Validated by ScientistsWhen a study presents evidence for a new theory (e.g. a vaccine has a dangerous side effect) it's important that other scientists come up with more evidence to validate (confirm) the theory. Other scientists may repeat the study and try to reproduce the results, or conduct other studies to try to prove the same theory.EXAMPLE 1: The MMR Vaccine1) In 1998, a study was published about the safety of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.The study was based on 12 children with autism (a life-long developmental disability) and concluded that there may be a link between the MMR vaccine and autism.2) Not everyone was convinced by this study because it had a very small sample size of 12 children, which increased the likelihood of the results being due to chance. The study may have been biased because one of the scientists was helping to gain evidence for a lawsuit against the MMR vaccine manufacturer. Also, studies carried out by different scientists found no link between autism and the MMR vaccine.3) There have been further scientific studies to sort out the conflicting evidence. In 2005, a Japanese study was published about the incidence of autism in Yokohama (an area of Japan). They looked at the medical records of 30 000 children born between 1988 and 1996 and counted the number of children that developed autism before the age of seven. The MMR jab was first introduced in Japan in 1989 andwas stopped in 1993. During this time the MMR vaccine was administered to children at 12 months old. The graph shows the results of the study.4) In the exam you could be asked to evaluate evidence like this.\u2022 You might be asked to describe the data...The graph shows that the number of children diagnosed with autism continued to rise after the MMR vaccine was stopped. For example, from all the children born in 1992, who did receive the MMR jab, about 60 out of 10 000 were diagnosed with autism before the age of seven. However, from all the children born in 1994, who did not receive the MMR jab, about 160 out of 10 000 of them were diagnosed with autism before the age of seven.\u2022 ...or draw conclusions There is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\u2022 ... or evaluate the methodology You can be much more confident in this study, compared to the 1998 study, because the sample size was so large \u2014 30 000 children were studied. A larger sample size means that the results are less likely to be due to chance.EXAMPLE 2: Herceptin\u00ae\u2014 Monoclonal AntibodiesAbout 20% of women with breast cancer have tumours that produce more than the usual amount of a receptor called HER2. Herceptin1 is a drug used to treat this type of breast cancer \u2014 it contains monoclonal antibodies that bind the HER2 receptor on a tumour cell and prevent the cells from growing and dividing.In 2005, a study tested Herceptin\u00ae on women who had already undergone chemotherapy for HER2-type breast cancer. 1694 women took the drug for a year after chemotherapy and another 1694 women were observed for the same time (the control group). The results are shown in the graph on the right.Describe the data: Almost twice as many women in the control groupdeveloped breast cancer again or died compared to the group taking Herceptin\u00ae.Draw conclusions: A one-year treatment with Herceptin\u00ae, after chemotherapy, increases the disease-free survival rate for women with HER2-type breast cancer.250\nHerceptin* * Control Group of womenYear of birth 19-I ' 1 \/ I I I \/ II I u I I ( I l \\ l I | l I I\/\/ \u00a3 Have a look at pages 213-214 r for more about drawing : conclusions and evaluating. :''i 1111111 n 1111 n 11 \/i \\ 11111 \\\\N\nTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n","89":"52HIV and VirusesViruses aren't cells like bacteria. They're not even living things \u2014 they can only reproduce inside the cells of another organism (called the host). All viruses cause disease, and you need to know all about one particularly nasty blighter...HIV is the Virus That Causes AIDS1) HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that affects the immune system.It eventually leads to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).2) AIDS is a condition where the immune system deteriorates and eventually fails. This makes someone with AIDS more vulnerable to other infections, like pneumonia (see next page).3) HIV infects (and eventually kills) helperT-cells, which act as the host cells (see p. 28) for the virus. Remember, helper T-cells send chemical signals that activate phagocytes, cytotoxic T-cells and B-cells (see p. 44) so they're hugely important cells in the immune response. Without enough helper T-cells, the immune system is unable to mount an effective response to infections because other immune system cells don't behave how they should.4) People infected with HIV develop AIDS when the helper T-cell numbers in their body reach a critically low level.HIV has a Spherical StructureYou might get asked about the structure of HIV in your exam1) A core that contains the genetic material (RNA) and some proteins (including the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is needed for virus replication).2) An outer coating of protein called a capsid.3) An extra outer layer called an envelope. This is made of membrane stolen from the cell membrane of a previous host cell.4) Sticking out from the envelope are loads of copies of an attachment protein that help HIV attach to thehost helper T-cell.HIV Replicates Inside its Host\u2019s Helper T-CellsHIV (and all other viruses) can only reproduce inside the cells of the organism it has infected. HIV replicates inside the helper T-cells of the host. It doesn't have the equipment (such as enzymes and ribosomes) to replicate on its own, so it uses those of the host cell.Here's how HIV replicates:1) The attachment protein attaches to a receptor molecule on the cell membrane of the host helper T-cell.2) The capsid is released into the cell, where it uncoats and releases the genetic material (RNA) into the cell's cytoplasm.3) Inside the cell, reverse transcriptase is used to make a complementary strand of DNA from the viral RNA template (see p. 16-17 for more on DNA and RNA).4) From this, double-stranded DNA is made and inserted into the human DNA.5) Host cell enzymes are used to make viral proteins from theviral DNA found within the human DNA.6) The viral proteins are assembled into new viruses, which bud from the cell and go on to infect other cells.During the initial infection period, HIV replicates rapidly and the infected person may experience severe flu-likesymptoms. After this period, HIV replication drops to a lower level. This is the latency period. During the latency period (which can last for years), the infected person won't experience any symptoms.Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\u00a9HIVhelper T cellDNA\u00a9\u00aev \u201c \u201c  DAttachment protein CapsidS1 , \" \"........................u-n,,,,,._ ttachnient proteins can also -EnvelopeGeneticmaterialReverse transcriptase\n","90":"54Topic 3A \u2014 Exchange and Transport SystemsSize and Surface AreaExchanging things with the environment is pretty easy if you're a single-celled organism, but if you're multicellular it all gets a bit more complicated... and it's all down to this 'surface area to volume ratio' malarkey.Organisms Need to Exchange Substances with their EnvironmentEvery organism, whatever its size, needs to exchange things with its environment.Otherwise there'd be no such thing as poop scoops...1) Cells need to take in oxygen (for aerobic respiration) and nutrients.2) They also need to excrete waste products like carbon dioxide and urea.3) Most organisms need to stay at roughly the same temperature, Raj was g|ac| he'd exchangedSO heat needs to be exchanged too. his canoe for a bigger boat.How easy the exchange of substances is depends on the organism's surface area to volume ratio.Smaller Animals have Higher Surface Area : Volume RatiosA mouse has a bigger surface area relative to its volume than a hippo.

The diffusion rate is quick because of the small distances the substances have to travel (see p. 39).2) In multicellular animals, diffusion across the outer membrane is too slow, for two reasons:\u2022 Some cells are deep within the body \u2014 there's a big distance between them and the outside environment.\u2022 Larger animals have a low surface area to volume ratio \u2014 it's difficult to exchange enough substances to supply a large volume of animal through a relatively small outer surface.So rather than using straightforward diffusion to absorb and excrete substances, multicellular animals need specialised exchange organs (like lungs \u2014 see p. 58).They also need an efficient system to carry substances to and from their individual cells \u2014 this is mass transport.In mammals, 'mass transport' normally refers to the circulatory system (see p. 70), which uses blood to carry glucose and oxygen around the body. It also carries hormones, antibodies (p. 44) and waste like CO,.Mass transport in plants involves the transport of water and solutes in the xylem and phloem (see pages 78 and 80).Topic 3 A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","91":"56Gas ExchangeLots of organisms have developed adaptations to improve their rate of gas exchange. It's a tricky business if you're an insect or a plant though \u2014 you've got to exchange enough gas but avoid losing all your water and drying to a crisp...Gas Exchange Surfaces have Two Major AdaptationsMost gas exchange surfaces have two things in common:1) They have a large surface area.2) They're thin (often just one layer of epithelial cells)\u2014 this provides a short diffusion pathway across the gas exchange surfaceThe organism also maintains a steep concentration gradient of gases across the exchange surface.All these features increase the rate of diffusion \u2014see page 39.Single-celled Organisms Exchange Gases across their Body Surface1) Single-celled organisms absorb and release gases by diffusion through their outer surface.2) They have a relatively large surface area, a thin surface and a short diffusion pathway (oxygen can take part in biochemical reactions as soon as it diffuses into the cell)\u2014 so there's no need for a gas exchange system.Fish Use a Counter-Current System for Gas ExchangeThere's a lower concentration of oxygen in water than in air. So fish have special adaptations to get enough of it.1) Water, containing oxygen, enters the fish through its mouth and passes out through the gills.2) Each gill is made of lots of thin plates called gill filaments, which give a big surface area for exchange of gases.3) The gill filaments are covered in lots of tiny structures called artcry ___^ \/(plural = lamellae)lamellae, which increase the surface area even more.4) The lamellae have lots of blood capillaries and a thin surface layer of cells to speed up diffusion.artery (deoxygenated blood to gill)artery (oxygenated blood from the gill)lamella\nblood leaves lamella with high oxygen conc.Water flowing towards the lamella (relatively high oxygen conc.'blood enters lamella with low oxygen conc.Water flowing away from the lamella (relatively low oxygen conc.)gill filaments5) Blood flows through the lamellae in one direction and water flows over in the opposite direction. This is called a counter-current system. It maintains a large concentration gradient between the water and the blood.

You need to know the structure of the lungs as well as how they're ventilated... take a deep breath...Lungs are Specialised Organs for Gas ExchangeHumans need to get oxygen into the blood (for respiration) and they need to get rid of carbon dioxide (made by respiring cells). This is where breathing (or ventilation as it's sometimes called) and the gas exchange system comes in.Human Gas Exchange Systemintercostal muscles bronchusbronchiole alveoli1) As you breathe in, air enters the trachea (windpipe).2) The trachea splits into two bronchi \u2014 one bronchus leading to each lung.3) Each bronchus then branches off into smaller tubes called bronchioles.4) The bronchioles end in small 'air sacs' called alveoli (this is where gases are exchanged \u2014 see next page).5) The ribcage, intercostal muscles and diaphragm all work together to move air in and out (see below).si 111 n 111 u i w 111 m i \\ \/111 u ii i u 111111111 11111 m i 11 w n 111111\/ ~ There are actually three layers of intercostal muscles.

This can make it more difficult to breathe and reduce the rate of gas exchange.Measures of Lung Function Can Help to Diagnose Lung DiseasesLung diseases affect both ventilation (breathing) and gas exchange in the lungs \u2014 in other words, how well the lungs function. Doctors can carry out tests to investigate lung function and diagnose a lung disease. You might be asked to interpret results from tests like these in your exams. Here are some terms you might come across:1) Tidal volume is the volume of air in each breath \u2014 usually between 0.4 dm* and 0.5 dm* for adults.2) Ventilation rate is the number of breaths per minute. For a healthy person at rest it's about 15 breaths.3) Forced expiratory volumet (FEV1) is the maximum volume of air that can be breathed out in 1 second.4) Forced vital capacity (FVC) is the maximum volume of air it is possible to sV\\n m u n m i m ibreathe forcefully out of the lungs after a really deep breath in. \u201c stan s \u00b0r. z0\/1 - decimetres cubed, -X 1 dm3 is the same -You can figure out tidal volume, ventilation rate and other measures of breathing from the graph produced from a spirometer (a fancy machine that scientists and doctors use to measure the volume of air breathed in and out):9. as a litre. :\nMeasuring tidal volume is one of the hardest jobs in the world.Different Diseases Affect the Lungs in Different WaysHere are some examples of different lung diseases and how they affect breathing.Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB)1) When someone becomes infected with tuberculosis bacteria, immune system cells build a wall around the bacteria in the lungs. This forms small, hard lumps known as tubercles.2) Infected tissue within the tubercles dies and the gaseous exchange surface is damaged, so tidal volume is decreased.3) Tuberculosis also causes fibrosis (see below), which further reduces the tidal volume.4) A reduced tidal volume means less air can be inhaled with each breath. In order to take in enough oxygen, patients have to breathe faster, i.e. ventilation rate is increased.5) Common symptoms include a persistent cough, coughing up blood and mucus, chest pains, shortness of breath and fatigue.Fibrosis1) Fibrosis is the formation of scar tissue in the lungs.This can be the result of an infection or exposure to substances like asbestos or dust.2) Scar tissue is thicker and less elastic than normal lung tissue.3) This means that the lungs are less able to expand and so can't hold as much air as normal \u2014 tidal volume is reduced, and so is FVC (i.e. a smaller volume of air can be forcefully breathed out).4) There's a reduction in the rate of gaseous exchange \u2014 diffusion is slower across a thicker scarred membrane.5) Symptoms of fibrosis include shortness of breath, a dry cough, chest pain, fatigue and weakness.6) Fibrosis sufferers have a faster ventilation rate than normal \u2014 to get enough air into their lungs to oxygenate their blood.Topic 3A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","94":"62Interpreting Lung Disease DataIt's very possible that you could be asked to interpret some data on lung disease in the exam. So being my usual nice sell I've given you some examples to show you how to do it. I know it looks a bit dull but believe me, it'll really help.You Need to be Able to Interpret Data on Risk Factors and Lung Disease1) All diseases have factors that will increase a person's chance of getting that disease. These are called risk factors. For example, it's widely known that if you smoke you're more likely to get lung cancer (smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer).2) This is an example of a correlation \u2014 a link between two things (see page 213). However, a correlation doesn't always mean that one thing causes the other. Smokers have an increased risk of getting cancer but that doesn't necessarily mean smoking causes the disease \u2014 there are lots of other factors to take into consideration.3) You need to be able to describe and analyse data given to you in your exams.Here's an example of the sort of thing you might get:EXAMPLE 1 \u2014 SMOKING AND LUNG CANCER\nCcQ nsO5040O-C d5 Uun T5302010Percentage of males aged 16 and over who smoked manufactured cigarettes in Great Britain\u2022\/vYear\u0000ip No) cv nrooooo120iAge-standardised mortality rates for male lung cancer in the United Kingdom1003 CX- o80604020Year of deaths<0 kOYou might be asked to:1) Describe the data \u2014 The graph on the left shows that the number of adult males in Great Britain who smoke decreased between 1990 and 2012. The graph on the right shows that the male lung cancer mortality (death) rate decreased between 1990 and 2012 in the United Kingdom.2) Draw conclusions \u2014You need to be careful what you say here. There's a correlation (link) between the number of males who smoked and the mortality rate for male lung cancer. But you can't say that one caused the other. There could be other reasons for the trend, e.g. deaths due to lung cancer may have decreased because less asbestos was being used in homes (not because fewer people were smoking).Other points to consider \u2014 The graph on the right shows mortality (death) rates. The rate of cases of lung cancer may have been increasing but medical advances may mean more people were surviving (so only mortality was decreasing).You might also need to evaluate the way in which scientific data has led to government restrictions on the sources of risk factors. E.g.Responses to dataMedical studies in 1950s and 1960s documented the link between smoking and various forms of cancer, particularly lung cancer. The evidence prompted the first voluntary agreement between the UK government and tobacco companies in 1971, which stated that tobacco products and adverts should carry a health warning label. As of October 2008, picture health warnings were made compulsory on all UK boxes of cigarettes after studies suggested they were more effective than written warnings alone.Topic 3A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","95":"64Dissecting Gas Exchange SystemsAfter learning all about how different organisms are adapted for efficient gas exchange, you might be wondering what those structures really look like. Well, here are some lovely dissections that you might do. How exciting.You Need to be Able to Carry Out Dissections1) As part of your AS or A level in Biology, you're expected to carry out at least one dissection. It could be a dissection of a gaseous exchange system or a mass transport system (or an organ within one of those systems) in either an animal or a plant. You could also be asked about dissections in your exams.2) There's an example of a plant dissection that you could do on page 79.These two pages cover some animal dissections that you could do as well or instead.3) Whether it's a plant or animal dissection, you're expected to know how to carry it out safely and ethically.

You should be able to see the trachea and two bronchi going into the lungs.To see the lungs inflate, attach a piece of rubber tubing to the trachea and pump air into the lungs using a foot or bicycle pump. The lungs will deflate by themselves because of the elastin in the walls of the alveoli (see p. 61).Never blow down the tube to inflate the lungs \u2014 you could end up sucking up stale air from irside the lungs into your mouth.Pop the lungs in a clear plastic bag before you start to stop bacteria inside the lungs from being released into the room.Once you've seen the lungs inflate, you can examine the different tissue types in the lungs.The trachea is supported by C-shaped rings of cartilage. smooth muscleA cross-section of the trachea looks like this:C-shapedcartilageII I | I 1 \\ I I I M I III I I ' I M 1\/- If you do cut the - Z. cartilage be careful \u2014 you -- need to wear goggles to rprotect your eyes.\/| i \\ i H n 111 w M 111 M i7)8) 9)Cartilage is tough, so if you want to open up the trachea, it's best to cut it lengthways, down the gap in the C-shaped rings.

You should be able to see the bronchioles branching off.Cut off a piece of the lung.

That's why it's important to wash your hands after the dissection and disinfect work surfaces.Here\u2019s How to Dissect Fish Gills in Bony Fish1) Again, make sure you're wearing an apron or lab coat.2) Place your chosen fish (something like a perch or salmon works well) in a dissection tray or on a cutting board.3) Gills are located on either side of the fish's head. They're protected on eachside by a bony flap called an operculum and supported by gill arches.4) To remove the gills, push back the operculum and use scissors to carefully remove the gills. Cut each gill arch through the bone at the top and bottom. They should look a bit like this:5) If you look closely, you should be able to see the gill filaments.N\\\/1 I II I i \/1 I I II I M I I II I II 11 u u 111 i ii I I II I M II I i u I II I II II n I I I I I I I I I 11^- For more nformation about the structure and function of fish gills, see page 56. - 1 w n 11 H ' i u 11 h 11 h 11111111 m i m i m 111 m 111 ii m i w i m 11 m w n ^A single gill archoperculum (the gills are under here)\ngill filamentsTopic 3 A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","96":"66 Topic 3BMore Exchange and Transport SystemsDigestion and AbsorptionThe whole point of digestion is to break down the food you eat into small molecules that your cells can absorb. As you might imagine, this involves loads of different chemical reactions and our old friends, enzymes.Food is Broken Down into Smaller Molecules During Digestion1) The large biological molecules (e.g. starch, proteins) in food are too big to cross cell membranes.This means they can't be absorbed from the gut into the blood.2) During digestion, these large molecules are broken down into smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, amino acids), which can move across cell membranes. This means they can be easily absorbed from the gut into the blood, to be transported around the body for use by the body cells.3) You might remember from Topic 1 A, that most large biological molecules are polymers, which can be broken down into smaller molecules (monomers) using hydrolysis reactions.Hydrolysis reactions break bonds by adding water.4) During hydrolysis, carbohydrates are broken down into disaccharides and then monosaccharides.Fats are broken down into fatty acids and monoglycerides. Proteins are broken down into amino acids.Digestive Enzymes are Used to Break Down Biological Molecules in Food1) A variety of different digestive enzymes are produced by specialised cells in the digestive systems of mammals. These enzymes are then released into the gut to mix with food.2) Since enzymes only work with specific substrates (see page 11), different enzymes are needed to catalyse the breakdown of different food molecules.Carbohydrates are Broken Down by Amylase and Membrane-Bound Disaccharidases1) Amylase is a digestive enzyme that catalyses the conversion of starch (a polysaccharide) into the smaller sugar maltose (a disaccharide). This involves the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds in starch.2) Amylase is produced by the salivary glands (which release amylase into the mouth) and also by the pancreas (which releases amylase into the small intestine).3) Membrane-bound disaccharidases are enzymes that are attached to the cell membranes of epithelial cellslining the ileum (the final part of the small intestine). They help to break down disaccharides (e.g. maltose, sucrose and lactose) into monosaccharides (e.g. glucose, fructose and galactose). Again, this involves the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds.<v\\u i \" i J1111111111 \/ I i, l I I I 11111,~ There s more on polysaccharides, tl ~ disaccharides and monosaccharides \u2014- on pages 2-5. \"\/> 111111' 11 n w i \/ it 1111111111 n4) Monosaccharides can be transported across the cell membranes of the ileum epithelial cells via specific transporter proteins (see next page).DisaccharideDisaccharidaseMonosaccharide Productsmaltosemaltaseglucose + glucosesucrosesucraseglucose + fructoselactoselactaseglucose + galactoseLipids are Broken Down by Lipase (with the Help of Bile Salts)1) Lipase enzymes catalyse the breakdown of lipids into monoglycerides and fatty acids. This involves the hydrolysis of the ester bonds in lipids.2) Lipases are made in the pancreas. They work in the small intestine.3) Bile salts are produced by the liver and emulsify lipids \u2014 this means they cause the lipids to form small droplets.4) Bile salts are really important in the process of lipid digestion. Several small lipid droplets have a bigger surface area than a single large droplet (for the same volume of lipid). So the formation of small droplets greatly increases the surface area of lipid that's available for lipases to work on.\u00a3 monoglyceride is a C- glycerol molecule with \u00a3 ~ one fatty acid attached =\nemulsificationbile saltsbiglipid dropletA \/V,\/ lipase digestion\u00b0o\u00b0of lipidsmall lipid dropletsmonoglycerides & fatty acids \u00b00\u00b0\u00b00 micelles5) Once the lipid has been broken down, the monoglycerides and fatty acids stick with the bile salts to form tiny structures called micelles.Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n","97":"Who is this book for?\nTh e  t h i r d  e d i t i o n  o f  t h i s  b o o k  a c c u r a t e l y  a n d  c o m p r e h e n s i v e l y  \nfollows the new Cambridge International AS and A Level \nBusiness syllabus (9609). \nIf you are a student studying this syllabus, or a \nteacher of the syllabus, you can be con fi dent that the \nbook provides complete coverage of the course to \nthe appropriate level.

However, no student of Business can \nhope to make much progress in the study of this subject \nunless they have a good understanding of the economic \nenvironment in which a business operates. Business activity \ndoes not take place in isolation from what is going on \naround it. Th e very structure and health of the economy \nwill have a great impact on how successful business activity \nis. Th e central purpose of this whole unit, \u2018Business and \nits environment\u2019, is to introduce the inter-relationships \nbetween businesses, the world in which they operate and the \nlimits that governments impose on business activity. Th i s  \nfi rst chapter explains the nature of business activity and the \nrole of enterprise in setting up and developing businesses.\nThe purpose of business activity\nA business is any organisation that uses resources to \nmeet the needs of customers by providing a product or \nservice that they demand. Th ere are several stages in the \nproduction of fi nished goods. Business activity at all stages \ninvolves creating and adding value to resources, such \nas raw materials and semi- fi nished goods, and making \nthem more desirable to \u00a0\u2013 and thus valued by \u00a0\u2013 the fi nal \npurchaser. Without business activity, we would all still be \nentirely dependent on the goods that we could make or \ngrow ourselves \u00a0\u2013 as some people in virtually undiscovered \nnative communities still are. Business activity uses the \nscarce resources of our planet to produce goods and \nservices that allow us all to enjoy a very much higher \nstandard of living than would be possible if we remained \nentirely self-su ffi  cient.On completing this chapter, you will be able to:\n\u25a0 understand what business activity involves\n\u25a0 recognise that making choices as a result of the \n\u2018economic problem\u2019 always results in opportunity cost\n\u25a0 analyse the meaning and importance of creating value\n\u25a0 recognise the key characteristics of successful \nentrepreneurs\u25a0 assess the importance of enterprise and entrepreneurs \nto a country\u2019s economy\n\u25a0 understand the meaning of social enterprise and the \ndiff erence between this and other businesses.\n3","100":"This chapter cover syllabus \nsection AS Level 1.2.\nDULIP\u2019S BUSINESS IS A SUCCESS\nDulip\u2019s business had been operating successfully for \ntwo years when he decided to expand.

This \nwill allow me to add value to the natural products that \nI\u00a0produce,\u2019 he explained to his family.\nDulip realised that he would need much more \ncapital to build a furniture-making factory.

Th e role of \nentrepreneurs and the main characteristics of successful \nentrepreneurs were also studied. Building on this \nknowledge, this chapter focuses on the di ff erent types \nof business structures that exist and the di ff erent ways \nof classifying business activity. Th e importance of the \nlegal structure used by a business is examined and \nthese di ff erent forms are examined and evaluated.

Th ese are \nsome of the important issues to be covered in this chapter.\nLocal, national and international businesses\nLocal businesses operate in a small and well-de fi ned part \nof the country. Th ey do not have expansion as an objective \nand make no attempt to expand to obtain customers across \nthe whole country. Typical examples are small building \nand carpentry fi rms, single-branch shops, hairdressing \nbusinesses and child-minding services.\nNational businesses have branches or operations \nacross \u00a0most of the country. Th ey make no attempt to establish \noperations in other countries. Good examples include large \ncar-retailing fi rms, retail shops with many branches selling \ngoods in just one country, and national banking fi rms.\nInternational businesses operate in more than one \ncountry. Th ese are o ft en called multinational businesses.\nNature and scope of international \ntrading \u00a0links\nAll countries, to a greater or lesser degree, engage in \ninternational trade with other countries. Th is is true no \nmatter which economic system is in place. Th e growth \nof world trade in recent years has been very rapid. In \naddition, the huge expansion in trade between certain \ncountries, for example China with the USA and the EU, \nhas had a great impact on their economic development.\nBy trading together, countries can build up improved \npolitical and social links and this can help to resolve \ndiff erences between them.

Th is form \nof growth can lead to rapid expansion, which might be \nvital in a competitive and expanding market. However, it \noft en leads to management problems.

When the Spanish \ncommunications business Telefonica engaged in anti-\ncompetitive agreements with Portugal Telecom it \nwas fined a massive \u20ac67 million fine by the European \nCompetition Commissioner. The EU reported that: \u2018The \nEU is committed to a genuine free and single market \nin telecommunications. Anti-competitive practices \nthat raise prices and limit consumer choice will not be \ntolerated.\u2019\nIn contrast, Nokia has always o ff ered workers who \nare made redundant payments and deals in excess \nof the \u00a0legal minimum. When the Finnish company \nannounced the closure of its Bochum factory in \nGermany with the loss of 2,300 jobs, it reached an \nagreement with the workers\u2019 trade union leaders \nin which Nokia paid US$314 million in redundancy \npay. It also set up a social plan for employees to help \nthem \u00a0look for other jobs. These arrangements were \nmore than the legal EU requirement. For example, the EU law states that redundant workers should be paid \n1.5 weeks\u2019 salary for each year worked. Nokia\u2019s policy \nshowed that it was trying to set a good example and \nattempting to limit the bad publicity in Germany \nfrom \u00a0the factory closure. Several years later, when \nNokia closed the Salo factory in Finland, because of \nfalling demand, the Finnish trade unions demanded \nthe same deal as o ff ered to the German workers \nwho lost their jobs.

It has su ff ered \nfrom rapid inflation over this period but the annual rate \nis now 5.2% (2013). However, this is still higher than \nall developed economies. Partly as a consequence of \nthe global financial crisis and the negative impact on \nIcelandic banks, the country has huge foreign debts and \ngovernment borrowing is high.\nThe exchange rate value of the Icelandic krona has \nfallen by 50% compared to the euro in recent years. As \nIceland has to import most of the goods and materials it \nneeds \u00a0\u2013 its two main resources are fish and geothermal \nenergy \u00a0\u2013 this has made inflation even worse.\nRecent economic growth has helped to keep \nunemployment low by international standards. It is now \n4% of the working population. Wage demands from \nworkers could rise as they realise that employers cannot \neasily find replacement employees.\nThe Icelandic government is determined to bring \ndown inflation and high interest rates are part of this policy. These may encourage foreign speculators to \nleave their money invested in Icelandic banks and \nstop the krona exchange rate from falling further. \nAs with most economic developments, there is both \nbad news and good news for Icelandic businesses. \nHigh interest rates are bad news for firms like Baugur, \nwhich have borrowed very heavily to invest \u00a0in \nUK retail companies.

The owners recruited a qualified managing \ndirector to give new leadership. Jerry Xue did not take \nlong to make changes. He aimed to raise the annual \nsales revenue from $1 million to $4 million in two years \nby specialising in fashion sunglasses. New designs were \ndeveloped. Jerry\u2019s contacts within the industry helped \nhim gain big orders from some of the leading retailers. \nThe sunglasses sold for high prices. These large orders \nwere profitable but there was a big problem: the biggest \nfirms were the slowest payers. The big retailers expected \nseveral months of credit. They also demanded such high \nstandards that some production had to be scrapped.\nJerry started to worry about the firm\u2019s cash position. \nSuppliers were demanding payment. The bank overdra ft  \nhad reached record levels. Overtime working by sta ff  to \ncomplete orders on time took cash out of the business. \nThen Jerry discovered that his bookkeeper had not \nincluded tax or transport costs in the monthly cash-flow forecast \u00a0\u2013 the business had even less money than he \nthought.\nFriday the 13th was a bad day for Jerry.

It has now reached a crossroads \nin its development as the energy market it operates in is \nbecoming saturated and ceasing to grow. The directors \nare considering four growth strategies a ft er u ndertaki n g \nan extensive strategic analysis.

The consultants had attempted \nthis, but also reported that, as some of the options were \nriskier than others, the forecasts were likely to be open \nto a wide margin of error.

Explain your answer.\n\u25a0 Explain why a bad strategic choice could put the future of \nthe whole business at risk.39 Strategic choice\nIntroducing the topic\nIntroduction\nStrategic choice is the next logical element in the strategic \ndecision-making process. Choice is at the centre of \nstrategy formulation. If there are no important choices to \nbe made, there is no point in giving much consideration \nto the decision-making process at all. Strategic choice is \nconcerned with the identi fi cation of di ff erent strategic \noptions and deciding between them. Good strategic \nchoices have to be challenging enough to gain competitive \nadvantage, but also achievable and within the resource \ncapabilities of the organisation. Th ere are logical \ntechniques available to assist managers in making strategic \nchoices, but judgement and skill are also very important.On completing this chapter, you will be able to:\n\u25a0 understand the importance of strategic choice\n\u25a0 analyse strategic choices, using the Anso ff  matrix \nmodel, and evaluate its usefulness\n\u25a0 analyse strategic choices using force-field analysis and \nevaluate its usefulness\u25a0 apply the decision tree technique to strategic choices \nin di ff erent business contexts and evaluate its \nusefulness.\nAnso ff \u2019 s  m a t r i x\nTh is analytical tool is one of the most widely used means \nof portraying alternative corporate growth strategies.\nAnso ff \u2019 s  m a t r i x :  a model used to show the degree of \nrisk associated with the four growth strategies of market \npenetration, market development, product development \nand diversification.\nKEY TERM\nAnso ff  popularised the idea that long-term business \nsuccess was dependent upon establishing business 556","143":"This chapter covers syllabus \nsection A Level 6.4.\nIntroducing the topic\nMANAGING BUSINESS CHANGE\nConstant change is a business reality, and \norganisations must continually adapt to \ntheir environments to stay competitive \nor risk becoming obsolete. That is why \nthe ability to incorporate big changes \ninto the \u00a0culture of a business while still \nachieving good operating results is a \nmuch-sought-a ft er competency. Five key \nquestions are helpful in determining the \nlikelihood that a major business change \nwill succeed or fail:\n1 H o w  i s  t h e  n e w  v i s i o n  d i ff erent, better \nand more compelling?\n2 Are the business leaders personally \ncommitted to the change?\n3 Does the organisation have the resources to make \nthe change?\n4 H o w  i n g r a i n e d  i s  t h e  c u r r e n t  c u l t u r e ?\n5 Will the employees accept that change is necessary?\nOrganisations that fail to manage change e ff ectively \noft en experience internal disputes and increased \ncosts. Consider Lu ft hansa Airlines; since it announced \nthe details of an aggressive cost-cutting programme \nin February 2012, the airline has not demonstrated \nthe skill or culture to execute its plan e ff ectively . \nAlienated employees have taken part in ongoing \nstrikes that have inconvenienced customers and \nincreased costs.What organisations get the thumbs up on \ntheir ability to change? Based on these five key \nquestions, Cisco Systems, Citrix Systems and eBay \nare some companies that have reacted well. Citrix, a \nmultinational so ft ware business, is building a change-\nmanagement system in which leaders\u2019 and team \nmembers\u2019 confidence and ability to lead change are \nincreased by real-world case studies, coaching and \nemployee-designed workspaces.\nAs the pace of change continues to increase, \nan organisation\u2019s change capability will become a \ngreater requirement for sustainable performance. The \norganisations that are investing in these capabilities \nare more likely to benefit from future opportunities.By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n\u25a0 understand what strategic implementation means\n\u25a0 evaluate the importance of business plans and \ncorporate planning to strategic implementation\n\u25a0 analyse di ff erent types of corporate culture and \nassess the impact culture can have on strategic \nimplementation\u25a0 understand how businesses can establish a \u2018change \nculture\u2019\n\u25a0 assess how businesses can manage and control \nstrategic change\n\u25a0 evaluate the importance of contingency planning and \ncrisis management.Strategic \nimplementation40\nFigure 40.1 Organisational changeWhere are we going?\nWhat are our products, markets,\nDifferentiators, and priorities?STRATEGY\nPROCESSES\nPEOPLEAre we delivering on the\nstrategy in the most\neffective and ef ficient way?\nHow can we focus, develop,\nand gain the commitment of\nour people?568","144":"41Preparing for your \nexaminations\nOn completing this chapter, you will be able to:\n\u25a0 understand the key di ff erences between the two \nCambridge International Examinations AS Level \nexamination papers 1 and 2\n\u25a0 understand the di ff erences between these two AS \npapers and the Cambridge A Level paper\n\u25a0 appreciate what you need to do to revise e ff ectively\n\u25a0 understand what the \u2018assessment objectives\u2019 are and \nhow you can demonstrate these clearly.\nIntroduction\nYou can help yourself greatly in preparing for your \nfi nal examinations by following some important steps. \nNo one likes examinations but there is no need to be \nafraid of them if you prepare yourself well and apply \nstraightforward examination techniques.

Th e key concepts in Business are:\nChange  \u2013 is the only constant in business. New enterprises are \noft en cre at ed i n response t o ec onomic, cul tural or t echnol ogical \nchanges. Existing businesses must adapt to change if they are \nto survive and grow.\nManagement  \u2013 is relevant to every person in a business.

As Dulip is concerned \nabout his environment country\u2019s, he will plant two new \ntrees for each one he cuts down. He has been planning \nthis business venture for some time.

Much of this book is concerned with \nhow these decisions are made, the information needed to \nmake them and the techniques that can assist managers in \nthis important task. However, no student of Business can \nhope to make much progress in the study of this subject \nunless they have a good understanding of the economic \nenvironment in which a business operates. Business activity \ndoes not take place in isolation from what is going on \naround it. Th e very structure and health of the economy \nwill have a great impact on how successful business activity \nis. Th e central purpose of this whole unit, \u2018Business and \nits environment\u2019, is to introduce the inter-relationships \nbetween businesses, the world in which they operate and the \nlimits that governments impose on business activity. Th i s  \nfi rst chapter explains the nature of business activity and the \nrole of enterprise in setting up and developing businesses.\nThe purpose of business activity\nA business is any organisation that uses resources to \nmeet the needs of customers by providing a product or \nservice that they demand. Th ere are several stages in the \nproduction of fi nished goods. Business activity at all stages \ninvolves creating and adding value to resources, such \nas raw materials and semi- fi nished goods, and making \nthem more desirable to \u00a0\u2013 and thus valued by \u00a0\u2013 the fi nal \npurchaser. Without business activity, we would all still be \nentirely dependent on the goods that we could make or \ngrow ourselves \u00a0\u2013 as some people in virtually undiscovered \nnative communities still are. Business activity uses the \nscarce resources of our planet to produce goods and \nservices that allow us all to enjoy a very much higher \nstandard of living than would be possible if we remained \nentirely self-su ffi  cient.On completing this chapter, you will be able to:\n\u25a0 understand what business activity involves\n\u25a0 recognise that making choices as a result of the \n\u2018economic problem\u2019 always results in opportunity cost\n\u25a0 analyse the meaning and importance of creating value\n\u25a0 recognise the key characteristics of successful \nentrepreneurs\u25a0 assess the importance of enterprise and entrepreneurs \nto a country\u2019s economy\n\u25a0 understand the meaning of social enterprise and the \ndiff erence between this and other businesses.\n3","154":"This chapter cover syllabus \nsection AS Level 1.2.\nDULIP\u2019S BUSINESS IS A SUCCESS\nDulip\u2019s business had been operating successfully for \ntwo years when he decided to expand.

This \nwill allow me to add value to the natural products that \nI\u00a0produce,\u2019 he explained to his family.\nDulip realised that he would need much more \ncapital to build a furniture-making factory.

South \nAfrica has also become a key supplier of motor-industry \ncomponents, providing everything from windscreens to \nexhaust pipes for some of the most demanding markets \nin the world. The most impressive success story lies with \nthe production of catalytic converters. With massive \nplatinum and palladium deposits, South Africa has \nemerged from nowhere to take nearly 10% of the world\u2019s \nproduction of the anti-pollution components, which is \nset to increase to 25% by the end of the decade. This did \nnot happen by accident. It is the result of a deliberate \nstrategy by the government to draw the world\u2019s best \ncar manufacturers into South Africa, and drag the \ndomestic industry from behind protectionist barriers \ninto the highly competitive global market for cars and \ncomponents.\n\u2018When we started, the South African auto industry \nwas basically in ruins,\u2019 said Antony Black, an economist \nat Cape Town University, and one of the architects of the \ngovernment\u2019s Motor Industry Development Programme \n(MIDP). \u2018Domestic production could not even compete \nwith imports, which faced duties in excess of 115%,\u2019 \nhe added. Launched in 1995, MIDP sought to kick-start \nSouth Africa\u2019s ailing motor industry by attracting the \nworld\u2019s big car-makers with many financial incentives. \nThe new factories have had the benefit of generating \nthousands of new jobs, while at the same time forcing \nhundreds of small and medium-sized local suppliers to \nimprove quality and productivity or face extinction.\nThe strategy has succeeded in getting some of \nthe world\u2019s biggest companies to invest huge sums in \nSouth Africa. Exports of fully built cars have increased \nto some R5 billion, and are expected to double within \ntwo years. At the same time, exports of components \nhave trebled to R12 billion. German car manufacturers, \ntraditionally strong in South Africa, have been the first to \ntake advantage of MIDP\u2019s export credits and investment allowances, although Italian and French companies \nsuch as Fiat and Renault are rapidly following. Daimler-\nChrysler has just announced that it is switching its entire \nproduction of right-hand-drive C-Class Mercedes-Benz \ncars from Bremen in Germany to the Eastern Cape in \nan investment project worth R1.3 billion, which will \ncreate 800 new jobs at the plant and 3,000 new jobs in \nthe supply industry.

If the \nview is that they will or are, then the Commission \nmakes proposals for the O ffi  ce of Fair Trading (OFT) \nto take action. For example, the OFT can prevent a \nmerger or takeover from taking place or can insist that \nunfair monopoly practices are stopped. However, if the \nCommission does not fi nd signi fi cant evidence that \nthe public interest will be harmed, then the merger or \nmonopoly continues without further action being \ntaken. Th is is unlike the monopoly policy in some \ncountries, such as the USA, where the courts have \nthe legal right to break up a monopoly or to prevent a \nmerger whether or not there is evidence of existing or \nresulting negative public interest. In the USA this is \ncalled \u2018trust busting\u2019.\nHow do monopolies develop?\nMonopolies are developed by:\n\u25a0 invention of new products or processes that are then legally \npatented to give the originator a monopoly in production \n(although this reduces potential competition, patents are \ndesigned to encourage inventors and designers to develop \noriginal product ideas)\n\u25a0 merging or taking over other firms in the industry\n\u25a0 l e g a l  p r o t e c t i o n \u00a0\u2013 for example, a government may choose \nto protect its country\u2019s postal service by giving it a legal \nmonopoly for the delivery of letters\n\u25a0 the existence of \u2018barriers to entry\u2019 into an industry, \nsuch as advanced technical knowledge, huge costs of \nbuilding facilities or buying equipment, or the need to \nadvertise extensively to get established \u00a0\u2013 these barriers \nwill prevent, or make very di ff icult, the start-up of \nnew \u00a0competitors.\nHow are consumers a ff ected by monopolies?\nTh ere can be both positive and negative e ff ects. Possible \nbene fi ts include:\n\u25a0 lower prices if large-scale production by a monopolist \nreduces average costs of production\n\u25a0 increased expenditure on new products and technical \nadvances as the monopolist will be able to protect their \nposition and make monopoly profits from the new idea.\nHowever, the drawbacks include:\n\u25a0 higher prices if the monopolist has so little competition \nthat consumers have no option but to buy from this \none firm\n\u25a0 l i m i t e d  c h o i c e  o f  p r o d u c t s\n\u25a0 less investment in new products as a result of complacency \nand little risk of competition\u25a0 no incentive for the firm to lower costs and improve \neff i c i en cy .\nUncompetitive \u00a0\u2013 or restrictive \u00a0\u2013 practices\nTh e s e  p r a c t i c e s  a r e  a t t e m p t s  b y  fi rms \u00a0\u2013 oft en acting \nor\u00a0colluding together \u00a0\u2013 to interfere with free market \nforces and so limit choice for customers or drive up \nprices. When fi rms act together they operate as if they \nare one monopoly. Identifying and acting against \nthese practices is an important part of a government\u2019s \ncompetition policy. Examples of such restrictive \npractices include:\n1 Refusal to supply a retailer if they do not agree to \ncharge the prices determined by the manufacturer:  \nKeeping prices high is clearly a disadvantage for the \nconsumer, yet manufacturers can argue that it is an \nessential part of their branding of the product and \nhelps to pay for extensive advertising and product \ndevelopment.\n2 Full-line forcing: This is when a major producer \nforces a retailer to stock the whole range of products \nfrom the manufacturer \u00a0\u2013 not just the really popular \nones. If the retailer refuses, then even the popular \nitems will not be supplied any longer.\n3 Market sharing agreements and price-fixing \nagreements:  This form of collusion involves forming a \ncartel between the firms concerned. They agree to fix \nprices and divide the market between them and not to \ncompete for new business \u00a0\u2013 they will agree to share \nnew business or new contracts out around the group \nso that they do not compete with each other to drive \nprices down.\n4 Predatory pricing:  When a major firm in an industry \ntries to block new competitors by charging very low \nprices for certain goods, then this is called predatory \npricing. As the new business is unlikely to have the low \ncosts enjoyed by a large, established business, the firm \nmay find it very di ff icult to survive this extreme form of \ncompetition.\nIn most countries governments have passed competition \nlaws that make all of these anti-competitive practices \nillegal.\nTOP TIP\nWhen evaluating the impact of laws on business \ndecisions and activity, do not forget that they can \npresent opportunities as well as constraints. \nMeeting all legal obligations \u00a0\u2013 and even exceeding \ntheir requirements \u00a0\u2013 can create such a good public \nimage that a business can use this as a major \nmarketing tool.\n82Cambridge International AS and A Level Business","161":"How is inflation measured?\nTh e  U K  i s  t y p i c a l  i n  u s i n g  a  c o n s u m e r  p r i c e  i n d e x  ( C P I )  \nto measure annual in fl ation.

Lower levels of \njob security can mean that safety needs, as identi fi ed by \nMaslow, may not be satis fi ed and this will have a negative \neff ect on motivation. Temporary contracts can be either \nfull-time or part-time. Th ey are contracts for fi xed periods \nof time as opposed to permanent contracts. Permanent \ncontracts end only when a worker is sacked (for example \nfor poor discipline), made redundant (for example when \ndemand has fallen) or leaves of their own accord. Th e \nadvantages and drawbacks of temporary contracts are \nsimilar to those of part-time contracts, especially the \nbene fi t of fl exibility o ff ered to employers.

In \ndoing this, operations managers must be concerned with:\n\u25a0 eff iciency of production  \u2212 keeping costs as low as possible \nwill help to give competitive advantage\n\u25a0 quality  \u2212 the good or service must be suitable for the \npurpose intended\n\u25a0 flexibility and innovation  \u2212 the need to develop and \nadapt to new processes and new products is increasingly \nimportant in today\u2019s dynamic business environment.Essentially, operations managers are aiming to produce \ngoods and services of the required quality, in the \nrequired quantity, at the time needed, in the most cost-\neff ective way.\nThe production \u2013 or transformation \u2013 \nprocess\nIn all businesses at all stages of production, the production \nprocess is basically the same. \u2018Inputs\u2019 are converted or \ntransformed into \u2018outputs\u2019 and this is sometimes called \nthe \u2018transformation\u2019 process. Th is can be simply illustrated \n(see Figure 22.1 ).On completing this chapter, you will be able to:\n\u25a0 understand what is meant by operations \nmanagement\n\u25a0 appreciate the nature of the production process and \nhow value can be added\u25a0 understand the di ff erence between production and \nproductivity, e ff iciency and e ff ectiveness\n\u25a0 evaluate the di ff erent advantages and limitations of \nlabour intensity and capital intensity.\n331","178":"of the major additional issues that need to be weighed up \ncarefully before going o ff shore.\n1 Language and other communication barriers\nDistance is o ft en a problem for e ff ective communication \u2013 \nfor example, direct face-to-face contact is less likely. Th i s  \nproblem is made worse when some operations are abroad \nand when company employees, suppliers or customers use \na diff erent language altogether. Th is is one of the reasons \nfor India\u2019s success in attracting o ff shoring companies \u2013 \nEnglish is one of the o ffi  cial languages.\n2 Cultural di ff e r e n c e s\nTh ese are important for the marketing department if \nproducts are being sold in the country concerned \u2013 \nconsumer tastes and religious factors will play a signi fi cant \nrole in determining what goods should be stocked. Cultural \ndiff erences also exist in the workplace. Toyota found that \nthe typical Mexican worker is self-reliant and independent, \nyet the Toyota manufacturing system depends greatly on \nteamwork and cooperation. E ff ective sta ff  training may be \nnecessary to ensure that cultural di ff erences do not prevent \nsuccessful overseas expansion.\nExample:  Oscar Rodriguez was only 20 when he was \nemployed by Toyota\u2019s new Tijuana factory. \u2018I was self-\nreliant and I would conceal production problems and \ntry and fi x them myself, \u2019 he said. \u2018But I was taught how \nto communicate and I have learned that there is never a \nstupid question. Th e company supervisors teach us well \nand they are patient\u2019 .\n3 Level-of-service concerns\nTh is applies particularly to the o ff shoring of call \ncentres, technical support centres and functions such as \naccounting. Some consumer groups argue that o ff shoring \nof these services has led to inferior customer service due to \ntime-di ff erence problems, time delays in phone messages, \nlanguage barriers and di ff erent practices and conventions, \ne.g. with accounting systems.\n4 Supply-chain concerns\nTh ere may be some loss of control over quality and \nreliability of delivery with overseas manufacturing \nplants. Th is reason is always cited by Zara, the clothing \ncompany, for their decision not to o ff shore clothing \nproduction to cheaper countries, as \u2018fast fashion\u2019 requires \nvery close contact with suppliers. Using \u2018just-in-time\u2019 \nmanufacturing may become much riskier if important \nsupplies have to be shipped thousands of miles to an \nassembly plant.5 Ethical considerations\nThere may be a loss of jobs when a company locates all \nor some of its operations abroad and this may, as in the \ncase of Burberry clothing, lead to a consumer boycott \nas there were claims that the company\u2019s decision to \nclose its Welsh factory was not \u2018the right thing to do\u2019. \nIn addition, there are several reports of high-street \nclothing retailers sourcing supplies from Asian factories \nthat use child labour and very low-wage labour. Could \nthis negative publicity cancel out the competitive \nadvantage of low-cost supplies? This important \nconsideration is just another reason why the important \nlocation decisions should be taken at the highest \nmanagement level.\nTOP TIP\nRemember that the lowest-cost location may not always \nbe the optimal location \u2013 if quality su ff ers or if there is \nnegative public reaction to products being made by low-\npaid workers then low costs may be outweighed by even \nlower revenue.\nScale of operation\nTh ere is a huge di ff erence between the scale of operations  \nof a small business \u2013 perhaps operated by just one \nperson \u00a0\u2013 and the largest companies in the world. Some \nof the latter have total annual sales exceeding the GDP of \nsmall countries. In 2013, ExxonMobil recorded sales of \nmore than US$482 billion, yet the GDP of Th a i l a n d ,  f o r  \nexample, was US$365 billion.\nIs it right to sell clothing in European shops that has been \nmade by low-wage labour in Asian countries?\n35523: Operations planning ","179":"This chapter covers syllabus \nsection AS Level 4.3.\nTHE SHOCKING COST OF HOLDING INVENTORIES\nIt is commonly accepted that the cost to a business \nof holding inventories is between 4% and 10% of the \nvalue of the inventory goods.

The experience of a \nlarge Scottish supermarket group suggests that it is \npossible to move away from holding large inventories \n\u2018just in case\u2019 there is a demand for the products. In \nplace of this approach, the managers of Scotmid \ndecided on an IT-driven inventory-ordering system \nthat reordered goods from suppliers automatically \nas remaining goods on the shelves were purchased \nby customers. \u2018We now have much tighter control of \ninventory, wastage and improved cash flow.

Choice is at the centre of \nstrategy formulation. If there are no important choices to \nbe made, there is no point in giving much consideration \nto the decision-making process at all. Strategic choice is \nconcerned with the identi fi cation of di ff erent strategic \noptions and deciding between them. Good strategic \nchoices have to be challenging enough to gain competitive \nadvantage, but also achievable and within the resource \ncapabilities of the organisation. Th ere are logical \ntechniques available to assist managers in making strategic \nchoices, but judgement and skill are also very important.On completing this chapter, you will be able to:\n\u25a0 understand the importance of strategic choice\n\u25a0 analyse strategic choices, using the Anso ff  matrix \nmodel, and evaluate its usefulness\n\u25a0 analyse strategic choices using force-field analysis and \nevaluate its usefulness\u25a0 apply the decision tree technique to strategic choices \nin di ff erent business contexts and evaluate its \nusefulness.\nAnso ff \u2019 s  m a t r i x\nTh is analytical tool is one of the most widely used means \nof portraying alternative corporate growth strategies.\nAnso ff \u2019 s  m a t r i x :  a model used to show the degree of \nrisk associated with the four growth strategies of market \npenetration, market development, product development \nand diversification.\nKEY TERM\nAnso ff  popularised the idea that long-term business \nsuccess was dependent upon establishing business 556","197":"This chapter covers syllabus \nsection A Level 6.4.\nIntroducing the topic\nMANAGING BUSINESS CHANGE\nConstant change is a business reality, and \norganisations must continually adapt to \ntheir environments to stay competitive \nor risk becoming obsolete. That is why \nthe ability to incorporate big changes \ninto the \u00a0culture of a business while still \nachieving good operating results is a \nmuch-sought-a ft er competency.

Everyone knows this. Yet the jerboa, a small rodent found throughout Asia and \nNorthern Africa, may never drink water in its life. The jerboa (family Dipodidae) is found in both hot and cold deserts from the Sahara Desert to the Gobi Desert. It is extremely well adapted for dry desert environments and gets the water it needs from the food it eats. This includes plant leaves, roots and seeds, and in some cases insects. Jerboas also produce tiny amounts of very concentrated urine to get rid of their waste products, another adaptation for saving the water needed for life.\nBiology is the study of living things. The basic unit of life is the cell, but underpinning all life is chemistry. The way \natoms are bonded together affects the way chemicals work in the cells \u2013 and that affects everything, from the way plants make food by photosynthesis to the way your eyes respond to light.\nIn this chapter, you will be looking at some of the important ways in which atoms and molecules interact to \nmake up the chemistry of life. You will be using these basic principles throughout your biology course because they are fundamental to the structures and functions of all the organisms you will study.\nYou will see how the chemistry of water enables life to survive and chemical reactions to continue. You will look \nat carbohydrates, from the simplest sugars to the most complex polysaccharides. These molecules have a wide variety of uses in organisms, from the fuel for cellular respiration to the main structural material in plants. As you discover how the molecules are joined together, you will recognise the relationships between the structure of the molecules and their functions in the body. \nThe same links between structure and function are clear when you look at the structure of lipid molecules. For \nexample, lipids are used as energy stores in both animals and plants. Lipids are non-polar molecules but you will discover how they can become polar in combination with other inorganic groups such as phosphates. This polarity has great importance for the characteristics of the cell membrane.\nAt the end of this chapter, you will study the structure of proteins. They are long chains of amino acids that are \nheld together by chemical bonds to make complex structures. The bonds include the covalent bonds, ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds. \nMATHS SKILLS FOR THIS CHAPTER\n \u2022Recognise and make appropriate use of units in calculations  (e.g. millimetres)\n \u2022Use ratios, fractions and percentages\n (e.g. representing the relationships between atoms in an ion or molecule)\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

The dragonfly \nand the plant it is resting on in fig A are all made of  chemicals. So is the cow in fig C \u2013 and it needs the chemical known as salt which it is licking to stay alive. If  you understand some of  the basic principles of  chemistry, you will develop a much better understanding of  biological systems. The chemical bonds within and between molecules affect the properties of  the compounds they form. This affects their functions within the cell and the organism. For example, if  you want to understand the chemistry of  water, you need to understand chemical bonds and how dipoles are created within molecules. \n\u25b2 fig A  All life depends on some v ery fundamental chemistry.\nThe basic unit of  all elements is the atom. When the atoms of  two or more different elements react, they form a compound. An atom is made up of  a nucleus containing positive protons and neutral neutrons. The nucleus is surrounded by negative electrons. We can show this in a model as electrons orbiting around the nucleus in shells. When an atom has a full outer shell of  electrons, it is stable and does not react. However, most atoms do not have a full outer shell of  electrons. In chemical reactions, these electrons are involved in changes that give the atom a stable outer shell. There are two ways they can achieve this.\n \u2022Ionic bonding:\n the atoms involved in the reaction give or receive electrons. One atom, or part of  \nthe molecule, gains one or more electrons and becomes an anion (a negative ion). The other atom, \nor part of  the molecule, loses one or more electrons and becomes a cation (a positive ion). Strong \nforces of  attraction called ionic bonds hold the oppositely charged ions together (see fig B).\nCl 1\n(2,8,7)\nchlorine atomNaKey\n   or    r epresents\na single electr on\n(2,8,1)\nsodium atomNa\n(2,8)\nsodium ionCl\n(2,8,8)\nchloride ion11\n22\n\u25b2 fig B  T he formation of sodium chloride (salt), an inorganic substance that is very important in living organisms, is \nan example of ionic bonding.1.1\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Biological molecules are often organic compounds. Organic compounds all contain carbon atoms. They also contain atoms of  hydrogen, oxygen and, less frequently, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus. Most of  the material in your body that is not water consists of  these organic molecules. An understanding of  why organic molecules are special will help you to understand the chemistry of  biological molecules including carbohydrates, lipids and proteins.\nEach carbon atom can make four bonds and so it can connect \nto four other atoms. Carbon atoms bond particularly strongly to other carbon atoms to make long chains. The four bonds of  a carbon atom usually form a tetrahedral shape. This means carbon compounds can be rings, branched chains or any number of  three-dimensional (3D) shapes (see fig A). In some carbon compounds small molecules (monomers) bond with many other similar units to make a very large molecule called a polymer. The ability of  carbon to combine and make macromolecules (large molecules) is the basis of  all biological molecules and provides the great variety and complexity found in living things.\nThese two bonds\nare in the plane\nof the paper.\nor more often as:C This bond goesback behind the\nplane of the paper.\nThis bond sticks out ofthe plane of the paper.\ncan be shown with corners representing carbons, and itshydrogens ignored:\nH\nCC\nHHCC\nHH\nHH\nHHC\nHC\nHHCC\nC\nHHC\nHHHH HH\nThis part \nof a chain molecule:\n\u25b2 fig A  T he bonds in a carbon atom have a complicated 3D shape.

They are also important for storing energy and they form an important part of  the cell wall in plants, fungi and bacteria. Sugars and starch are the best known carbohydrates. Sucrose is the familiar white crystalline table sugar; glucose is used as a fuel by the cells of  our bodies. Starch is in rice, flour and potatoes. But the group of  substances called carbohydrates contains many more compounds, as you will discover.\n\u25b2 fig B  Carbohydr ates are important molecules in both plants and animals \n\u2013 and carbohydrate foods like this bread play a major role in the human \ndiet.\nThe basic structure of  all carbohydrates is the same. They consist \nof  carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. There are three main groups of  carbohydrates: monosaccharides, disaccharides and \npolysaccharides. Some have more complex molecules than others (see Section 1A.3).\nMONOSACCHARIDES: THE SIMPLE SUGARS \nMonosaccharides are simple sugars in which there is one oxygen \natom and two hydrogen atoms for each carbon atom in the molecule. A general formula for this can be written (CH\n2O)n. Here \nn can be any number, but it is usually low.\nTriose sugars (n = 3) have three carbon atoms and the general \nformula C3H6O3. They are important in mitochondria, where the \nrespiration process breaks down glucose into triose sugars (see Book 2 Chapter 7A).1A1.4 CP1 1.3 1.2(ii) 1.2(i)\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

They are made of  many monosaccharide units \njoined by condensation reactions that create glycosidic bonds (see Section\u00a01A.2 fig E). Polysaccharides \ndo not have the sweet taste of  many mono- and disaccharides, but these complex polymers include some very important biological molecules.\nMolecules with between 3 and 10 sugar units are known as oligosaccharides, while molecules \ncontaining 11 or more monosaccharides are known as true polysaccharides. The glycosidic bonds in the polysaccharide can be broken to release monosaccharide units for cellular respiration.\nThe glycosidic bond between two glucose units is split by a process known as hydrolysis (see fig\u00a0A).  \nThe hydrolysis reaction is the opposite of  the condensation reaction that created the molecule, so water \nis added to the bond. Starch and glycogen are gradually broken down into shorter and shorter chains and eventually single sugars are left. Disaccharides break down to form two monosaccharides. Hydrolysis takes place during digestion in the gut, and also in the muscle and liver cells when the carbohydrate stores are broken down to release sugars for use in cellular respiration (see Book 2 Chapter 7A).\nH\nHOH\nOHO\n1 46\n2 35\n1,4-glycosidic bondH\nHO OHH O\n1 4\n2 356\nH\nHOH O\n1 4\n2 356H\nOOHH O\n1 4\n2 356\nmaltosecondensation hydrolysis\nH2O H2O\u03b1-glucose \u03b1-glucose\n\u25b2 fig A  Gly cosidic bonds are made by condensation reactions and broken down by hydrolysis.\nCARBOHYDRATES AND ENERGY \nMONOSACCHARIDES AND DISACCHARIDES\nEvery chemical reaction taking place in a cell needs energy. This energy is supplied by a substance \ncalled adenosine triphosphate, ATP . This ATP comes from the breakdown of  the monosaccharide \nglucose, using oxygen, in the process of  cellular respiration. Y ou will learn much more about cellular respiration later in your course in Book 2 Chapter 7A. \nThe arrangement of  atoms in a molecule of  \u03b1-glucose means that it can be broken down completely \nin a series of  reactions, if  oxygen is available. The compounds that are produced, called the end products, are waste carbon dioxide and water, and lots of  ATP . This supplies the energy needed for all the reactions in the cell. LEARNING TIP\nGlycosidic bonds are formed \nwith the removal of a molecule of water in condensation reactions. \nGlycosidic bonds are broken \nwith the addition of a molecule of water in hydrolysis reactions.\nEXAM HINT\nBe careful not to say that this produces or creates energy for cell processes. Energy cannot be created \u2013 it is converted from one form to another. Here, chemical energy is transferred from the glucose molecule to the ATP molecules.LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n \u25fcKnow the diff erence between monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides, including glycogen and starch.\n \u25fcExplain how monosaccharides join to f\norm polysaccharides through condensation reactions forming glycosidic \nbonds, and how these can be split through hydrolysis reactions.\n \u25fcR\nelate the structures of monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides to their roles in providing and  \nstoring energy.1.4 CP1 1.3 1.2(ii) 1.2(i)\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

They are an \nintegral part of  all cell membranes and are also used as an energy store. Lipids contain many carbon\u2013\nhydrogen bonds and almost no oxygen. When lipids are oxidised in the respiration process, the bonds are broken and carbon dioxide and water are the final products. This reaction can be used to drive the production of  much ATP (see Sections 1A.3, 2A.2 and 2A.4 and Book 2 Chapter 5A). Lipids, \nespecially triglycerides, store about three times as much energy as the same mass of  carbohydrates. Many plants and animals convert spare food into oils or fats as an energy store to use when needed. For example, the seeds of  plants contain lipids to provide energy for the seedling when it starts to grow, which is why seeds are such an important food source for many animals.\nFATS AND OILS\nFats and oils are important groups of  lipids. Chemically they are very similar, but fats such as butter are solids at room temperature whereas oils such as olive oil are liquids (see fig A). Fats come mainly from animal sources while oils are mainly from plant sources.\nLike carbohydrates, the chemical elements that all lipid molecules contain are carbon, hydrogen and \noxygen. However, lipids contain a much lower proportion of  oxygen than carbohydrates. Fats and oils contain two types of  organic chemical substance, fatty acids and glycerol (propane-1,2,3-triol). These are combined using ester bonds. Glycerol has the chemical formula C\n3H8O3 (see fig B).\nAll fatty acids have a long hydrocarbon chain \u2013 a folded backbone of  carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms attached, and a carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) at one end. Living tissues contain more than 70 different types of  fatty acid. Fatty acids vary in two ways:\n \u2022the length of\n the carbon chain can differ (but is often 15\u201317 carbon atoms long)\n \u2022the f\natty acid may be a saturated fatty acid or an unsaturated fatty acid.\nIn a saturated fatty acid, each carbon atom is joined to the one next to it by a single covalent bond. A common example is stearic acid (see fig C). In an unsaturated fatty acid, the carbon chains have one or more double covalent bonds between carbon atoms in them.

Proteins make \nhair, skin and nails, the enzymes needed for metabolism and digestion, and many of  the hormones that control the different body systems. They enable muscle fibres to contract, make antibodies that protect you from disease, help clot your blood and transport oxygen in the form of  haemoglobin. Understanding the structure of  proteins helps you understand the detailed biology of  cells and organisms. Like carbohydrates and lipids, proteins contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. In addition, they all contain nitrogen and many proteins also contain sulfur.\nProteins are a group of  macromolecules made up of  many \nsmall monomer units called amino acids joined together by condensation reactions. Amino acids combine in long chains to produce proteins. There are about 20 different naturally occurring amino acids that can combine in different ways to produce a wide range of  different proteins.\nAMINO ACIDS\nAll amino acids have the same basic structure, which is represented as a general formula. There is always an amino group (\u2013NH\n2) and a carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) attached to a carbon \natom (see fig A). The group known as the R group varies between amino acids. Some amino acids contain sulfur and selenium in their R group. The R groups are not involved in the reactions which join the amino acids together, but the structure of  the R group does affect the way the amino acid interacts with others within the protein molecule. This will mainly depend on whether the R\u00a0group is polar or not, and these interactions affect the tertiary structure of  the protein formed (see page 18).\nThis part is common \nto all amino acids and \nis just shown as a \nshaded rectangle in the examples below.general formula\nglycine cysteineN HR\nH HCC OH\nO\nHC H2SH\n \n\u25b2 fig A  Some differ ent amino acids.

Both of  these environmental factors are common \nin Middle Eastern countries. Biological molecules have an amazing number of  different roles in living organisms, including some you would not expect. In this activity, you will discover how current research shows that the disaccharide trehalose can protect proteins from damage in stressful conditions. This property is being used to make dry eyes more comfortable \u2013 and possibly protect the brain from the damage that can result from ageing.\nMEDICAL JOURNAL ARTICLE\nAbstract\nTrehalose is a naturally occurring disaccharide comprising \ntwo molecules of glucose. The sugar is widespread in many species of plants and animals, where its function appears to be to protect cells against desiccation, but it is not found in mammals. Trehalose has the ability to protect cellular membranes and labile proteins against damage and denaturation as a result of desiccation and oxidative stress. Trehalose appears to be the most effective sugar for protection against desiccation. Although the exact mechanism by which trehalose protects labile macromolecules and lipid membranes is unknown, credible hypotheses do exist. As well as being used in large quantities in the food industry, trehalose is used in the biopharmaceutical preservation of labile protein drugs and in the cryopreservation of human cells. Trehalose is under investigation for a number of medical applications, including the treatment of Huntington\u2019s chorea [disease] and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Recent studies have shown that trehalose can also prevent damage to mammalian eyes caused by desiccation and oxidative insult. These unique properties of trehalose have thus prompted its investigation as a component in treatment for dry eye syndrome. This interesting and unique disaccharide appears to have properties which may be exploited in ophthalmology and other disease states.\nTrehalose, a naturally occurring alpha-linked disaccharide \nformed of two molecules of glucose ( fig A) \u2026 is synthesized \nby many living organisms, including insects, plants, fungi, and micro-organisms as a response to prolonged periods of desiccation. This very useful property, known as anhydrobiosis, confers on an organism the ability to survive almost complete dehydration for prolonged periods and subsequently reanimate.HO\nHO OH HO OHHO OOOH\nOHO\nfig A  Structur e of trehalose; Registry number: 99-20-7; Molar mass: 342.296 \ng\/mol (anhydrous); 378.33 g\/mol (dihydrate); molecular structure: \n\u03b1-D-glucopyranosyl \u03b1-D-glucopyranoside (\u03b1,\u03b1-trehalose)\nReferences\n1\n Iturriaga G., Su\u00e1rez R., Nova-Franco B. \nTrehalose \nmetabolism: From osmoprotection to signaling.

We do not expect doctors to be able to do the same for our bodies. But they can do a lot to replace or repair the various parts of the circulatory system. The heart can have new valves, new blood vessels to supply the muscle and can even be replaced in a transplant. The blood vessels can be opened up, unblocked or replaced with grafts from other healthy areas of the body. Blood can be replaced by transfusions, and the bone marrow that makes the blood cells can be replaced by transplants. Doctors have even developed techniques by which they can operate on the circulatory system of a fetus in the uterus, to give blood transfusions or repair some heart conditions long before birth.\nIn this chapter, you will be looking at mammalian transport systems. This involves studying the general \nprinciples of circulatory systems and why larger organisms need a complex circulatory system.

One of  the main ways substances move into \nand out of  cells is by diffusion. Diffusion is the free movement of  particles in a liquid or a gas down a concentration gradient. This movement is from an area where the particles are at a relatively high concentration to an area where they are at a relatively low concentration (see Section 2A.2).\nIn single-celled organisms and microscopic multicellular organisms, diffusion is sufficient to supply all their needs. However, when organisms reach a certain size, diffusion alone is not enough.\nTRANSPORT IN SMALL ORGANISMS\nFor a single-celled organism like an amoeba and for very small multicellular organisms including many marine larvae, the nutrients and oxygen that they need can diffuse directly into the cells from the external environment and waste substances can diffuse directly out. This works well for the following reasons.\n \u2022T\nhe diffusion distances from the outside to the innermost areas of  \nthe cells are very small.\n \u2022T\nhe surface area in contact with the outside environment is very \nlarge when compared to the volume of  the inside of  the organism. Its surface area to volume ratio (sa\n :\n v\nol) is large, so there is \na relatively big surface area over which substances can diffuse into or out of  the organism (see figs A and B).\n \u2022T\nhe metabolic demands are low \u2013 the organisms do not regulate \ntheir own temperature and the cells do not use much oxygen and food or produce much carbon dioxide.\nSingle-celled organisms and very small multicellular organisms do not need specialised transport systems because diffusion is enough to supply their needs.\n\u25b2 fig A  T he surface area : volume ratio of this tiny jellyfish larva is relatively \nlarge so simple diffusion can supply all its needs.MODELLING SURFACE AREA\u00a0:\u00a0VOLUME RATIOS\nThe surface area\u00a0to\u00a0volume ratio of  an organism is the key factor \nthat determines whether diffusion alone will allow substances to move into and out of  all the cells rapidly enough. However, it is not easy to calculate the surface area\u00a0to\u00a0volume ratio of  organisms such as elephants, people and palm trees. It is difficult even for a single-celled Amoeba because of  its irregular shape.\nSo scientists use models to help show what happens in the real \nsituation (see fig B). A simple cube makes surface area\u00a0to\u00a0volume calculations easy. The bigger the organism gets, the smaller the surface area\u00a0to\u00a0volume ratio becomes. The distance from the outside of  the organism to the inside gets longer, and there is proportionately less surface for substances to enter through. So it takes longer for substances to diffuse in, and they may not reach the individual cells quickly enough to supply all their needs.\n1 mm cubeLarger surface area\ncompared to volume.\nSurface area 6 sides 3 12\n5 6  mm2\nVolume 13 5 1  mm3\nSurface areato volume rati\no6 : 16 sides 3 22\n5 24  mm2\n23 5 8  mm3\n3 : 16 sides 3 42\n5 96  mm2\n43 5 64  mm3\n3 : 2\nSurface area\n3.14  \u00b5m2\nVolume4\nr 3 4\n3pr 2p\n0.52  \u00b5m3\nSurface area\nto volume rati o6 : 112.57  \u00b5m2\n4.19  \u00b5m3\n3 : 150.27  \u00b5m2\n33.51  \u00b5m3\n3 : 22 mm cube 4 mm cubeSmaller surface area\ncompared to volume.\n0.5 \u00b5m radius 1 \u00b5m 2 \u00b5m\n\u25b2 fig B  In this diagr am, the cubes and spheres represent models  \nof organisms.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that small organisms have a small surface area.

This is made up of  a series of  vessels with the heart as a pump to move blood through the vessels. The blood is the transport medium and its passage through the vessels is called the circulation. The system delivers the materials needed by the cells of  the body, and carries away the waste products of  their metabolism. Substances move between the plasma or red blood cells and the body cells by diffusion or by active transport (see Section 2A.4). The tiniest blood vessels have walls only one cell thick, so diffusion distances are short and substances pass easily across these into other cells. Every cell in the body is near one of  these small vessels. The blood also carries out other functions, such as carrying hormones (chemical messages) from one part of  the body to another, forming part of  the defence system of  the body and distributing heat.\nTHE COMPONENTS OF THE BLOOD AND THEIR \nMAIN FUNCTIONS\nY ou are going to study all three parts of  the cardiovascular \nsystem, starting with the transport medium \u2013 the blood. Y our blood is a complex mixture carrying a wide variety of  cells and substances to all areas of  your body (see fig A).\nred blood\ncellplateletplasma\nwhitebloodcell\n\u25b2 fig A  T his light micrograph shows red blood cells, white blood cells  \nand platelets.LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n \u25fcUnder stand the role of haemoglobin in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide.\n \u25fcUnder\nstand the oxygen dissociation curve of haemoglobin, the Bohr effect and the significance of the oxygen affinity \nof fetal haemoglobin compared with adult haemoglobin.\n \u25fcUnder\nstand the blood clotting process.\nPLASMA\nY our blood plasma is the fluid part of  your mass transport system. \nOver 50% of  your blood volume is plasma, and it carries all of  your blood cells and everything else that needs transporting around your body. This includes:\n \u2022dig\nested food products (e.g. glucose and amino acids) from the \nsmall intestine to the liver and then to all the parts of  the body where they are needed either for immediate use or storage\n \u2022nutrient molecules fr\nom storage areas to the cells that need \nthem\n \u2022e\nxcretory products (e.g. carbon dioxide and urea) from cells to \nthe organs such as the lungs or kidneys that excrete them from the body\n \u2022chemical messa\nges (hormones) from where they are made to \nwhere they cause changes in the body.\nThe plasma helps to maintain a steady body temperature by transferring heat around the system from internal organs (e.g. the gut) or very active tissues (e.g. leg muscles in someone running) to the skin, where it can be lost to the surroundings. It also acts as a buffer to regulate pH changes.\nERYTHROCYTES (RED BLOOD CELLS)\nThere are approximately 5 million erythrocytes per mm3 of  blood \n(4\u20135 million per mm3 in women, 5\u20136\u00a0million per mm3 in men). \nThey contain haemoglobin, a red pigment that carries oxygen and gives them their colour (see Section 1A.5). They are made in the bone marrow. Mature erythrocytes do not contain a nucleus and have a limited life of  about 120 days.\nThe erythrocytes transport oxygen from the lungs to all the cells. \nThey are well adapted for their function. The biconcave disc shape of  the cells means that they have a large surface area to volume ratio, so oxygen can diffuse into and out of  them rapidly (see fig B). Having no nucleus leaves much more space inside the cells for the haemoglobin molecules that carry the oxygen. In fact, each red blood cell contains around 250\u2013300\u00a0million molecules of  haemoglobin and can carry approximately 1000\u00a0million molecules of  oxygen. Haemoglobin also carries some of  the carbon dioxide produced in respiration back to the lungs. The rest is transported in the plasma.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

The arteries and veins are like the large roads carrying heavy traffic while the narrow town streets and tracks are represented by the vast area of  branching and spreading capillaries called the capillary network. In the capillary network, substances carried by the blood are exchanged with cells in the same way that products are transported from factories, oil refineries or farms and distributed into shops and homes. The structures of  the different types of  blood vessel closely reflect their functions in your body.\nARTERIES\nArteries carry blood away from your heart towards the cells of  your body. The structure of  an artery is shown in fig A. Almost all arteries carry oxygenated blood. The exceptions are:\n \u2022the pulmonar\ny artery \u2013 carrying deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs\n \u2022the umbilical ar\ntery \u2013 during pregnancy, this carries deoxygenated blood from the fetus to  \nthe placenta.\nThe arteries leaving the heart branch off  in every direction, and the diameter of  the lumen, the central space inside the blood vessel, gets smaller the further away it is from the heart. The very smallest branches of  the arterial system, furthest from the heart, are the arterioles. \nThe middle layers of\nthe artery wall containelastic \ufb01bres and smoothmuscle; arteries nearestthe heart have more elastic\ufb01bres, those further fromthe heart have a greaterproportion of muscle tissue.\nelastic \ufb01bres andsmooth musclelumentough outerlayer\nendotheliumexternal layerof tough tissue\nThe endothelium forms asmooth lining which allows theeasiest possible \ufb02ow of blood.Lumen is small whenartery unstretched by\ufb02ow of blood from heart.\n\u25b2 fig A  T he structure of an artery means it is adapted to cope with the surging of the blood as the heart pumps.\nBlood is pumped out from the heart in a regular rhythm, about 70 times a minute. Each heartbeat \nsends a high-pressure flow of  blood into the arteries. The major arteries close to the heart must withstand these pressure surges. Their walls contain a lot of  elastic fibres, so they can stretch to accommodate the greater volume of  blood without being damaged (see fig B). Between surges, the elastic fibres return to their original length, squeezing the blood to move it along in a continuous flow. The pulse you can feel in an artery is the effect of  the surge each time the heart beats. The blood pressure in all arteries is relatively high, but it falls in arteries further away from the heart. These are known as the peripheral arteries. LEARNING TIP\nRemember that all arteries carry \nblood away from the heart, so they have thick walls and lots of collagen to withstand the high pressure.\nEXAM HINT\nYou will study the structure and the function of the types of blood vessel separately. However, you should remember that the vessels do not exist separately \u2013 they are all interlinked within the whole circulatory system.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

In an average lifetime, the heart beats about 3\n 000\n 000\n 000 (3 \u00d7 109) times and \nwill pump over 200\u00a0million litres of  blood \u2013 quite a workload.\nTHE STRUCTURE OF THE HEART\nThe human heart, like other mammalian hearts (see fig A), is not a single muscular pump but two pumps, joined and working in time together. The right side of  the heart receives blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs. The left side of  the heart receives blood from the lungs and pumps it to the body. The blood in each side of  the heart does not mix with the blood from the other side. The two sides are separated by a thick, muscular septum. The heart is made of  a unique type of  muscle, known as cardiac muscle, which has special properties \u2013 it can carry on contracting regularly without resting or getting fatigued. Y ou will study this in more detail in Book 2 Topic 7. Cardiac muscle has a good blood supply \u2013 the coronary arteries bring oxygenated blood to the tissue (see fig B).

Cardiovascular diseases are \nthose of the heart and blood vessels. You will learn how we can determine what causes cardiovascular diseases and what increases the chances of us developing such diseases. Diet is an important factor and the things we choose to eat can increase the risk of developing these life-threatening diseases. Fortunately, making the right choices can also significantly decrease the risks. You will learn how scientists and health professionals can use evidence to analyse the risks and how these diseases can be treated.\nMATHS SKILLS FOR THIS CHAPTER\n \u2022Recognise and make use of appropriate units in calculations (e.g. calculating a BMI in kg  m\u20132)\n \u2022Recognise and use expressions in decimal and standard form \n(e.g. calculating a person\u2019s BMI)\n \u2022Use ratios, fractions and percentages \n(e.g. calculating proportions of the population with certain risk factors)\n \u2022Construct and interpret frequency tables and diagrams, bar charts and histograms \n(e.g. interpreting data about \nincidence of disease or the effect of reducing risk factors)\n \u2022Understand simple probability \n(e.g. considering the chances of developing a particular cardiovascular disease)\n \u2022Use a scatter diagram to identify a correlation between two variables \n(e.g. comparing risk of developing a disease \nwith risk factors such as diet or blood pressure)\n \u2022Translate information between graphical, numerical and algebraic forms \n(e.g. draw graphs from data tables or \nselect data from graphs about various risk factors)\n \u2022Calculate rate of change from a graph showing a linear relationship \n(e.g. calculate how quickly the proportion of \npeople who are obese has increased over the last 50 years)\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Some of  these diseases \naffect you randomly \u2013 there is nothing you can do to change whether you are affected or not. However, for many diseases, especially non-communicable (non-infectious) conditions such as heart disease \nand cancer, you can increase or lower your risk of  becoming ill, based on factors in your lifestyle. If  you understand the risk factors, you can help to make yourself  and your family healthier.\nWHAT IS RISK?\nThe word risk is used regularly in everyday conversation, but in science it has a very specific meaning. In science, risk describes the probability that an event will happen. Probability means the chance or likelihood of  the event, calculated mathematically. For example, imagine you have six coloured balls \u2013 red, blue, green, yellow, orange and purple \u2013 in a black cloth bag (see fig A). If  you reach in and pull out a single ball, the probability (risk) of  getting, say, a green ball can be expressed in one of  three ways:\n \u20221 in 6\n \u20220.166\n 66 r\necurring (0.17)\n \u202217%.\nT\nhis is the case for any one of  the six colours in the bag. In the same way, it is possible to work out \nyour risk of  developing certain specified diseases or of  dying from a specified cause. \nHOW DO WE PERCEIVE RISK? \nThe actual risk of  doing something is not always the same as the sense of  risk one feels. Most people don\u2019t think twice before getting into their car \u2013 but globally you have an annual risk of  1 in 5747 of  being killed in a road traffic accident. On the other hand, many people get very worried before flying, but commercial flights have a 1 in 4.5\u20135.5\u00a0million risk of  crashing. Personal perception of  risk is based on a variety of  factors which include: \n \u2022ho\nw familiar you are with the activity \n \u2022ho\nw much you enjoy the activity\n \u2022w\nhether or not you approve of  the activity. \nThe actual mathematical risk may play very little part in developing your personal perception of  risk. People often overestimate the benefits, or minimise the risk, of  behaviour that they want to continue. For example, there is now strong evidence from around the world that obesity is linked to a range of  diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers. However, people like eating and so they still become overweight. On the other hand, they will over-emphasise the risks of  activities if  they want to avoid them or prevent others from doing them. For example, parents over-emphasise the risk of  wandering away to small children, to help make the child behave and stay close.\nIn another example, there is good scientific evidence that smoking affects our risk of  developing \ndiseases such as atherosclerosis, as well as lung cancer. However, knowledge of  the mathematical risk of  an early death if  you smoke cigarettes doesn\u2019t always stop people from smoking.\u25b2 fig A  T he risk, chance or \nprobability that you will pick a blue ball out of the black bag is 1 in 6. If\u00a0you return the ball to the bag each time, you will have exactly the same probability of picking a blue ball again the next time. The probability will always be 1\u00a0in 6.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Eat fruit and vegetables, drink orange juice, take lots of  exercise, enjoy these foods \u2013 how do we know which advice is based on good science, and which is given to us because someone wants to sell us something? There are many ways in which you can evaluate the design of  studies to decide if  the data are meaningful.\nDESIGNING STUDIES\nMost epidemiological studies are based on a very big sample size \u2013 usually, the bigger the study, the more meaningful the results. \nThe ideal is to investigate one factor or variable, keeping all other \nvariables the same (controlled). However, controlling variables is almost impossible when you are working with human beings. The way people live is complex and varies a lot, so it is hard to detect how any one factor affects people. When a larger number of  people are studied, it is more likely that patterns may emerge, even with all the other differences between the people involved. Evidence based on large amounts of  data is more likely to be statistically significant than evidence based on small studies.\nSome epidemiological studies are carried out over a long time. \nThese longitudinal studies are very valuable because they follow the same group of  individuals over many years (see fig\u00a0A). This means the impact of  their known lifestyle on their health can be tracked over time. For example, the M\u00fcnster Heart Study looked at cardiovascular disease in 10\n 856 men a\nged 36\u201365 in \nEurope, following them from the start of  the study well into the 21st century. The results from this study are still seen as important because so many people were involved over a long period of  time. The Framingham Study in the US also provided much data \u2013 but was limited because they were all from similar American citizens. The study started in 1948 and it is still going on \u2013 the scientists have widened the population they gather data from, so it is more relevant now.\nAn ambitious new study called the National Children\u2019s Study has \nbeen set up in the US to follow 100\n 000 childr\nen from birth until \nthey are 21 years old. From 2008\u20132012, children were selected to be representative of  the whole of  the US population. One major objective of  the study is to examine how environmental inputs and genetic factors interact to affect the health and development of  children. This is believed to be the biggest longitudinal study ever set up. Similarly, the UAE Healthy Future Study will be longitudinal, looking at the same group of  volunteers over a number of  years.\nSometimes, scientists look at all the available studies in a subject \narea and analyse the available data in a massive literature study. This combines small and large studies and can give more reliable evidence than any one of  the studies alone. This is called a metadata analysis (meta-analysis).\nEVALUATING SCIENTIFIC STUDIES\nWhen considering a study, you need to examine the methodology to see if  it is valid. That means that it is properly designed to answer the question or questions being asked. Y ou also need to see if  the measurements have been carried out with precision. It is important to find out if  other scientists have been able to repeat the methodology and have had similar results \u2013 if  so, the results are considered more reliable.\nIt is also important to know who carried out the research, who \nfunded it and where it was published. Then to decide whether or not any of  these factors might have affected or biased the study. Y ou need to evaluate the data and conclusions from the study in the light of  all these factors.\nEXAM HINT\nRemember the meaning of the following terms.\nValid: answers the question the scientists are askingPrecise: measurements with little difference between themReliable: the investigation is repeatable by other scientists who get \nsimilar results\nThey are important in evaluating all practical work and research.\nIn the next few pages, you are going to look at some of  the \nevidence that scientists have collected suggesting factors that may \u2013 or may not \u2013 affect your risk of  developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In each case, you need to look carefully at the type of  evidence that is presented and think about what else you need to know to make firm conclusions.\nRISK FACTORS FOR CVDs\nThe results from many epidemiological studies have identified a range of  risk factors linked to CVDs. These factors divide into two main groups \u2013 those you can\u2019t change and those you can do something about (see Section 1C.3).\nNON-MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS FOR ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nThere are three main risk factors for CVDs which cannot (at the present time) be changed.\n \u2022Genes\n: studies show that there is a genetic tendency (trend) \nin some families, and also in some ethnic groups, to develop CVDs.

Y our lifestyle can affect your \nrisk of  developing atherosclerosis in the future. Epidemiological studies have shown links with smoking, diet and weight, lack of  activity and high blood pressure. These are the factors we can change, so we can change our risk of  developing CVDs by the lifestyle choices we make.\nSMOKING AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nStudies have shown that smokers are far more likely to develop atherosclerosis than non-smokers with a similar lifestyle. Nine out of  ten people who need heart bypass surgery or stents as a result of  atherosclerosis are smokers. In 2007, a Spanish study showed a clear correlation between smoking and the incidence of  death from atherosclerotic heart disease. Causation was established by further research. For example, studies found that the substances in tobacco smoke:\n \u2022can dama\nge the artery linings, which makes the build-up of  plaques more likely\n \u2022can cause the ar\nteries to narrow, raise the blood pressure and increase the risk of  atherosclerosis.\nSimilar findings were made in a study on adults with heart disease in Jordan in 2017 (see fig B).1.16 1.12\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

It certainly has a big impact on the health of  our cardiovascular system. However, our understanding of  what the effect is and how our food affects our risk of  developing cardiovascular diseases keeps changing as scientists learn more.\nWEIGHT ISSUES\nThere is plenty of  food in the developed world and people can easily eat more than they need to supply the metabolic needs of  the body. This means that many people have a positive energy balance. The excess food energy is converted into a store of  fat so these people become overweight and then obese. All the evidence suggests that being obese increases your risk of  developing many different diseases, including CVDs.\nMEASURING A HEALTHY WEIGHT:  \nTHE BODY MASS INDEX\nWhat do we mean by \u2018overweight\u2019? It isn\u2019t just how much you weigh. Doctors and scientists look at your body mass index (BMI) to decide if  you are unhealthily heavy (see fig A). This compares your weight to your height in a simple formula:\nBMI = \n   w\neight in kilograms  ________________   (height in metres)2   \nF\nor an adult, the following definitions apply:\n \u2022a BMI of\n less than 18.5\n kg\n m\u20132 means you are \nunderweight\n \u2022a BMI of\n 18.5\u201325\n kg\n m\u20132 is the ideal range\n \u2022a BMI o\nver 25 and up to 30\n kg\n m\u20132 means you \nare overweight\n \u2022a BMI of\n 30\u201340\n kg\n m\u20132 is considered obese\n \u2022a BMI o\nver 40\n kg\n m\u20132 defines you as morbidly \nobese.\nEXAM HINT\nUsing numbers in examinations has always been a \nweak point with biology students.\nIf you can apply your maths skills accurately, you \nwill gain marks easily.

Lots of  studies show that eating lots of  fruit and vegetables \nbenefits your health in many ways \u2013 including reducing your risk of  developing CVDs. The graph in fig A is one piece of  evidence which shows how eating five or more portions of  fruit or vegetables a day can lower your risk of  having a heart attack. It was based on data from a longitudinal study of  more than 84\n 000 w\nomen and 42\n 000 men o\nver eight years, looking at their fruit and vegetable intake \nand cardiac health. \n00.20.40.60.81.01.2Relative risk of coronary\nheart disease\n4.0\u20134.9 5.0\u20135.9 <3.0 3.0\u20133.9\nFruit and vegetable intake (servings per day)6.0\u20136.9 \u22657.0\n\u25b2 fig A  T his graph shows the impact of eating increasing amounts of fruit and vegetables on the risk for coronary \nheart disease.\nANTIOXIDANTS AND HEART HEALTH\nHowever, as you know, it isn\u2019t enough to show a correlation between two things. We need to show \nhow one thing causes another and we still don\u2019t really know how fruit and vegetables have their effect. They are very varied in their chemistry. For some time, it was thought that the antioxidants found in fruit and vegetables might be the answer. Vitamins, such as vitamin A found in carrots, vitamin C from citrus fruits and vitamin E from leafy green vegetables, almonds and sunflower oil, are antioxidants and they are found in fruits and vegetables. Several studies appeared to show that antioxidants were the answer and many people started taking antioxidant supplements to protect their hearts. However, recent studies, including some very large metadata analyses (studies where scientists have looked at the results of  many different investigations), have shown that the evidence for antioxidants being good for your heart is inconclusive. There is some evidence that some antioxidants may cause harm.\nVITAMIN C: A CASE STUDY\nVitamin C is important in the formation of  connective tissue in the body, such as in the bones, teeth, skin and many internal body surfaces including the endothelial lining of  blood vessels. A severe lack of  vitamin C in the diet causes scurvy, which can result in bleeding gums, bruising easily and painful joints. As you have seen, if  the lining of  an artery is damaged, atherosclerosis is more likely to develop. So, it makes sense, in theory, that if  your diet is low in vitamin C, your arteries are more likely to be damaged and you are more likely to be affected by CVD. \nA study published in the British Medical Journal in 1997 looked at the association between \nconcentration of  vitamin C in the blood and risk of  heart attack in 1605 men from eastern Finland. The men had no sign of  coronary artery disease when they were tested between 1984 and 1989. Their vitamin C levels were also tested.

Why do they do this? \nPREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE \nCardiovascular disease has a negative effect on individuals, on families  and on society. It costs a lot of  money to treat people in hospital. When  people are too ill to work, they are losing money for their families, and  also for the companies where they work. Treating people with drugs to  prevent them from needing surgery is cheaper for health service providers.  It is even cheaper (and better for the individual) if  we can stop ourselves  needing the drugs. So, prevention is better than treatment for CVDs for  many reasons (see fig A). However, persuading people to change their  \nlifestyle habits is often difficult.\nFor example, there is a lot of  reliable evidence to show that smoking is  \none of  the highest risk factors for CVDs. However, if  you stop smoking,  your risk of  developing heart disease is almost halved after just one year.  Moreover, research carried out by a team led by Azra Mahmud from  Trinity College Dublin and published in 2007 suggests that after 10 years,  the arteries of  smokers who stop smoking are the same as if  they had  never smoked. There is a lot of  support available for people who want to  stop smoking. Y et, despite all this, almost 1 billion people around the  world smoke cigarettes and millions of  them die each year of  CVDs and  cancers linked to their smoking. \nHealth education programmes in schools and communities can help to  \nmake sure that everyone is aware of  the risks associated with different  lifestyle choices. However, each individual has to make their own choices  and take their own risks.\nOVERWEIGHT OR UNDERFIT?\nMost people are aware that obesity is linked to CVDs, and many go on  slimming diets to try to lose weight. Most people also know that taking  regular exercise helps protect against CVDs \u2013 but more people choose to  go on a diet than choose to take regular exercise. The results of  a study  carried out over an average of  eight years on 20\n 000 men a\nged from  \n30 to 83 years are given in Section 1C.4 fig\u00a0B. Fitness was defined by  how much oxygen they used during exercise. The results show that if  you  are obese and fit you have a lower risk of  dying from CVDs than someone  who is not obese but unfit. Obviously, being the correct weight and fit is  best of  all! \nThe problem is that many people enjoy their food, and don\u2019t take sufficient exercise. It takes a lot of  \neffort to cut down the amount of  food you eat and change to eating healthier foods including lots of  fruit and vegetables. \u25b2\n fig A  Infogr aphics like this one published in Gulf News help \npeople understand the factors which affect their heart health.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember to read all the \ninformation in graphics.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Changing lifestyle, such as improving diet, giving up smoking and taking more exercise can help but there are also various drugs that can be given. The drugs aim to reduce the risks associated with CVDs by helping to prevent problems developing. However, all medicines carry some risk. \nCONTROLLING BLOOD PRESSURE\nAs you have seen, hypertension or high blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.\nANTIHYPERTENSIVES\nDrugs that reduce blood pressure are known as antihypertensives. Some commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs are described below.\n \u2022T\nreatment often begins with diuretics, which increase the volume \nof  urine produced. This eliminates excess fluids and salts, so that the blood volume decreases. With less blood, a smaller volume is pumped from the heart and the blood pressure falls. \n \u2022Beta b\nlockers interfere with the normal system for controlling \nthe heart. They block the response of  the heart to hormones such as adrenaline, which normally act to speed up the heart and increase the blood pressure (you will find out more in Book 2 Topic 7). So, beta blockers make the heart rate slower and the contractions less strong, so the blood pressure is lower.\nSympathetic nerve inhibitors affect the sympathetic nerves which go from your central nervous system to all parts of  your body (you will find out more in Book 2 Topic 7). Sympathetic nerves stimulate your arteries to constrict, which raises your blood pressure. The inhibitors prevent these nerves signalling to the arteries, which helps to keep the arteries dilated and your blood pressure lower.\n \u2022Angiotensin is a hor\nmone which stimulates the constriction of  \nyour blood vessels and so causes the blood pressure to rise. ACE inhibitors block the production of  angiotensin, which reduces the constriction of  your blood vessels and so keeps your blood pressure lower.\nThe benefits of  these drugs in reducing blood pressure are clear. They reduce the risk of  CVDs, and also reduce the risk of  damage to the kidneys and eyes from the high blood pressure. \nBut there are risks. The risks of  these treatments are twofold. \nIf  the treatment is not monitored carefully, your blood pressure may become too low. That can lead to falls and injuries which, particularly in elderly patients, can be serious and even life-threatening. The second major risk is the side-effects that may result from the way your body reacts to the drugs. Each type of  drug has its own possible side-effects (see fig A). For a drug to be given a licence for use, the benefits of  the treatment must be judged to outweigh any side-effects.\nThe side-effects from commonly used antihypertensives include \ncoughs, swelling of  the ankles, impotence, tiredness and fatigue, and constipation. These are not serious compared with the health risks from high blood pressure \u2013 but to the patient they may feel very significant. High blood pressure often doesn\u2019t make you feel ill, but the medication needed to control it can affect your quality of  life. Doctors find many patients stop taking their medication \u2013 the side-effects make them ignore the much larger but invisible risk of  CVDs.\n\u25b2 fig A  All medically licensed drugs c ome with instructions and information \nwhich includes possible side-effects known to be caused by the drug.\nEXAM HINT\nIf you are asked to discuss or evaluate the use of medication or some \nother treatment, you must remember to include both the benefits and the potential risks associated with the treatment.\nSTATINS\nStatins are a group of  drugs that lower the level of  cholesterol in \nyour blood. They block the enzyme in the liver that is responsible for making cholesterol, and are very effective at blocking the production of  LDLs. Statins also improve the balance of  LDLs to HDLs and reduce inflammation in the lining of  the arteries. Both functions reduce the risk of  atherosclerosis developing.\nFig B shows the results from a trial using statins with a group of  6605 \nAsian Indians in the US. This shows the results for men and women, and other groups who are high-risk categories for cardiovascular disease. Statins reduce the incidence of  serious cardiovascular disease in all categories, but they seem to have a greater effect for some groups than for others.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Evidence-based guidelines have provided clinicians with valuable data for better applying diagnostic and therapeutic tools, particularly the overwhelming new imaging technology and other, often expensive, therapies and devices, in heart failure patients. In the Middle East, progress has recently been made with the development of regional and multi-centre registries to evaluate the quality of care for patients with heart failure. A new heart function clinic recently began operation and has clearly resulted in a reduced readmission rate for heart failure patients. Many Middle Eastern countries have observed increases in the prevalence of the risk factors for the development of heart failure, including diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension, with heart failure in the Middle Eastern population developing earlier than it is in their Western counterparts by at least 10 years. The earlier onset of disease is the result of the earlier onset of coronary artery disease, highlighting the need for Middle Eastern countries to establish prevention programs across all age groups. The health systems across the Middle East need to be modified in order to provide improved evidence-based medical care. Existing registries also need to be expanded to include long-term survey data, and additional funding for heart failure research is warranted.References\nHazebroek M.,\n \nDennert R.,\n \nHeymans S.

Everyone knows this. Yet the jerboa, a small rodent found throughout Asia and \nNorthern Africa, may never drink water in its life. The jerboa (family Dipodidae) is found in both hot and cold deserts from the Sahara Desert to the Gobi Desert. It is extremely well adapted for dry desert environments and gets the water it needs from the food it eats. This includes plant leaves, roots and seeds, and in some cases insects. Jerboas also produce tiny amounts of very concentrated urine to get rid of their waste products, another adaptation for saving the water needed for life.\nBiology is the study of living things. The basic unit of life is the cell, but underpinning all life is chemistry. The way \natoms are bonded together affects the way chemicals work in the cells \u2013 and that affects everything, from the way plants make food by photosynthesis to the way your eyes respond to light.\nIn this chapter, you will be looking at some of the important ways in which atoms and molecules interact to \nmake up the chemistry of life. You will be using these basic principles throughout your biology course because they are fundamental to the structures and functions of all the organisms you will study.\nYou will see how the chemistry of water enables life to survive and chemical reactions to continue. You will look \nat carbohydrates, from the simplest sugars to the most complex polysaccharides. These molecules have a wide variety of uses in organisms, from the fuel for cellular respiration to the main structural material in plants. As you discover how the molecules are joined together, you will recognise the relationships between the structure of the molecules and their functions in the body. \nThe same links between structure and function are clear when you look at the structure of lipid molecules. For \nexample, lipids are used as energy stores in both animals and plants. Lipids are non-polar molecules but you will discover how they can become polar in combination with other inorganic groups such as phosphates. This polarity has great importance for the characteristics of the cell membrane.\nAt the end of this chapter, you will study the structure of proteins. They are long chains of amino acids that are \nheld together by chemical bonds to make complex structures. The bonds include the covalent bonds, ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds. \nMATHS SKILLS FOR THIS CHAPTER\n \u2022Recognise and make appropriate use of units in calculations  (e.g. millimetres)\n \u2022Use ratios, fractions and percentages\n (e.g. representing the relationships between atoms in an ion or molecule)\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

If  you understand some of  the basic principles of  chemistry, you will develop a much better understanding of  biological systems.

When the atoms of  two or more different elements react, they form a compound. An atom is made up of  a nucleus containing positive protons and neutral neutrons. The nucleus is surrounded by negative electrons. We can show this in a model as electrons orbiting around the nucleus in shells. When an atom has a full outer shell of  electrons, it is stable and does not react. However, most atoms do not have a full outer shell of  electrons. In chemical reactions, these electrons are involved in changes that give the atom a stable outer shell. There are two ways they can achieve this.\n \u2022Ionic bonding:\n the atoms involved in the reaction give or receive electrons. One atom, or part of  \nthe molecule, gains one or more electrons and becomes an anion (a negative ion).

Biological molecules are often organic compounds. Organic compounds all contain carbon atoms. They also contain atoms of  hydrogen, oxygen and, less frequently, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus. Most of  the material in your body that is not water consists of  these organic molecules. An understanding of  why organic molecules are special will help you to understand the chemistry of  biological molecules including carbohydrates, lipids and proteins.\nEach carbon atom can make four bonds and so it can connect \nto four other atoms. Carbon atoms bond particularly strongly to other carbon atoms to make long chains. The four bonds of  a carbon atom usually form a tetrahedral shape. This means carbon compounds can be rings, branched chains or any number of  three-dimensional (3D) shapes (see fig A). In some carbon compounds small molecules (monomers) bond with many other similar units to make a very large molecule called a polymer. The ability of  carbon to combine and make macromolecules (large molecules) is the basis of  all biological molecules and provides the great variety and complexity found in living things.\nThese two bonds\nare in the plane\nof the paper.\nor more often as:C This bond goesback behind the\nplane of the paper.\nThis bond sticks out ofthe plane of the paper.\ncan be shown with corners representing carbons, and itshydrogens ignored:\nH\nCC\nHHCC\nHH\nHH\nHHC\nHC\nHHCC\nC\nHHC\nHHHH HH\nThis part \nof a chain molecule:\n\u25b2 fig A  T he bonds in a carbon atom have a complicated 3D shape.

They are also important for storing energy and they form an important part of  the cell wall in plants, fungi and bacteria. Sugars and starch are the best known carbohydrates. Sucrose is the familiar white crystalline table sugar; glucose is used as a fuel by the cells of  our bodies. Starch is in rice, flour and potatoes. But the group of  substances called carbohydrates contains many more compounds, as you will discover.\n\u25b2 fig B  Carbohydr ates are important molecules in both plants and animals \n\u2013 and carbohydrate foods like this bread play a major role in the human \ndiet.\nThe basic structure of  all carbohydrates is the same. They consist \nof  carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. There are three main groups of  carbohydrates: monosaccharides, disaccharides and \npolysaccharides. Some have more complex molecules than others (see Section 1A.3).\nMONOSACCHARIDES: THE SIMPLE SUGARS \nMonosaccharides are simple sugars in which there is one oxygen \natom and two hydrogen atoms for each carbon atom in the molecule. A general formula for this can be written (CH\n2O)n. Here \nn can be any number, but it is usually low.\nTriose sugars (n = 3) have three carbon atoms and the general \nformula C3H6O3. They are important in mitochondria, where the \nrespiration process breaks down glucose into triose sugars (see Book 2 Chapter 7A).1A1.4 CP1 1.3 1.2(ii) 1.2(i)\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

They are made of  many monosaccharide units \njoined by condensation reactions that create glycosidic bonds (see Section\u00a01A.2 fig E). Polysaccharides \ndo not have the sweet taste of  many mono- and disaccharides, but these complex polymers include some very important biological molecules.\nMolecules with between 3 and 10 sugar units are known as oligosaccharides, while molecules \ncontaining 11 or more monosaccharides are known as true polysaccharides. The glycosidic bonds in the polysaccharide can be broken to release monosaccharide units for cellular respiration.\nThe glycosidic bond between two glucose units is split by a process known as hydrolysis (see fig\u00a0A).  \nThe hydrolysis reaction is the opposite of  the condensation reaction that created the molecule, so water \nis added to the bond. Starch and glycogen are gradually broken down into shorter and shorter chains and eventually single sugars are left. Disaccharides break down to form two monosaccharides. Hydrolysis takes place during digestion in the gut, and also in the muscle and liver cells when the carbohydrate stores are broken down to release sugars for use in cellular respiration (see Book 2 Chapter 7A).\nH\nHOH\nOHO\n1 46\n2 35\n1,4-glycosidic bondH\nHO OHH O\n1 4\n2 356\nH\nHOH O\n1 4\n2 356H\nOOHH O\n1 4\n2 356\nmaltosecondensation hydrolysis\nH2O H2O\u03b1-glucose \u03b1-glucose\n\u25b2 fig A  Gly cosidic bonds are made by condensation reactions and broken down by hydrolysis.\nCARBOHYDRATES AND ENERGY \nMONOSACCHARIDES AND DISACCHARIDES\nEvery chemical reaction taking place in a cell needs energy. This energy is supplied by a substance \ncalled adenosine triphosphate, ATP . This ATP comes from the breakdown of  the monosaccharide \nglucose, using oxygen, in the process of  cellular respiration. Y ou will learn much more about cellular respiration later in your course in Book 2 Chapter 7A. \nThe arrangement of  atoms in a molecule of  \u03b1-glucose means that it can be broken down completely \nin a series of  reactions, if  oxygen is available. The compounds that are produced, called the end products, are waste carbon dioxide and water, and lots of  ATP . This supplies the energy needed for all the reactions in the cell. LEARNING TIP\nGlycosidic bonds are formed \nwith the removal of a molecule of water in condensation reactions. \nGlycosidic bonds are broken \nwith the addition of a molecule of water in hydrolysis reactions.\nEXAM HINT\nBe careful not to say that this produces or creates energy for cell processes.

They are an \nintegral part of  all cell membranes and are also used as an energy store. Lipids contain many carbon\u2013\nhydrogen bonds and almost no oxygen. When lipids are oxidised in the respiration process, the bonds are broken and carbon dioxide and water are the final products. This reaction can be used to drive the production of  much ATP (see Sections 1A.3, 2A.2 and 2A.4 and Book 2 Chapter 5A). Lipids, \nespecially triglycerides, store about three times as much energy as the same mass of  carbohydrates. Many plants and animals convert spare food into oils or fats as an energy store to use when needed. For example, the seeds of  plants contain lipids to provide energy for the seedling when it starts to grow, which is why seeds are such an important food source for many animals.\nFATS AND OILS\nFats and oils are important groups of  lipids. Chemically they are very similar, but fats such as butter are solids at room temperature whereas oils such as olive oil are liquids (see fig A). Fats come mainly from animal sources while oils are mainly from plant sources.\nLike carbohydrates, the chemical elements that all lipid molecules contain are carbon, hydrogen and \noxygen. However, lipids contain a much lower proportion of  oxygen than carbohydrates. Fats and oils contain two types of  organic chemical substance, fatty acids and glycerol (propane-1,2,3-triol). These are combined using ester bonds. Glycerol has the chemical formula C\n3H8O3 (see fig B).\nAll fatty acids have a long hydrocarbon chain \u2013 a folded backbone of  carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms attached, and a carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) at one end. Living tissues contain more than 70 different types of  fatty acid. Fatty acids vary in two ways:\n \u2022the length of\n the carbon chain can differ (but is often 15\u201317 carbon atoms long)\n \u2022the f\natty acid may be a saturated fatty acid or an unsaturated fatty acid.\nIn a saturated fatty acid, each carbon atom is joined to the one next to it by a single covalent bond. A common example is stearic acid (see fig C). In an unsaturated fatty acid, the carbon chains have one or more double covalent bonds between carbon atoms in them. A monounsaturated fatty acid has one carbon\u2013carbon double bond and a polyunsaturated fatty acid has more than one carbon\u2013carbon double bond (see fig\u00a0D). Linoleic acid is an example of  a polyunsaturated fatty acid. It is an essential fatty acid in our diet because we cannot make it from other substances.\nCH3COOH (CH2)16CH\nHH\nHC HCH\nHH\nHCCH\nHH\nHCCH\nHH\nHCCH\nHH\nHCCH\nHH\nHCCH\nHH\nHCCH\nHH\nHCC OHH\nHCO\n\u25b2 fig C  Displa yed formula of stearic acid, a saturated fatty acid found in both plant and animal fats\nCH\nHH\nHC HCH\nHH\nHCCH H\nHCCH\nHH\nCC\ncarbon\u2013carbon double bondH H\nCCH\nHH\nHCCH\nHH\nHCCH\nHH\nHCC OHH\nHCO\n \n\u25b2 fig D  Displa yed formula of linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acidH\nHH CH\nCH\nOH OH OHC\n\u25b2 fig B  Displa yed formula of \nglycerol (propane-1,2,3-triol)LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n \u25fcKnow how a trigly ceride is synthesised by the formation of ester bonds during condensation reactions between \nglycerol and three fatty acids.\n \u25fcDescribe the diff\nerences between unsaturated and saturated fatty acids.\n\u25b2 fig A  Oliv e oil comes from \npressed olives and is widely used for food and cooking around the world.1.5(ii) 1.5(i)\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Proteins make \nhair, skin and nails, the enzymes needed for metabolism and digestion, and many of  the hormones that control the different body systems. They enable muscle fibres to contract, make antibodies that protect you from disease, help clot your blood and transport oxygen in the form of  haemoglobin. Understanding the structure of  proteins helps you understand the detailed biology of  cells and organisms. Like carbohydrates and lipids, proteins contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. In addition, they all contain nitrogen and many proteins also contain sulfur.\nProteins are a group of  macromolecules made up of  many \nsmall monomer units called amino acids joined together by condensation reactions. Amino acids combine in long chains to produce proteins. There are about 20 different naturally occurring amino acids that can combine in different ways to produce a wide range of  different proteins.\nAMINO ACIDS\nAll amino acids have the same basic structure, which is represented as a general formula. There is always an amino group (\u2013NH\n2) and a carboxyl group (\u2013COOH) attached to a carbon \natom (see fig A). The group known as the R group varies between amino acids. Some amino acids contain sulfur and selenium in their R group. The R groups are not involved in the reactions which join the amino acids together, but the structure of  the R group does affect the way the amino acid interacts with others within the protein molecule. This will mainly depend on whether the R\u00a0group is polar or not, and these interactions affect the tertiary structure of  the protein formed (see page 18).\nThis part is common \nto all amino acids and \nis just shown as a \nshaded rectangle in the examples below.general formula\nglycine cysteineN HR\nH HCC OH\nO\nHC H2SH\n \n\u25b2 fig A  Some differ ent amino acids.

Both of  these environmental factors are common \nin Middle Eastern countries. Biological molecules have an amazing number of  different roles in living organisms, including some you would not expect. In this activity, you will discover how current research shows that the disaccharide trehalose can protect proteins from damage in stressful conditions. This property is being used to make dry eyes more comfortable \u2013 and possibly protect the brain from the damage that can result from ageing.\nMEDICAL JOURNAL ARTICLE\nAbstract\nTrehalose is a naturally occurring disaccharide comprising \ntwo molecules of glucose. The sugar is widespread in many species of plants and animals, where its function appears to be to protect cells against desiccation, but it is not found in mammals. Trehalose has the ability to protect cellular membranes and labile proteins against damage and denaturation as a result of desiccation and oxidative stress. Trehalose appears to be the most effective sugar for protection against desiccation. Although the exact mechanism by which trehalose protects labile macromolecules and lipid membranes is unknown, credible hypotheses do exist. As well as being used in large quantities in the food industry, trehalose is used in the biopharmaceutical preservation of labile protein drugs and in the cryopreservation of human cells. Trehalose is under investigation for a number of medical applications, including the treatment of Huntington\u2019s chorea [disease] and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Recent studies have shown that trehalose can also prevent damage to mammalian eyes caused by desiccation and oxidative insult. These unique properties of trehalose have thus prompted its investigation as a component in treatment for dry eye syndrome. This interesting and unique disaccharide appears to have properties which may be exploited in ophthalmology and other disease states.\nTrehalose, a naturally occurring alpha-linked disaccharide \nformed of two molecules of glucose ( fig A) \u2026 is synthesized \nby many living organisms, including insects, plants, fungi, and micro-organisms as a response to prolonged periods of desiccation. This very useful property, known as anhydrobiosis, confers on an organism the ability to survive almost complete dehydration for prolonged periods and subsequently reanimate.HO\nHO OH HO OHHO OOOH\nOHO\nfig A  Structur e of trehalose; Registry number: 99-20-7; Molar mass: 342.296 \ng\/mol (anhydrous); 378.33 g\/mol (dihydrate); molecular structure: \n\u03b1-D-glucopyranosyl \u03b1-D-glucopyranoside (\u03b1,\u03b1-trehalose)\nReferences\n1\n Iturriaga G., Su\u00e1rez R., Nova-Franco B. \nTrehalose \nmetabolism: From osmoprotection to signaling.

We do not expect doctors to be able to do the same for our bodies. But they can do a lot to replace or repair the various parts of the circulatory system. The heart can have new valves, new blood vessels to supply the muscle and can even be replaced in a transplant. The blood vessels can be opened up, unblocked or replaced with grafts from other healthy areas of the body. Blood can be replaced by transfusions, and the bone marrow that makes the blood cells can be replaced by transplants. Doctors have even developed techniques by which they can operate on the circulatory system of a fetus in the uterus, to give blood transfusions or repair some heart conditions long before birth.\nIn this chapter, you will be looking at mammalian transport systems. This involves studying the general \nprinciples of circulatory systems and why larger organisms need a complex circulatory system.

This is made up of  a series of  vessels with the heart as a pump to move blood through the vessels. The blood is the transport medium and its passage through the vessels is called the circulation. The system delivers the materials needed by the cells of  the body, and carries away the waste products of  their metabolism. Substances move between the plasma or red blood cells and the body cells by diffusion or by active transport (see Section 2A.4). The tiniest blood vessels have walls only one cell thick, so diffusion distances are short and substances pass easily across these into other cells. Every cell in the body is near one of  these small vessels. The blood also carries out other functions, such as carrying hormones (chemical messages) from one part of  the body to another, forming part of  the defence system of  the body and distributing heat.\nTHE COMPONENTS OF THE BLOOD AND THEIR \nMAIN FUNCTIONS\nY ou are going to study all three parts of  the cardiovascular \nsystem, starting with the transport medium \u2013 the blood. Y our blood is a complex mixture carrying a wide variety of  cells and substances to all areas of  your body (see fig A).\nred blood\ncellplateletplasma\nwhitebloodcell\n\u25b2 fig A  T his light micrograph shows red blood cells, white blood cells  \nand platelets.LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n \u25fcUnder stand the role of haemoglobin in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide.\n \u25fcUnder\nstand the oxygen dissociation curve of haemoglobin, the Bohr effect and the significance of the oxygen affinity \nof fetal haemoglobin compared with adult haemoglobin.\n \u25fcUnder\nstand the blood clotting process.\nPLASMA\nY our blood plasma is the fluid part of  your mass transport system. \nOver 50% of  your blood volume is plasma, and it carries all of  your blood cells and everything else that needs transporting around your body. This includes:\n \u2022dig\nested food products (e.g. glucose and amino acids) from the \nsmall intestine to the liver and then to all the parts of  the body where they are needed either for immediate use or storage\n \u2022nutrient molecules fr\nom storage areas to the cells that need \nthem\n \u2022e\nxcretory products (e.g. carbon dioxide and urea) from cells to \nthe organs such as the lungs or kidneys that excrete them from the body\n \u2022chemical messa\nges (hormones) from where they are made to \nwhere they cause changes in the body.\nThe plasma helps to maintain a steady body temperature by transferring heat around the system from internal organs (e.g. the gut) or very active tissues (e.g. leg muscles in someone running) to the skin, where it can be lost to the surroundings. It also acts as a buffer to regulate pH changes.\nERYTHROCYTES (RED BLOOD CELLS)\nThere are approximately 5 million erythrocytes per mm3 of  blood \n(4\u20135 million per mm3 in women, 5\u20136\u00a0million per mm3 in men). \nThey contain haemoglobin, a red pigment that carries oxygen and gives them their colour (see Section 1A.5). They are made in the bone marrow. Mature erythrocytes do not contain a nucleus and have a limited life of  about 120 days.\nThe erythrocytes transport oxygen from the lungs to all the cells. \nThey are well adapted for their function. The biconcave disc shape of  the cells means that they have a large surface area to volume ratio, so oxygen can diffuse into and out of  them rapidly (see fig B). Having no nucleus leaves much more space inside the cells for the haemoglobin molecules that carry the oxygen. In fact, each red blood cell contains around 250\u2013300\u00a0million molecules of  haemoglobin and can carry approximately 1000\u00a0million molecules of  oxygen. Haemoglobin also carries some of  the carbon dioxide produced in respiration back to the lungs. The rest is transported in the plasma.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

The sounds are not made by the contracting of  the heart muscle but by the heart valves closing. The two sounds of  a heartbeat are often described as \u2018lub-dub\u2019. The first sound (\u2018lub\u2019) comes when the ventricles contract and the blood is forced against the atrioventricular valves. The second sound (\u2018dub\u2019) comes when the ventricles relax and a backflow of  blood hits the semilunar valves in the pulmonary artery and aorta. The rate of  your heartbeat shows how frequently your heart is contracting.\nTHE CARDIAC CYCLE\nY our heart is continuously contracting then relaxing. The contraction of  the heart is called systole. Systole can be divided into atrial systole, when the atria contract together forcing blood into the ventricles, and ventricular systole, when the ventricles contract. Ventricular systole happens about 0.13 seconds after atrial systole, and forces blood out of  the ventricles into the pulmonary artery and the aorta. Between contractions the heart relaxes and fills with blood. This relaxation stage is called diastole. One cycle of  systole and diastole makes up a single heartbeat, which lasts about 0.8\u00a0seconds in humans. This is known as the cardiac cycle (see fig D).

World Health Organization (WHO) data from 2017 show that cardiovascular diseases were responsible for 31% of  all global deaths \u2013 it is the single biggest cause of  death and disability (see fig A). What is more, around a third of  these deaths were in people younger than 70.\nMany cardiovascular diseases are linked to a condition called atherosclerosis.\nATHEROSCLEROSIS\nAtherosclerosis, a hardening of  the arteries, is a disease in which plaques (made of  a yellowish fatty \nsubstance) build up on the inside of  arteries. It can begin in late childhood and continues throughout life. A plaque can continue to develop until it restricts the flow of  blood through the artery or even blocks it completely. Plaques are most likely to form in the arteries of  the heart (coronary arteries) and neck (carotid arteries). The typical development of  a plaque is summarised in fig B.\nartery walls\nSlight damage to the endothelial cells lining\nthe artery leads to an in\ufb02ammatory response,followed by a build-up of cholestero l.smooth normalendothelium\nThe fatty deposits grow to form an atheroma.\nFibrous tissue and calcium salts build up ar\nound\nthe atheroma forming a hardened plaque which\nnarrows the artery and makes the walls rigid.\n\u25b2 fig B  T he development of atherosclerosis \nWe can now look at this development in more detail. Atherosclerosis begins with damage to the \nendothelial lining of  blood vessels. This damage can be caused by several factors, including high blood pressure and substances in tobacco smoke. Atherosclerosis usually occurs in arteries rather than in veins. This is because the blood in the arteries flows fast under relatively high pressure, which puts more strain on the endothelial lining of  the vessels and can cause small areas of  damage. In the veins, the pressure is lower so damage to the endothelium is much less likely.cardiovascular diseases\n31%\n27%9%33%communicable (infectious)\ndiseases, childbirth andnutritional conditions \ninjuries\nall other causes\ncardiovascular diseases\n31%\n27%9%33%communicable (infectious)\ndiseases, childbirth andnutritional conditions \ninjuries\nall other causes\n\u25b2 fig A  T his WHO data from 2017 \nshows cardiovascular disease is the biggest single cause of death around the world.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that damage to the \nendothelium occurs first and this is often caused by high blood pressure, often as a result of smoking.\nEXAM HINT\nLearn the stages of the development of atherosclerosis: damage to the endothelium of the arteries \u2192 inflammatory response \u2192 accumulation of cholesterol \u2192 atheroma \u2192 fibrous tissue\/calcium salts \u2192 plaque \u2192 narrowing\/loss of elasticity of the artery.1.11 1.10\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

One fifth of people spend at least one hour a day relaxing online. Compare that to only 4.6% who prefer to play sport and only 2.2% who prefer outdoor pursuits. Over 35% of people eat out nearly every day. People enjoy an affluent lifestyle \u2013 eating well, using a car instead of walking, relaxing at home or spending time with family and friends. Unfortunately, many people do not realise that these are also risk factors that increase the probability that they will develop a serious disease of the heart or blood vessels.\nIn this topic, you will learn about the meaning of risk and how we perceive risk. Cardiovascular diseases are \nthose of the heart and blood vessels. You will learn how we can determine what causes cardiovascular diseases and what increases the chances of us developing such diseases.

Some of  these diseases \naffect you randomly \u2013 there is nothing you can do to change whether you are affected or not. However, for many diseases, especially non-communicable (non-infectious) conditions such as heart disease \nand cancer, you can increase or lower your risk of  becoming ill, based on factors in your lifestyle. If  you understand the risk factors, you can help to make yourself  and your family healthier.\nWHAT IS RISK?\nThe word risk is used regularly in everyday conversation, but in science it has a very specific meaning. In science, risk describes the probability that an event will happen. Probability means the chance or likelihood of  the event, calculated mathematically. For example, imagine you have six coloured balls \u2013 red, blue, green, yellow, orange and purple \u2013 in a black cloth bag (see fig A). If  you reach in and pull out a single ball, the probability (risk) of  getting, say, a green ball can be expressed in one of  three ways:\n \u20221 in 6\n \u20220.166\n 66 r\necurring (0.17)\n \u202217%.\nT\nhis is the case for any one of  the six colours in the bag. In the same way, it is possible to work out \nyour risk of  developing certain specified diseases or of  dying from a specified cause. \nHOW DO WE PERCEIVE RISK? \nThe actual risk of  doing something is not always the same as the sense of  risk one feels. Most people don\u2019t think twice before getting into their car \u2013 but globally you have an annual risk of  1 in 5747 of  being killed in a road traffic accident. On the other hand, many people get very worried before flying, but commercial flights have a 1 in 4.5\u20135.5\u00a0million risk of  crashing. Personal perception of  risk is based on a variety of  factors which include: \n \u2022ho\nw familiar you are with the activity \n \u2022ho\nw much you enjoy the activity\n \u2022w\nhether or not you approve of  the activity. \nThe actual mathematical risk may play very little part in developing your personal perception of  risk. People often overestimate the benefits, or minimise the risk, of  behaviour that they want to continue. For example, there is now strong evidence from around the world that obesity is linked to a range of  diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers. However, people like eating and so they still become overweight. On the other hand, they will over-emphasise the risks of  activities if  they want to avoid them or prevent others from doing them. For example, parents over-emphasise the risk of  wandering away to small children, to help make the child behave and stay close.\nIn another example, there is good scientific evidence that smoking affects our risk of  developing \ndiseases such as atherosclerosis, as well as lung cancer. However, knowledge of  the mathematical risk of  an early death if  you smoke cigarettes doesn\u2019t always stop people from smoking.\u25b2 fig A  T he risk, chance or \nprobability that you will pick a blue ball out of the black bag is 1 in 6. If\u00a0you return the ball to the bag each time, you will have exactly the same probability of picking a blue ball again the next time. The probability will always be 1\u00a0in 6.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Eat fruit and vegetables, drink orange juice, take lots of  exercise, enjoy these foods \u2013 how do we know which advice is based on good science, and which is given to us because someone wants to sell us something? There are many ways in which you can evaluate the design of  studies to decide if  the data are meaningful.\nDESIGNING STUDIES\nMost epidemiological studies are based on a very big sample size \u2013 usually, the bigger the study, the more meaningful the results. \nThe ideal is to investigate one factor or variable, keeping all other \nvariables the same (controlled). However, controlling variables is almost impossible when you are working with human beings. The way people live is complex and varies a lot, so it is hard to detect how any one factor affects people. When a larger number of  people are studied, it is more likely that patterns may emerge, even with all the other differences between the people involved. Evidence based on large amounts of  data is more likely to be statistically significant than evidence based on small studies.\nSome epidemiological studies are carried out over a long time. \nThese longitudinal studies are very valuable because they follow the same group of  individuals over many years (see fig\u00a0A). This means the impact of  their known lifestyle on their health can be tracked over time. For example, the M\u00fcnster Heart Study looked at cardiovascular disease in 10\n 856 men a\nged 36\u201365 in \nEurope, following them from the start of  the study well into the 21st century. The results from this study are still seen as important because so many people were involved over a long period of  time. The Framingham Study in the US also provided much data \u2013 but was limited because they were all from similar American citizens. The study started in 1948 and it is still going on \u2013 the scientists have widened the population they gather data from, so it is more relevant now.\nAn ambitious new study called the National Children\u2019s Study has \nbeen set up in the US to follow 100\n 000 childr\nen from birth until \nthey are 21 years old. From 2008\u20132012, children were selected to be representative of  the whole of  the US population. One major objective of  the study is to examine how environmental inputs and genetic factors interact to affect the health and development of  children. This is believed to be the biggest longitudinal study ever set up. Similarly, the UAE Healthy Future Study will be longitudinal, looking at the same group of  volunteers over a number of  years.\nSometimes, scientists look at all the available studies in a subject \narea and analyse the available data in a massive literature study. This combines small and large studies and can give more reliable evidence than any one of  the studies alone. This is called a metadata analysis (meta-analysis).\nEVALUATING SCIENTIFIC STUDIES\nWhen considering a study, you need to examine the methodology to see if  it is valid. That means that it is properly designed to answer the question or questions being asked. Y ou also need to see if  the measurements have been carried out with precision. It is important to find out if  other scientists have been able to repeat the methodology and have had similar results \u2013 if  so, the results are considered more reliable.\nIt is also important to know who carried out the research, who \nfunded it and where it was published. Then to decide whether or not any of  these factors might have affected or biased the study. Y ou need to evaluate the data and conclusions from the study in the light of  all these factors.\nEXAM HINT\nRemember the meaning of the following terms.\nValid: answers the question the scientists are askingPrecise: measurements with little difference between themReliable: the investigation is repeatable by other scientists who get \nsimilar results\nThey are important in evaluating all practical work and research.\nIn the next few pages, you are going to look at some of  the \nevidence that scientists have collected suggesting factors that may \u2013 or may not \u2013 affect your risk of  developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In each case, you need to look carefully at the type of  evidence that is presented and think about what else you need to know to make firm conclusions.\nRISK FACTORS FOR CVDs\nThe results from many epidemiological studies have identified a range of  risk factors linked to CVDs. These factors divide into two main groups \u2013 those you can\u2019t change and those you can do something about (see Section 1C.3).\nNON-MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS FOR ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nThere are three main risk factors for CVDs which cannot (at the present time) be changed.\n \u2022Genes\n: studies show that there is a genetic tendency (trend) \nin some families, and also in some ethnic groups, to develop CVDs.

Y our lifestyle can affect your \nrisk of  developing atherosclerosis in the future. Epidemiological studies have shown links with smoking, diet and weight, lack of  activity and high blood pressure. These are the factors we can change, so we can change our risk of  developing CVDs by the lifestyle choices we make.\nSMOKING AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nStudies have shown that smokers are far more likely to develop atherosclerosis than non-smokers with a similar lifestyle. Nine out of  ten people who need heart bypass surgery or stents as a result of  atherosclerosis are smokers. In 2007, a Spanish study showed a clear correlation between smoking and the incidence of  death from atherosclerotic heart disease. Causation was established by further research. For example, studies found that the substances in tobacco smoke:\n \u2022can dama\nge the artery linings, which makes the build-up of  plaques more likely\n \u2022can cause the ar\nteries to narrow, raise the blood pressure and increase the risk of  atherosclerosis.\nSimilar findings were made in a study on adults with heart disease in Jordan in 2017 (see fig B).1.16 1.12\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Lots of  studies show that eating lots of  fruit and vegetables \nbenefits your health in many ways \u2013 including reducing your risk of  developing CVDs. The graph in fig A is one piece of  evidence which shows how eating five or more portions of  fruit or vegetables a day can lower your risk of  having a heart attack. It was based on data from a longitudinal study of  more than 84\n 000 w\nomen and 42\n 000 men o\nver eight years, looking at their fruit and vegetable intake \nand cardiac health. \n00.20.40.60.81.01.2Relative risk of coronary\nheart disease\n4.0\u20134.9 5.0\u20135.9 <3.0 3.0\u20133.9\nFruit and vegetable intake (servings per day)6.0\u20136.9 \u22657.0\n\u25b2 fig A  T his graph shows the impact of eating increasing amounts of fruit and vegetables on the risk for coronary \nheart disease.\nANTIOXIDANTS AND HEART HEALTH\nHowever, as you know, it isn\u2019t enough to show a correlation between two things. We need to show \nhow one thing causes another and we still don\u2019t really know how fruit and vegetables have their effect. They are very varied in their chemistry. For some time, it was thought that the antioxidants found in fruit and vegetables might be the answer. Vitamins, such as vitamin A found in carrots, vitamin C from citrus fruits and vitamin E from leafy green vegetables, almonds and sunflower oil, are antioxidants and they are found in fruits and vegetables. Several studies appeared to show that antioxidants were the answer and many people started taking antioxidant supplements to protect their hearts. However, recent studies, including some very large metadata analyses (studies where scientists have looked at the results of  many different investigations), have shown that the evidence for antioxidants being good for your heart is inconclusive. There is some evidence that some antioxidants may cause harm.\nVITAMIN C: A CASE STUDY\nVitamin C is important in the formation of  connective tissue in the body, such as in the bones, teeth, skin and many internal body surfaces including the endothelial lining of  blood vessels. A severe lack of  vitamin C in the diet causes scurvy, which can result in bleeding gums, bruising easily and painful joints. As you have seen, if  the lining of  an artery is damaged, atherosclerosis is more likely to develop. So, it makes sense, in theory, that if  your diet is low in vitamin C, your arteries are more likely to be damaged and you are more likely to be affected by CVD. \nA study published in the British Medical Journal in 1997 looked at the association between \nconcentration of  vitamin C in the blood and risk of  heart attack in 1605 men from eastern Finland. The men had no sign of  coronary artery disease when they were tested between 1984 and 1989. Their vitamin C levels were also tested. Between 1984 and 1992 a total 70 of  the men had a heart EXAM HINT\nRemember to look closely at \nthe data you are given.

Why do they do this? \nPREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE \nCardiovascular disease has a negative effect on individuals, on families  and on society. It costs a lot of  money to treat people in hospital. When  people are too ill to work, they are losing money for their families, and  also for the companies where they work. Treating people with drugs to  prevent them from needing surgery is cheaper for health service providers.  It is even cheaper (and better for the individual) if  we can stop ourselves  needing the drugs. So, prevention is better than treatment for CVDs for  many reasons (see fig A). However, persuading people to change their  \nlifestyle habits is often difficult.\nFor example, there is a lot of  reliable evidence to show that smoking is  \none of  the highest risk factors for CVDs. However, if  you stop smoking,  your risk of  developing heart disease is almost halved after just one year.  Moreover, research carried out by a team led by Azra Mahmud from  Trinity College Dublin and published in 2007 suggests that after 10 years,  the arteries of  smokers who stop smoking are the same as if  they had  never smoked. There is a lot of  support available for people who want to  stop smoking. Y et, despite all this, almost 1 billion people around the  world smoke cigarettes and millions of  them die each year of  CVDs and  cancers linked to their smoking. \nHealth education programmes in schools and communities can help to  \nmake sure that everyone is aware of  the risks associated with different  lifestyle choices. However, each individual has to make their own choices  and take their own risks.\nOVERWEIGHT OR UNDERFIT?\nMost people are aware that obesity is linked to CVDs, and many go on  slimming diets to try to lose weight. Most people also know that taking  regular exercise helps protect against CVDs \u2013 but more people choose to  go on a diet than choose to take regular exercise. The results of  a study  carried out over an average of  eight years on 20\n 000 men a\nged from  \n30 to 83 years are given in Section 1C.4 fig\u00a0B. Fitness was defined by  how much oxygen they used during exercise. The results show that if  you  are obese and fit you have a lower risk of  dying from CVDs than someone  who is not obese but unfit. Obviously, being the correct weight and fit is  best of  all! \nThe problem is that many people enjoy their food, and don\u2019t take sufficient exercise. It takes a lot of  \neffort to cut down the amount of  food you eat and change to eating healthier foods including lots of  fruit and vegetables. \u25b2\n fig A  Infogr aphics like this one published in Gulf News help \npeople understand the factors which affect their heart health.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember to read all the \ninformation in graphics.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Here are two examples.\nWarfarin is an anticoagulant that interferes with the \nmanufacture of  prothrombin in the body. Low prothrombin levels make the blood clot less easily (see Section 1B.2). Warfarin has been used in rat poison \u2013 in high doses the blood will not clot at all and the rats bleed to death after the slightest injury. In humans, the dose is carefully monitored to make sure that the clotting of  the blood is reduced but not prevented completely. \nPlatelet inhibitory drugs make the platelets less sticky, and \nso reduce the clotting ability of  the blood. The cheapest and most common of  these is aspirin (fig D) but clopidogrel is also commonly used. \n\u25b2 fig D  Aspirin is a r elatively cheap drug. It has been used traditionally  \nas a painkiller. It is also a very effective way of preventing many \ncardiovascular problems.\nThe risks of  taking aspirin are well known \u2013 it irritates the \nstomach lining and causes bleeding in the stomach which can become serious. A combination of  aspirin and clopidogrel can reduce the risk of  developing a range of  cardiovascular diseases by 20\u201325% in some low-risk patients. However, based on data from several studies it appears that, for some patients, the risk of  side-effects is much higher when the two drugs are combined. For example, for every 1000 patients at high risk of  CVDs treated for 28 months, five cardiovascular events would be avoided \u2013 but three major stomach bleeds would be caused. In lower-risk patients, 23 cardiovascular events would be avoided while 10 major bleeds would be caused. It is difficult to achieve the correct balance between preventing the blood from clotting too easily while allowing it to clot when necessary. For example, when people are treated with anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin, they must be monitored very carefully to make sure that they do not bleed internally, particularly in the brain. The decision whether to give warfarin will depend on many factors, including the patient\u2019s age and condition as well as other medication they may be taking.\nCHECKPOINT \n1.
