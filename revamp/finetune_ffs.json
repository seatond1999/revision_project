All sugars can be classified as reducing or non-reducing. The Benedict's test tests for sugars \u2014 it differs depending on the type of sugar you are testing for.1)2)3)Reducing sugars include all monosaccharides (e.g. glucose) and some disaccharides (e.g. maltose and lactose).You add Benedict's reagent (which is blue) to a sample and heat it in a water bath that's been brought to the boil.If the test's positive it will form a coloured precipitate (solid particles suspended in the solution).The colour of the precipitate changes from:blue-\u00a3> green>=>-yellowH>orange=4> brick redr Alwars us\u00ab an excess of r Z Benedict's solution \u2014 ;Z thls mak\u00ab sure that all ~ Z the sugar reacts. z1 1 1 \" I I I I I I M M | | | V\\N4)The higher the concentration of reducing sugar, the further the colour change goes \u2014 you can use this to compare the amount of reducing sugar in different solutions. A more accurate way of doing this is to filter the solution and weigh the precipitate.C\/1d\u00a3<UD1X1UZuDOLUIzO1) If the result of the reducing sugars test is negative, there could still be a non-reducing sugar present. To test for non-reducing sugars, like sucrose, first you have to break them down into monosaccharides.2) You do this by getting a new sample of the test solution, adding dilute hydrochloric acid and carefully heating it in a water bath that's been brought to the boil. You then neutralise it with sodium hydrogencarbonate. Then just carry out the Benedict's test as you would for a reducing sugar.3) If the test's positive it will form a coloured precipitate (as for the reducing sugars test). If the test's negative the solution will stay blue, which means it doesn't contain any sugar (either reducing or non-reducing).Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","2":"25Eukaryotic Cells and OrganellesDifferent Organelles have Different FunctionsThis giant table contains a big list of organelles \u2014 you need to know the structure and function of them all.

Since \nsetting up the business called Health and Beauty for You \nwith her brother, Will, they had managed to keep the \nbusiness going through three very di ff icult years. When \nthey set the business up, they agreed that their first \nobjective was survival at all costs. Despite the country\u2019s \neconomic di ff iculties and some fierce competition, the \nbusiness had built up a good customer base and had \ncovered all of its costs for the first three years. Now the \npair had decided to plan for the next three years and \nthe first stage of this was to agree on new objectives for \nthe business. June wanted the business to grow and \nshe thought the best way to do this was to buy another \nbeauty salon in another area of the city. \u2018This will get \nthe business name really well-known and will give us \nthe basis for further sales growth of at least 20% a year,\u2019 \nshe told Will. He was not so sure he wanted the sta ff i n g \nand marketing problems associated with another salon. \n\u2018I\u00a0think we should aim to make as much profit as we can from the existing salon. I think we could aim for a profit of \n$40,000 per year. We could o ff er a wider range of services \nand increase our prices. A ft er  a l l,  w e  w en t  i n t o  b u s i n ess \nwith the intention of becoming rich!\u2019 he reminded June.\nAft er much argument, the pair agreed that the \nnew business objective should be, in the short term, \nto open a new salon and to double sales within three \nyears. A ft er this had been achieved, the aim should be \nto maximise long-term profits from the two locations \nby improving image and raising prices \u00a0\u2013 Will thought a \nfive-year target of $90,000 per year was realistic.\nPoints to think about:\n\u25a0 W h a t  d o  y o u  u n d e r s t a n d  b y  t h e  t e r m  \u2018 o b j e c t i v e \u2019 ?\n\u25a0 Do you think it is important that Health and Beauty for You \nshould have clear objectives? Explain your answer with as \nmany reasons as you can.\n\u25a0 Why do you think June and Will are thinking of changing \nthe objectives for their business over time?\nIntroduction\nBusinesses of any size can bene fi t from having clear \nobjectives or targets to work towards. In small sole-\ntrader businesses, these objectives are o ft en not written \ndown or formalised in any way, but the owners will o ft en \nhave a clear idea of what they are trying to achieve. In \npartnership organisations, it is important for partners \nto agree on the direction their business should take or \nfuture disagreements can cause much time to be wasted \nthat would be better spent on running the business \neff ectively. Limited companies must state the overall 38review the success of business activity. In addition, \nfor any aim to be successfully achieved, there has \nto be an appropriate strategy \u00a0\u2013 or detailed plan of \naction \u00a0\u2013 in place to ensure that resources are correctly \ndirected towards the fi nal goal. Th i s  s t r a t e g y  s h o u l d  \nbe constantly \u00a0reviewed to check whether the business \nis on target to achieve its objectives. Both the aims of \nan organisation and the strategies it adopts will o ft en \nchange over time. Indeed, a change of objective will \nalmost certainly require a change of plan too. A poor \nplan or strategy will lead to failure to reach the target \n(Unit 6  focuses on how businesses develop strategies to \nmeet their objectives).\nTh e most e ff ective business objectives usually meet the \nfollowing \u2018SMART\u2019 criteria:\nS\u00a0\u2013 Specific:  Objectives should focus on what the business \ndoes and should apply directly to that business. A hotel may set \nan objective of 75% bed occupancy over the winter period. This \nobjective is specific to this business.\nM\u00a0\u2013 Measurable:  O b j e c t i v e s  t h a t  h a v e  a  q u a n t i t a t i v e  v a l u e  a r e  \nlikely to prove to be more e ff ective targets for directors and \nstaff  to work towards. For instance, to increase sales in the \nsouth-east region by 15% this year.\nA\u00a0\u2013 Achievable:  Setting objectives that are almost impossible \nin the time frame given will be pointless. They will demotivate \nstaff  who have the task of trying to reach these targets. So \nobjectives should be achievable.\nR\u00a0\u2013 Realistic and relevant:  O b j e c t i v e s  s h o u l d  b e  r e a l i s t i c  w h e n  \ncompared with the resources of the company and should be \nexpressed in terms relevant to the people who have to carry \nthem out. So informing a factory cleaner about \u2018increasing \nmarket share\u2019 is less relevant than a target of reducing usage of \ncleaning materials by 20%.\nT\u00a0\u2013 Time-specific:  A time limit should be set when an objective \nis established \u00a0\u2013 by when does the business expect to increase \nprofits by 5%? Without a time limit, it will be impossible to \nassess whether the objective has actually been met.\nTOP TIP\nRemember the slogan: SMART.\nAims, mission statements, objectives and \nstrategies \u00a0\u2013 what do they all mean?\nTh e links between these concepts can be made clearer by \nstudying this \u2018hierarchy of objectives\u2019 ( Figure 4.1), which \nshows, visually, the balance and dependencies between the \ndiff erent stages in the setting of aims and objectives. Later \nin this chapter we will consider the importance of these \nobjectives to business strategies.Corporate aims\nTh ese are the very long-term goals that a business hopes \nto achieve. Th e core central purpose of a business\u2019s \nactivity is expressed in its corporate aims. Sole traders \nand partnerships \u00a0\u2013 not just companies \u00a0\u2013 will also \ncommonly develop the same kind of long-term vision for \ntheir \u00a0business.\nTh e case study demonstrates a typical corporate \naim. Daimler Mercedes-Benz tells us that it aims to \nachieve pro fi table growth by continuing to play a leading \nrole in the automobile industry. Other corporate aims \ntend to concentrate on customer-based goals \u00a0\u2013 such as \n\u2018meeting customers\u2019 needs\u2019 \u00a0\u2013 or market-based goals \u00a0\u2013 \nsuch as \u2018becoming the world leader\u2019.

This means \nthat between 100 and 1000 bacteria will fit in a straight line in 1 mm. \nGroups of bacterial cells, called colonies, are shown in Figure 1.2. Many, but not all, scientists think that prokaryotes evolved before eukaryotes and \nso are missing some cell components that eukaryotic cells possess. These \nscientists think that prokaryotes first appeared about 3.5 billion years ago, \nwhich is only one billion years after the Earth\u2019s crust formed.\nIf the last 4.6 billion years were scaled down into an hour, Figure 1.3 \nshows when the first prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms are likely to \nhave evolved.

It is mainly water and it holds other \ncomponents such as ribosomes. Here most of the chemical reactions in the cell happen (such as the making of proteins in ribosomes).\nCell wall Like those of plants and fungi, bacterial cells have a cell wall to provide support. However, unlike plant cell walls this is not made of cellulose. The cell membrane is found on the inside surface of the cell wall.\nSingle DNA loop (not in chromosomes)DNA in prokaryotes is not arranged in complex chromosomes  \nlike in eukaryotic cells.

They can be unicellular or belong \nto multicellular organisms. Eukaryotic cells almost always have a \nnucleus and are generally larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells.\nThe structure of a generalised animal cell is shown in Figure 1.6. \nA generalised cell is one that has been simplified to make the key \ncomponents easier to identify.\n\u25b2 Figure 1.6 A generalised animal cell as seen with a microscope (magnified \u00d74800) \nand as three- and two-dimensional diagrams.\nComponents of animal cells\nIn the previous section we looked at bacterial cells. Animal cells have \nmany components in common with these. The cytoplasm of animal cells \nis also mainly water and it holds other components such as ribosomes. \nIn the cytoplasm most of the chemical reactions in the cell happen \n(such as the making of proteins in ribosomes).\nThe cell-surface membrane of animal cells also surrounds the cell. There \nare no cell walls in animal cells and so the membrane is on the outside \nof these cells. The membrane controls what substances go in and out of \nthe cell. Many cells need glucose and oxygen for respiration, and these \nsubstances move by diffusion into the cell from the blood, where it is \nfound at a higher concentration. Carbon dioxide moves back into the \nblood capillaries through the membrane.\nMitochondria are small organelles found in the cytoplasm and are \nonly present in eukaryotic cells. They are the site of most of a cell\u2019s \nrespiration. Here the energy stored in glucose is released for the cell \nto complete the seven life processes. Without this energy all cells die. \nMore-active cells such as those in muscles or sperm cells usually have \nmore mitochondria because these cells need more energy. Mitochondria \nhave many folds inside them, which make their surface area very large \nto increase the rate at which energy is released.\nRibosomes are the site of protein synthesis. These organelles are \npresent in the cytoplasm of animal cells.\nKEy TERM\nDiffusion  The net movement \nof particles from an area of high \nconcentration to an area of lower concentration.\nnucleuscell surface\nmembrane\ncytoplasmmitochondria\nribosomes\nAnimal and plant cells\n11Animal cells are unlike bacterial cells in that they usually possess a \nnucleus. This component is present in almost all eukaryotic cells. It is \nfound in the cytoplasm and is surrounded by its own membrane. The \ncell\u2019s genetic material (DNA) is enclosed within it, arranged into shapes \ncalled chromosomes. (Red blood cells do not have a nucleus, so they \nhave more room to absorb and carry the maximum amount of oxygen, \nwhich is their main function.)\nHumans are of course classified as animals. Many of our cells are like \nother animal cells.\n\u25cf\u25cfGeneralised plant cells\nLike those belonging to animals, plant cells are eukaryotic. This means that \nthey may belong to single-celled or multicellular organisms, they do have a \nnucleus and they are generally larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells.\n\u25b2 Figure 1.7 A generalised plant cell as seen with a microscope (magnified \u00d72800) \nand as three- and two-dimensional diagrams.\nComponents of plant cells\nPlant cells have many components in common with animal cells, \nincluding a nucleus in which the organism\u2019s genetic material (DNA) \nis found. Plant cells also possess ribosomes for protein synthesis and \nmitochondria for respiration in their cytoplasm.\nPlant cells possess some components not present in animal cells. \nChloroplasts are small components, full of a green pigment called \nchlorophyll which is necessary for photosynthesis to occur. This reaction \nuses light energy from the Sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into \nglucose and oxygen and so provides an energy source for the plant. It is \nthe green chlorophyll in plants that gives some of their parts their green \ncolour. Most roots are hidden from the Sun and so cannot photosynthesise. \nThey do not have chloroplasts and so are often white, not green.\nThere are huge numbers of chloroplasts in leaf cells. There are often \nwell over half a million per square millimetre of leaf.\nPlant cells also possess a cell wall, unlike animal cells. This is made \nfrom cellulose and provides structure for the cell. Plants would not be \nable to stand upright to catch light energy from the Sun without cell \nwalls.

We have developed specialised cells that have adaptations \nto allow them to complete specific functions. Red blood cells, for \nexample, have a biconcave shape (which dips in the middle on both \nsides) and no nucleus to maximise their surface area to absorb more \noxygen. Key specialised cells for animals and plants, together with their \nadaptations, are listed below.\n\u25cf\u25cfSperm cell\nIn humans, during a male orgasm about a teaspoon of semen is ejaculated. Within this are tens of millions of sperm cells, which must \nswim through the cervix and uterus to the fallopian tubes. Here one \ncell may fertilise an egg cell (ovum). Sperm cells have a tail to propel \nthem towards the ovum (Figure 1.10). They have a relatively large \nnumber of mitochondria to release the energy from glucose during \nrespiration. This is needed to keep them swimming. The nucleus of a \nhuman sperm contains the genetic material (DNA) of the father. This \nwill make up half of the DNA of the baby. At the front of a sperm is an \nacrosome. This contains digestive enzymes, which break down the outer \nlayer of the ovum, allowing the sperm to enter and fertilise it.\n\u25cf\u25cfNerve cell\nOur nervous system controls and coordinates all our actions. These \ncan be either voluntary actions (like picking up the television remote \ncontrol) or involuntary actions (like our heart beating faster when we \nexercise). There are two main parts to our nervous system. The first is \nour central nervous system (CNS), which is made up of our brain and \nspinal cord. The other is our peripheral nervous system (PNS), which is  \nall the other nerve cells that connect to the CNS but then spread out across the body. To control our actions, signals must be sent and received.

Their long extensions are called axons and these \nhave a myelin sheath surrounding much of their length (Figure 1.11). \nThis acts like the plastic coating on an electrical wire and insulates the \nelectrical impulse. The cell body of the nerve also has smaller extensions \ncalled dendrites, which allow it to pick up signals from neighbouring cells.\n\u25cf\u25cfMuscle cell\n\u25b2 Figure 1.13 The three types of muscle.\nThere are three types of muscle in our bodies, all of which can contract and relax. Smooth muscle contracts and relaxes automatically and \nis found in places such as the linings of the vessels that make up \nour circulatory system and the iris of our eyes. Cardiac muscle also \ncontracts and relaxes automatically and is found in our heart. The third \ntype is skeletal muscle, which is usually found attached to our bones. \nWe control the contractions of this type of muscle, so its movements \nare not automatic.\nAll three types of muscle are made from muscle cells (Figure 1.13). \nThese are long thin cells full of mitochondria. In the mitochondria the \nenergy from glucose is released during respiration. This energy allows \nthe muscle to keep on contracting.\n\u25cf\u25cfRoot hair cell\nRoot hair cells have a small thin extension, which pokes out into the soil (Figure 1.14). Many plants \nhave such high numbers of long root hairs that they \ncan look like a spider\u2019s web. The purpose of these \nhairs is to increase the surface area of the root that \nis in contact with the soil. This allows the plant to \nabsorb more water and minerals from the soil. A \nsingle rye plant has billions of root hairs, which have \na total length of hundreds of miles. Without these \nit is likely that the adult plant would not be able to \nabsorb enough water to survive.\nKEy TERMS\nAxon  The extension of a nerve cell \nalong which electrical impulses travel.\nMyelin sheath  The insulating cover \nalong an axon, which speeds up the \nelectrical impulse.\nTIP\nMake a model of a bacterial, plant or animal cell and label it with the cell components and their functions to \nhelp you remember them (Figure 1.12).\n\u25b2 Figure 1.12 A model of a eukaryotic \ncell made from sweets.skeletal muscle\nsmooth muscle\ncardiac muscle\nsoil particles\nroot hairwater and mineral\nions ar e absorbed\nnucleusvacuolecellulose\ncell wall\n\u25c0 Figure 1.14 The parts of a root hair cell.Cell specialisation\n15\u25cf\u25cfXylem cell\nXylem cells form long tubes running along the stem or trunk of plants. \nThey are strengthened by lignin fibres. They carry water and some \ndissolved minerals from the roots upwards to other parts of the plant. \nThis water evaporates and is lost from leaves as water vapour during \nthe continual process of transpiration. It is also used in the green \nparts of plants for photosynthesis during the day. Xylem tubes are made \nfrom lots of individual cells that have died. The ends of these cells \nerode away, leaving long tubes through which water is naturally drawn \nupwards (Figure 1.15). They have reinforced cell walls to support the \nweight of the plant.\n\u25cf\u25cfPhloem cell\nPhloem cells carry the glucose (as sucrose) made in photosynthesis from the leaves of a plant to all other parts of the plant in cell sap. This process \nis called translocation. The sugar is used immediately in respiration to \nrelease energy for the plant or is stored as starch in cells or particularly in structures such as the roots of \nvegetables. Unlike xylem, phloem cells are living. They \nhave fewer cell organelles than many other types of \ncell, which allows the sugar to travel easily. Connecting \nadjacent phloem cells are sieve plates. These have small \nholes to speed up translocation (Figure 1.16).\nPhloem cells are arranged with xylem cells to form \nbundles. These make up the veins you can see in a leaf (Figure 1.17).\n\u25c0 Figure 1.17 The veins of a leaf are made from xylem tubes \ntransporting water to the leaf and phloem tubes transporting sugars away from it.\nKEy TERMS\nPhloem  Living cells that carry sugars \nmade in photosynthesis to all cells of a plant.\nTranslocation  The movement of \nsugars made in photosynthesis from \nthe leaves of plants.\nOrganelle  A part of a cell with a \nspecific function.\nKEy TERMS\nXylem  Dead plant cells joined \ntogether into long tubes through which \nwater flows during transpiration.\nTranspiration  The gradual release of \nwater vapour from leaves to continue \nthe \u2018pull\u2019 of water up to them from the soil.\ntranspiration\nof water\ncompanion\ncell\ntranslocation\nof sucr ose\n\u25b2 Figure 1.15 The parts of a xylem \ntube.\u25b2 Figure 1.16 The parts of a phloem tube.1 Cell biology\n16\u25cf\u25cfCell differentiation\nThe previous two sections have looked at generalised and specialised \nanimal and plant cells. After generalised cells are formed they become \nspecialised as an organism develops. This process is called cell \ndifferentiation. Your cells did this while you were in your mother\u2019s \nuterus. Part of this process involves cells developing specific structures \nwithin them to allow them to function. For example, muscle cells need \nto release lots of energy during respiration and so require a high number \nof mitochondria. Unlike animal cells, most plant cells retain the ability \nto differentiate throughout their life. We would not be able to take plant \ncuttings without this. You will learn about this in Chapter 14.\nMicroscopy\nIt is not very easy to know who invented the first microscope or exactly when this happened. It is likely to have occurred in the 1590s in the \nNetherlands by makers of eye glasses. Seventy-five years later, in 1665, \nEnglish scientist Robert Hooke published a book called Micrographia, \nwhich was full of impressive images including a drawing of the eyes \nof a fly using a microscope. In this book he first used the word \u2018cell\u2019, \nbecause when he looked at plant cells using his microscope he was \nreminded of the cells in a honeycomb.\nA decade later, in the mid-1670s, a Dutch scientist called van \nLeeuwenhoek discovered sperm cells and then single-celled bacteria \nfrom a human mouth. This was a tremendously important development \nin science, because before this no one had ever seen a single-celled organism.

These \ncan be either voluntary actions (like picking up the television remote \ncontrol) or involuntary actions (like our heart beating faster when we \nexercise). There are two main parts to our nervous system. The first is \nour central nervous system (CNS), which is made up of our brain and \nspinal cord. The other is our peripheral nervous system (PNS), which is  \nall the other nerve cells that connect to the CNS but then spread out across the body. To control our actions, signals must be sent and received. These \nsignals are electrical impulses that travel along nerve cells.  acrosome\nnucleus\nmitochondria\ntail\nsynaptic knobdendrite\ncell surface\nmembraneaxon myelin sheath\n(insulator)nucleus synaptic knob\ncommunicating with\nanother nerve cell or\nan ef fector , e.g. muscle\nKEy TERM\nBiconcave  Used to describe a shape \nwith a dip that curves inwards on both \nsides.\nTIP\nIf you are asked to explain how a cell is adapted to its function, don\u2019t forget to use a connecting phrase like \u2018so that it \ncan\u2019 or \u2018to allow it to\u2019.\n\u25b2 Figure 1.10 The parts of a sperm cell.\n\u25b2 Figure 1.11 The parts of a nerve cell.1 Cell biology\n14To keep these signals moving quickly, some of our nerve cells are the \nlongest cells in our body. Their long extensions are called axons and these \nhave a myelin sheath surrounding much of their length (Figure 1.11). \nThis acts like the plastic coating on an electrical wire and insulates the \nelectrical impulse. The cell body of the nerve also has smaller extensions \ncalled dendrites, which allow it to pick up signals from neighbouring cells.\n\u25cf\u25cfMuscle cell\n\u25b2 Figure 1.13 The three types of muscle.\nThere are three types of muscle in our bodies, all of which can contract and relax. Smooth muscle contracts and relaxes automatically and \nis found in places such as the linings of the vessels that make up \nour circulatory system and the iris of our eyes. Cardiac muscle also \ncontracts and relaxes automatically and is found in our heart. The third \ntype is skeletal muscle, which is usually found attached to our bones. \nWe control the contractions of this type of muscle, so its movements \nare not automatic.\nAll three types of muscle are made from muscle cells (Figure 1.13). \nThese are long thin cells full of mitochondria. In the mitochondria the \nenergy from glucose is released during respiration. This energy allows \nthe muscle to keep on contracting.\n\u25cf\u25cfRoot hair cell\nRoot hair cells have a small thin extension, which pokes out into the soil (Figure 1.14). Many plants \nhave such high numbers of long root hairs that they \ncan look like a spider\u2019s web. The purpose of these \nhairs is to increase the surface area of the root that \nis in contact with the soil. This allows the plant to \nabsorb more water and minerals from the soil. A \nsingle rye plant has billions of root hairs, which have \na total length of hundreds of miles. Without these \nit is likely that the adult plant would not be able to \nabsorb enough water to survive.\nKEy TERMS\nAxon  The extension of a nerve cell \nalong which electrical impulses travel.\nMyelin sheath  The insulating cover \nalong an axon, which speeds up the \nelectrical impulse.\nTIP\nMake a model of a bacterial, plant or animal cell and label it with the cell components and their functions to \nhelp you remember them (Figure 1.12).\n\u25b2 Figure 1.12 A model of a eukaryotic \ncell made from sweets.skeletal muscle\nsmooth muscle\ncardiac muscle\nsoil particles\nroot hairwater and mineral\nions ar e absorbed\nnucleusvacuolecellulose\ncell wall\n\u25c0 Figure 1.14 The parts of a root hair cell.","10":"1 Cell biology\n16\u25cf\u25cfCell differentiation\nThe previous two sections have looked at generalised and specialised \nanimal and plant cells. After generalised cells are formed they become \nspecialised as an organism develops. This process is called cell \ndifferentiation. Your cells did this while you were in your mother\u2019s \nuterus. Part of this process involves cells developing specific structures \nwithin them to allow them to function. For example, muscle cells need \nto release lots of energy during respiration and so require a high number \nof mitochondria. Unlike animal cells, most plant cells retain the ability \nto differentiate throughout their life. We would not be able to take plant \ncuttings without this. You will learn about this in Chapter 14.\nMicroscopy\nIt is not very easy to know who invented the first microscope or exactly when this happened. It is likely to have occurred in the 1590s in the \nNetherlands by makers of eye glasses. Seventy-five years later, in 1665, \nEnglish scientist Robert Hooke published a book called Micrographia, \nwhich was full of impressive images including a drawing of the eyes \nof a fly using a microscope. In this book he first used the word \u2018cell\u2019, \nbecause when he looked at plant cells using his microscope he was \nreminded of the cells in a honeycomb.\nA decade later, in the mid-1670s, a Dutch scientist called van \nLeeuwenhoek discovered sperm cells and then single-celled bacteria \nfrom a human mouth. This was a tremendously important development \nin science, because before this no one had ever seen a single-celled organism.

But the thing they have in common is that they all use \nmagnifying lenses to enlarge images.\n\u25cf\u25cfLight microscopes\nThe parts of a light microscope and their functions are shown in Table 1.2.\nTable 1.2 The functions of the parts of a light microscope.\nPart Function\nEyepiece lens You will look through this lens to see your sample. This is often \u00d710.\nObjective lens Usually there are three to choose from (often \u00d75, \u00d710 and \u00d725). The \nsmallest will be the easiest to focus, so select this first. When you have focused this lens try a different one with a greater magnification.\nStage This holds the sample securely, often using two metal clips.\nSpecimen This is usually placed in a drop of water or stain on a microscope slide under a very thin glass cover slip.\nMirror This reflects the light up through the sample, and then the objective and eyepiece lenses into your eyes.\nCourse focus This quickly and easily moves the stage up and down to focus on the sample.\nFine focus This sensitively and slowly moves the stage up and down to allow you to make your image very sharp.\nThe total magnification of the image you are looking at is calculated by:\ntotal magnification =  magnification of \u00d7 magnification of  \n   eyepiece lens       objective lens\n\u25cf\u25cfElectron microscopes\nElectron microscopes use electrons in place of rays of light to \nmake an image (Figure 1.19). The wavelength of electrons can be \nup to 100 000 times smaller than that of visible light. This means \nthat electron microscopes can take images at significantly higher magnifications. The first electron microscope was made by German \nscientists Ernst Ruska (1906\u20131988) and Max Knoll (1897\u20131969) in \n1931. This was a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Several years \nlater, in 1937, German scientist Manfred von Ardenne (1907\u20131997) \ninvented a second type called a scanning electron microscope (SEM). \nKEy TERMS\nElectron microscope  A microscope \nthat uses electron beams in place of \nlight to give higher magnifications.\nElectron  Negatively charged, tiny \nsubatomic particle that is found in \nshells surrounding the nucleus of an atom.\nTIP\nCopy out the table headings in the first row and column and test yourself by filling in the rest of the table from \nmemory. This will help you remember \nthe processes.\n\u25b6 Figure 1.19 A large modern electron microscope.\n1 Cell biology\n18Transmission electron microscopes fire a large beam of electrons though \na very thin slice of the specimen. All electrons are fired at the same \ntime. Not all of the electrons pass though the specimen. The image is \nmade from only those electrons that do.\nScanning electron microscopes also use a beam of electrons. This beam \nis much smaller and scans across the whole image but not all at the \nsame time. Electrons scatter from the surface of the sample and are \ndetected to make an image.\nAs a consequence of their different methods of working, the images that \nthese two microscopes take are very different from each other. Images from \ntransmission electron microscopes are flat and are usually taken in cross-\nsection through a specimen. That is, they are frequently used to look at \na section through a cell. Scanning electron microscopes don\u2019t need thin \nsamples so can be used to take images that look more three-dimensional. \nAll electron microscope images are black and white. On occasions scientists \ncolour these images to make them look more striking (Figure 1.20).\nThe resolution of microscopes is defined as the shortest distance \nbetween two parts of a specimen that can be seen as two distinctly \nseparate points. As a result of the wavelength of light the maximum \nresolution of light microscopes is 200 nm. (There are one million \nnanometres (nm) in a millimetre.) The wavelength of electrons is shorter than that of light, and so much closer points can be resolved. \nAn electron microscope can resolve points up to 2000 times closer than \na light microscope, at a separation of just 0.1 nm.\nKEy TERM\nResolution  The smallest distance \nbetween two separate points.\nTest yourself\n13 State the range of magnification you might see in a light microscope.\n14 State the resolution of an electron microscope.\n15 Describe why electron microscopes have greater magnification.\n16 Describe a disadvantage of using an electron microscope.\nExplain why scanning electron \nmicroscopes can take images that look three-dimensional.Show you can...\n\u25b2 Figure 1.20 (a) A three-dimensional image of an ant\u2019s head taken with a scanning electron microscope.

They can be unicellular or belong \nto multicellular organisms. Eukaryotic cells almost always have a \nnucleus and are generally larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells.\nThe structure of a generalised animal cell is shown in Figure 1.6. \nA generalised cell is one that has been simplified to make the key \ncomponents easier to identify.\n\u25b2 Figure 1.6 A generalised animal cell as seen with a microscope (magnified \u00d74800) \nand as three- and two-dimensional diagrams.\nComponents of animal cells\nIn the previous section we looked at bacterial cells. Animal cells have \nmany components in common with these. The cytoplasm of animal cells \nis also mainly water and it holds other components such as ribosomes. \nIn the cytoplasm most of the chemical reactions in the cell happen \n(such as the making of proteins in ribosomes).\nThe cell-surface membrane of animal cells also surrounds the cell. There \nare no cell walls in animal cells and so the membrane is on the outside \nof these cells. The membrane controls what substances go in and out of \nthe cell. Many cells need glucose and oxygen for respiration, and these \nsubstances move by diffusion into the cell from the blood, where it is \nfound at a higher concentration. Carbon dioxide moves back into the \nblood capillaries through the membrane.\nMitochondria are small organelles found in the cytoplasm and are \nonly present in eukaryotic cells. They are the site of most of a cell\u2019s \nrespiration. Here the energy stored in glucose is released for the cell \nto complete the seven life processes. Without this energy all cells die. \nMore-active cells such as those in muscles or sperm cells usually have \nmore mitochondria because these cells need more energy. Mitochondria \nhave many folds inside them, which make their surface area very large \nto increase the rate at which energy is released.\nRibosomes are the site of protein synthesis. These organelles are \npresent in the cytoplasm of animal cells.\nKEy TERM\nDiffusion  The net movement \nof particles from an area of high \nconcentration to an area of lower concentration.\nnucleuscell surface\nmembrane\ncytoplasmmitochondria\nribosomes\nAnimal and plant cells\n11Animal cells are unlike bacterial cells in that they usually possess a \nnucleus. This component is present in almost all eukaryotic cells. It is \nfound in the cytoplasm and is surrounded by its own membrane. The \ncell\u2019s genetic material (DNA) is enclosed within it, arranged into shapes \ncalled chromosomes. (Red blood cells do not have a nucleus, so they \nhave more room to absorb and carry the maximum amount of oxygen, \nwhich is their main function.)\nHumans are of course classified as animals. Many of our cells are like \nother animal cells.\n\u25cf\u25cfGeneralised plant cells\nLike those belonging to animals, plant cells are eukaryotic. This means that \nthey may belong to single-celled or multicellular organisms, they do have a \nnucleus and they are generally larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells.\n\u25b2 Figure 1.7 A generalised plant cell as seen with a microscope (magnified \u00d72800) \nand as three- and two-dimensional diagrams.\nComponents of plant cells\nPlant cells have many components in common with animal cells, \nincluding a nucleus in which the organism\u2019s genetic material (DNA) \nis found. Plant cells also possess ribosomes for protein synthesis and \nmitochondria for respiration in their cytoplasm.\nPlant cells possess some components not present in animal cells. \nChloroplasts are small components, full of a green pigment called \nchlorophyll which is necessary for photosynthesis to occur. This reaction \nuses light energy from the Sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into \nglucose and oxygen and so provides an energy source for the plant. It is \nthe green chlorophyll in plants that gives some of their parts their green \ncolour. Most roots are hidden from the Sun and so cannot photosynthesise. \nThey do not have chloroplasts and so are often white, not green.\nThere are huge numbers of chloroplasts in leaf cells. There are often \nwell over half a million per square millimetre of leaf.\nPlant cells also possess a cell wall, unlike animal cells. This is made \nfrom cellulose and provides structure for the cell. Plants would not be \nable to stand upright to catch light energy from the Sun without cell \nwalls. The cell surface membrane is found inside the cell wall.\nKEy TERM\nPhotosynthesis  An endothermic \nreaction that occurs in the \nchloroplasts of plants and algae and \nstores energy in glucose.\nmitochondria\nnucleuscell surface \nmembranecell wallchlor oplastsvacuolecytoplasm\nribosomes\n\u25b2 Figure 1.8 The structure of a \nchloroplast (magnification about \u00d715 000).","12":"24Topic 2A \u2014 Cell Structure and DivisionEukaryotic Cells and OrganellesThere are two types of cell \u2014 prokaryotic and eukaryotic.

All sugars can be classified as reducing or non-reducing. The Benedict's test tests for sugars \u2014 it differs depending on the type of sugar you are testing for.1)2)3)Reducing sugars include all monosaccharides (e.g. glucose) and some disaccharides (e.g. maltose and lactose).You add Benedict's reagent (which is blue) to a sample and heat it in a water bath that's been brought to the boil.If the test's positive it will form a coloured precipitate (solid particles suspended in the solution).The colour of the precipitate changes from:blue-\u00a3> green>=>-yellowH>orange=4> brick redr Alwars us\u00ab an excess of r Z Benedict's solution \u2014 ;Z thls mak\u00ab sure that all ~ Z the sugar reacts. z1 1 1 \" I I I I I I M M | | | V\\N4)The higher the concentration of reducing sugar, the further the colour change goes \u2014 you can use this to compare the amount of reducing sugar in different solutions. A more accurate way of doing this is to filter the solution and weigh the precipitate.C\/1d\u00a3<UD1X1UZuDOLUIzO1) If the result of the reducing sugars test is negative, there could still be a non-reducing sugar present. To test for non-reducing sugars, like sucrose, first you have to break them down into monosaccharides.2) You do this by getting a new sample of the test solution, adding dilute hydrochloric acid and carefully heating it in a water bath that's been brought to the boil. You then neutralise it with sodium hydrogencarbonate. Then just carry out the Benedict's test as you would for a reducing sugar.3) If the test's positive it will form a coloured precipitate (as for the reducing sugars test). If the test's negative the solution will stay blue, which means it doesn't contain any sugar (either reducing or non-reducing).Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n4CarbohydratesSo, you've already looked at monosaccharides and disaccharides... now it's time to give polysaccharides some love.Polysaccharides are Loads of Sugars Joined TogetherA polysaccharide is formed when more than two monosaccharides are joined together by condensation reactions.\na-glucose a-glucose a-glucose a-glucose a-glucoseYou need to know about the relationship between the structure and function of three polysaccharides\u2014 starch, glycogen and cellulose.Starch is the Main Energy Storage Material in Plants\none alpha-glucose molecule1) Cells get energy from glucose. Plants store excess glucose as starch (when a plant needs more glucose for energy, it breaks down starch to release the glucose).2) Starch is a mixture of two polysaccharides of alpha-glucose \u2014 amylose and amylopectin:\u2022 Amylose \u2014 a long, unbranched chain of a-glucose. The angles of the glycosidic bonds give it a coiled structure, almost like a cylinder. This makes it compact, so it's really good for storage because you can fit more in to a small space.\u2022 Amylopectin \u2014 a long, branched chain of a-glucose. Its side branches allow the enzymes that break down the molecule to get at the glycosidic bonds easily.This means that the glucose can be released quickly. Amylopectin3) Starch is insoluble in water and doesn't affect water potential (see page 40), so it doesn't cause water to enter cells by osmosis, which would make them swell.This makes it good for storage.Use the Iodine Test for StarchIf you do any experiment on the digestion of starch and want to find out if any is left, you'll need the iodine test.just add iodine dissolved in potassium iodide solution to the test sample. If there is starch present, the sample changes from browny-orange to a dark, blue-black colour.Glycogen is the Main Energy Storage Material in AnimalsGlycogen1) Animal cells get energy from glucose too.But animals store excess glucose as glycogen\u2014 another polysaccharide of alpha-glucose.2) Its structure is very similar to amylopectin, except that it has loads more side branches coming off it. Loads of branches means that stored glucose can be released quickly, which is important for energy release in animals.3) It's also a very compact molecule, so it's good for storage.After throwing and fetching the ball no less than 312 times, Chappy and Stuart were finally out of glycogen.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","14":"24Topic 2A \u2014 Cell Structure and DivisionEukaryotic Cells and OrganellesThere are two types of cell \u2014 prokaryotic and eukaryotic.

You'll need to think about what organelles the cell needs to do its job \u2014 e.g. if the cell uses a lot of energy, it'll need lots of mitochondria. If it makes a lot of proteins it'll need a lot of ribosomes.Example:1)2)3)Epithelial cells in the small intestine are specialised to absorb food efficiently.The walls of the small intestine have lots of finger-like projections microvilli increasei \u2022 \/\u2022 ft surface areacalled villi. These increase surface area for absorption.The epithelial cells on the surface of the villi have folds in their cell-surface nucleusmembranes, called microvilli.

Different organs make up an organ system.For example...Epithelial cells make up epithelial tissue. Epithelial tissue, muscular tissue and glandular tissue(which secretes chemicals) all work together to form the stomach \u2014 an organ. The stomach is part of the digestive system \u2014 this is an organ system made up of all the organs involved in the digestion and absorption of food (including the small intestine, large intestine and liver).Practice QuestionsQ1 What is a plant cell wall made of?

I'm afraid they'll keep popping up throughout the rest of the hook \u2014 mitochondria are needed for respiration, the cell-surface membrane is essential for controlling the movement of things in and out of the cell, and all the DNA stuff happens in the nucleus.Topic 2 A \u2014 Cell Structure and Division\n","15":"30Analysis of Cell ComponentsYou can use microscopes to look at all the lovely organelles you've been learning about...Magnification is Size, Resolution is DetailWe all know that microscopes produce a magnified image of a sample, but resolution is just as important...\nThere are Two Main Types of Microscope \u2014 Optical and ElectronOptical (light) microscopes ------------------------------1) They use light to form an image.2) They have a maximum resolution of about0.2 micrometres (pm). This means you can't use an optical microscope to view organelles smaller than 0.2 pm. That includes ribosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes. You may be able to make out mitochondria \u2014 but not in perfect detail. You can also see the nucleus.3) The maximum useful magnification of an optical microscope is about x 1500.1) TEMs use electromagnets to focus a beam of electrons, which is then transmitted through the specimen.2) Denser parts of the spccimcn absorb more electrons, which makes them look darker on the image you end up with.3) TEMs are good because they give high resolution images, so you see the internal structure of organelles like chloroplasts.4) But they can only be used on thin specimens.Electron microscopes ---------------------------------1) They use electrons to form an image.2) They have a higher resolution than optical microscopes so give a more detailed image (and can be used to look at more organelles).3) They have a maximum resolution of about 0.0002 micrometres (|jm). (About 1000 times higher than optical microscopes.)4) The maximum useful magnification of an electron microscope is about x 1 500 000.'1 \"1111' 11 u ii 111 m in ii\/ A micrometre (jjm) is three - orders of magnitude smaller z than a millimetre (1 ym = -0.001 mm).

This knocks off electrons from the specimen, which are gathered in a cathode ray tube to form an image.2) The images you end up with show the surface of the specimen and they can be 3-D.3) SEMs are good because they can be used on thick specimens.4) But they give lower resolution images than TEMs.Electron Microscopes are either Scanning\u2019or \u2018Transmission\u2019Transmission electron microscopes (TEMs)Scanning electron microscopes (SEMs)1)\nYou View Specimens Under an Optical Microscope Using SlidesHere's how to prepare a 'temporary mount' of a specimen on a slide:\u2022 Start by pipetting a small drop of water onto the slide (a strip of clear glass or plastic).Then use tweezers to place a thin section of your specimen on top of the water drop.\u2022 Add a drop of a stain. Stains are used to highlight objects in a cell. For example, eosin is used to make the cytoplasm show up. Iodine in potassium iodide solution (see p. 4) is used to stain starch grains in plant cells.\u2022 Finally, add the cover slip (a square of clear plastic that protects the specimen). To do so, stand the slip upright on the slide, next to the water droplet. Then carefully tilt and lower it so it covers the specimen.Try not to get any air bubbles under there \u2014 they'll obstruct your view of the specimen (see page 35).Topic 2A \u2014 Cell Structure and Division\n","16":"31Analysis of Cell ComponentsCell Fractionation Separates OrganellesSuppose you wanted to look at some organelles under an electron microscope. First you'd need to separate them from the rest of the cell \u2014 you can do this by cell fractionation. There are three steps to this technique:(7) Homogenisation \u2014 Breaking Up the Cells jHomogenisation can be done in several different ways, e.g. by vibrating the cells or by grinding the cells up in a blender. This breaks up the plasma membrane and releases the organelles into solution. The solution must be kept ice-cold, to reduce the activity of enzymes that break down organelles. The solution should also be isotonic \u2014 this means it should have the same concentration of chemicals as the cells being broken down, to prevent damage to the organelles through osmosis. A buffer solution should be added to maintain the pH.(7) Filtration \u2014 Getting Rid of the Big Bits )Next, the homogenised cell solution is filtered through a gauze to separate any large cell debris or tissue debris, like connective tissue, from the organelles.The organelles are much smaller than the debris, so they pass through the gauze.(3) Ultracentrifugation \u2014 Separating the Organelles JAfter filtration, you're left with a solution containing a mixture of organelles. To separate a particular organelle from all the others you use ultracentrifugation.1) The cell fragments are poured into a tube. The tube is put into a centrifuge (a machine that separates material by spinning) and is spun at a low speed. The heaviest organelles, like nuclei, get flung to the bottom of the tube by the centrifuge. They form a thick sediment at the bottom\u2014 the pellet. The rest of the organelles stay suspended in the fluid above the sediment \u2014 the supernatant.2) The supernatant is drained off, poured into another tube, and spun in the centrifuge at a higher speed.Again, the heaviest organelles, this time the mitochondria, form a pellet at the bottom of the tube. The supernatant containing the rest of the organelles is drained off and spun in the centrifuge at an even higher speed.3) This process is repeated at higher and higher speeds, until all the organelles are separated out. Each time, the pellet at the bottom of the tube is made up of lighter and lighter organelles.As the ride got faster, everyone felt their nuclei sink to their toes..- Plant cells,~ the chloroplasts :Z corne out after the = ~ nuclei, but before ~z. the mitochondria. - . . \" \" '1111111 \\ 1 n'endoplasmicreticulumribosomeslysosomesmitochondrianuclei\u2019The organelles are separatedorder of mass(from heaviest to lightest) \u2014 this order is usually: nuclei, then mitochondria, then lysosomes, then endoplasmic reticulum, and finally ribosomes.Practice QuestionsQ1 What is meant by a microscope's magnification?Q2 What is meant by a microscope's resolution?Exam QuestionsQ1 The table shows the dimensions of some different organelles found in animal cells.Name those organelles in the table that would be visible using a good quality light microscope.Explain your answer.

Here's an example:4.5. eyepiece divisions = 1 stage divisionEyepiece graticule 10 20 30 40 5020301 division = 0.1 mm Stage micrometer.Or You Can Use This Formula..D2)3)4)5)Line up the eyepiece graticule and the stage micrometer.Each division on the stage micrometer is 0.1 mm long.At this magnification, 1 division on the stage micrometer is the same as 4.5 divisions on the eyepiece graticule.To work out the size of 1 division on the eyepiece graticule,you need to divide 0.1 by 4.5:1 division on eyepiece graticule = 0.1 4.5 = 0.022 mmSo if you look at a cell under the microscope at this magnificationand it\u2019s 4 eyepiece divisions long, you know it measures:4 x 0.022 = 0.088 mm. 1 11111111' i11i 111111 n 111\/ j 11111 u Z The eyepiece graticule will need to be Z - re-calibrated at different magnifications. -11111111111 n 111 m 11111111111 n i ii FIf you're given an image of cells under the microscope in the exam, you can calculate their actual size using this formula:Example: If the image of a cell measures 5 mm and the magnification is x 100, then the actual size of the cell will be: 5 \u2022*-100 = 0.05 mm.actual size =size of image magnificationArtefacts Can Get in the Way of Your Observations1) Artefacts are things that you can see down the microscope that aren't part of the cell or specimen that you're looking at.2) They can be anything from bits of dust, air bubbles and fingerprints, The new organelle Steveto inaccuracies caused by scjjashf^and staining your sample. had discovered looked just3) Artefacts are usually made during the preparation of your slides and shouldn't really be I'ke his thumb print, there at ail \u2014 you'll need to prepare your root tip cells carefully to avoid creating artefacts.Artefacts are especially common in electron micrographs because specimens need a lot of preparation before you can view them under an electron microscope. The first scientists to use these microscopes could only distinguish between artefacts and organelles by repeatedly preparing specimens in different ways. If an object could be seen with one preparation technique, but not another, it was more likely to be an artefact than an organelle.Practice QuestionsQ1 Why do you need to squash the tissue when preparing a slide of plant root tip cells?Exam QuestionQ1 A sample of cells was prepared to observe mitosis.

Well now it's time to delve a little deeper...Membranes Control What Passes Through ThemAll cells are surrounded by membranes. In eukaryotic cells,many of the organelles are surrounded by membranes too.1)2)Cell-surface membranes surround cells. They are a barrier between the cell and its environment, controlling which substances enter and leave the cell. They're partially permeable \u2014 they let some molecules through but not others. Substances can move across the cell-surface membrane by diffusion, osmosis or active transport (see pages 38-43).The membranes around organelles divide the cell into different compartments \u2014 they act as a barrier between the organelle and the cytoplasm. They are also partially permeable and control what substances enter and leave the organelle.Cell Membranes have a Fluid Mosaic\u2019 StructurePartially permeable membranes can be useful at sea.The basic structure of all cell membranes is pretty much the same. They're composed of lipids (mainly phospholipids \u2014 see page 7), proteins and carbohydrates (attached to proteins or lipids).1)2)3)4)5)In 1972, the fluid mosaic model was suggested to describe the arrangement of molecules in the membrane.

They bind to the cholesterolhydrophobic tails of the phospholipids, causing them to pack more closely together.This restricts the movement of the phospholipids, making the membrane less fluid and more rigid.Cholesterol helps to maintain the shape of animal cells (which don't have cell walls). This is particularly important for cells that aren't supported by other cells, e.g. red blood cells, which float free in the blood.Topic 2B \u2014 Cell Membranes\n37Cell Membrane StructureThe Permeability of the Cell Membrane can be Investigated in the LabThe permeability of cell membranes is affected by different conditions, e.g. temperature and solvent concentration. You can investigate how these things affect permeability by doing an experiment using beetroot. Beetroot cells contain a coloured pigment that leaks out \u2014 the higher the permeability of the membrane, the more pigment leaks out of the cell. Here's how you could investigate how temperature affects beetroot membrane permeability:1) Use a scalpel to carefully cut five equal sized pieces of beetroot. (Make sure you do your cutting on a cutting board.) Rinse the pieces to remove any pigment released during cutting.2) Add the five pieces to five different test tubes, each containing 5 cm3 of water.Use a measuring cylinder or pipette to measure the water.3) Place each test tube in a water bath at a different temperature, e.g. 10 \u00b0C, 20 \u00b0C, 30 40 \u00b0C, 50 \u00b0C, for the same length of time (measured using a stopwatch).4) Remove the pieces of beetroot from the tubes, leaving just the coloured liquid.5) Now you need to use a colorimeter \u2014 a machine that passes light through the liquid and measures how much of that light is absorbed. The higher the absorbance, the more pigment released, so the higher the permeability of the membrane.6) You can connect the colorimeter to a computer and use software to collect the data and draw a graph of the results.\u00b0C,'ii 11 i 11 n ii 1111111,11111 ^- Colorimeters needr 5 minutes to stabilise before E- using and calibrating at zero -- by taking a measurement ~ ~ through pure water. \u2014\\ 11 i i ii n i ii j h 11 j n 111Increasing the Temperature Increases Membrane PermeabilityExperiments like the one above have shown that membrane permeability changes with temperature:(J) Temperatures below 0 \u00b0C \u2014 the phospholipids don't have much energy, so they can t move very much.

This continues until particles are evenly distributed throughout the liquid or gas.3) The concentration gradient is the path from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.

They're also non-polar, which makes them soluble in lipids, so they can dissolve in the hydrophobic bilayer.6) When molecules diffuse directly through a cell membrane, it's also known as simple diffusion.Facilitated Diffusion uses Carrier Proteins and Protein Channels1) Some larger molecules (e.g. amino acids, glucose) would diffuse extremely slowly through the phospholipid bilayer because they're so big.2) Charged particles, e.g. ions and polar molecules, would also diffuse slowly \u2014 that'sbecause they're water soluble, and the centre of the bilayer is hydrophobic (see page 36).3) So to speed things up, large or charged particles diffuse through carrier proteins or channel proteins in the membrane instead \u2014 this is called facilitated diffusion.4) Like diffusion, facilitated diffusion moves particles down a concentration gradient, from a higher to a lower concentration.5) It's also a passive process \u2014 it doesn't use energy.'fiAndy needed all his concentration for this particular gradient...Carrier proteins move large molecules across membranes, down their concentration gradient.

As osmosis takes place, the difference in water potential on either side of the membrane decreases, so the rate of osmosis levels off over time.2) The thickness of the exchange surface \u2014 the thinner the exchange surface, the faster the rate of osmosis.3) The surface area of the exchange surface \u2014 the larger the surface area, the faster the rate of osmosis.You can do Experiments to Investigate Water Potential using Serial DilutionsYou can do a simple experiment, using potato cylinders, to find out the water potential of plant tissue (see next page). First though, you need to make up several solutions of different, known concentrations to test the cylinders in.

You now have 10 cm3 of solution that's half as concentrated as the solution in the first test tube (it's 1 M).4)Repeat this process three more times to create solutions of 0.5 M, 0.25 M and 0.125 M.10 cm of 2 M sucrose solution5 cm\" of distilled waterTopic 2B \u2014 Cell Membranes\n41Exchange Across Cell Membranes \u2014 OsmosisYou Can Also Make Solutions of Different Concentrations By Finding the Scale FactorYou can make sucrose solutions of any concentration by finding the scale factor.For example, if you want to make 15 cm3 of 0.4 M sucrose solution...1) Start with a solution of a known concentration, e.g. 1 M.2) Find the scale factor by dividing the concentration of this solution by the concentration ofthe solution you want to make. So in this case the scale factor = 1 M -=- 0.4 M = 2.5.3) This means that the solution you want to make is 2.5 times weaker than the one you have.To make the solution 2.5 times weaker, use 2.5 times less of it, i.e. 15 cm3 4 2.5 = 6 cm3.Transfer this amount to a clean test tube.4) Top up the test tube with distilled water to get the volume you want to make.In this case you want to make 15 cm3 of solution, so you need to add: 15-6 = 9 cm3 of distilled water.Use Your Solutions To Find the Water Potential of Potato Cells20 -101) Use a cork borer to cut potatoes into identically sized chips, about 1 cm in diameter.2) Divide the chips into groups of three and measure the mass of each group using a mass balance.3) Place one group into each of your sucrose solutions.4) Leave the chips in the solutions for at least 20 minutes(making sure that they all get the same amount of time).5) Remove the chips and pat dry gently with a paper towel6) Weigh each group again and record your results.7) Calculate the % change in mass for each group.8) Use the results to make a calibration curve, showing % change in mass against sucrose concentrationThe potato chips will gain water (and therefore mass) in solutions with a higher water potentialthan the chips, and lose water in solutions with a lower water potential.The point at which the curve crosses the x-axis (where the % change in mass is 0) is the point at which the waterpotential of the sucrose solution is the same as the water potential of the potato cells.

Humans need things like money and the newest mobile phone, but enzymes are quite content with the right temperature and pH.Temperature has a Big Influence on Enzyme ActivityLike any chemical reaction, the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction increases when the temperature's increased. More heat means more kinetic energy, so molecules move faster. This makes the enzymes more likely to collide with the substrate molecules. The energy of these collisions also increases, which means each collision is more likely to result in a reaction. But, if the temperature gets too high, the reaction stops.1) The rise in temperature makes the enzyme's molecules vibrate more.2) If the temperature goes above a certain level, this vibration breaks some of the bonds that hold the enzyme in shape.3) The active site changes shape and the enzyme and substrate no longer fit together.4) At this point, the enzyme is denatured\u2014 it no longer functions as a catalyst.optimum temperature11 nn 11,TemperaturepH Also Affects Enzyme ActivityO\u2019\" \" I M I | | | ,, , ,~ Every enzyme has an enzyme is r optimum temperature = denatured r For most human enzymes - r ,t,saro^37\u00b0C but some r _ enzymes, like those used in ~- biological washing powders, ~ ~ can work well at 60 \u00b0C ~All enzymes have an optimum pH value. Most human enzymes work best at pH 7 (neutral), but there are exceptions. Pepsin, for example, works best at acidic pH 2, which is useful because it's found in the stomach. Above and below the optimum pH, the H+ and OH ions found in acids and alkalis can mess up the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds that hold the enzyme's tertiary structure in place. This makes the active site change shape, so the enzyme is denatured.Enzyme Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction1) The more enzyme molecules there are in a solution,the more likely a substrate molecule is to collide with one and form an enzyme-substrate complex. So increasing the concentration of the enzyme increases the rate of reaction.2) But, if the amount of substrate is limited, there comes a point when there's more than enough enzyme molecules to deal with all the available substrate, so adding more enzyme has no further effect.steady increase as more active sites are available \\if substrate amount is limited, an increase in enzyme concentration eventually has no further effectEnzyme ConcentrationSubstrate Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction Up to a Pointsteady increase as more substrate molecules are availableall active sites used \u2014 increase in substrate concentration has no further effectSubstrate Concentration1) The higher the substrate concentration, the faster the reaction \u2014 more substrate molecules means a collision between substrate and enzyme is more likely and so more active sites will be used. This is only true up until a 'saturation' point though. After that, there are so many substrate molecules that the enzymes have about as much as they can cope with(all the active sites are full), and adding more makes no difference.2) Substrate concentration decreases with time during a reaction (unless more substrate is added to the reaction mixture), so if no other variables are changed, the rate of reaction will decrease over time too. This makes the initial rate of reaction (the reaction rate at the start) the highest rate of reaction.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n13Factors Affecting Enzyme ActivityEnzyme Activity can be InhibitedEnzyme activity can be prevented by enzyme inhibitors Inhibition can be competitive or non-competitive.COMPETITIVE INHIBITIONmolecules that bind to the enzyme that they inhibit.1) Competitive inhibitor molecules have a similar shape to that of the substrate molecules.2) They compete with the substrate molecules to bind to the active site, but no reaction takes place.3) Instead they block the active site, so no substrate molecules can fit in it. ienzymesubstrateinhibitor molecule fits into active site because it is a similar shape to the substrate moleculeenzyme-controlled reaction without an inhibitorsame reaction with a competitive inhibitor \u2014 rate increases as substrate concentration is increasedSubstrate Concentration4) How much the enzyme is inhibited depends on the relative concentrations of the inhibitor and the substrate.5) If there's a high concentration of the inhibitor, it'll take up nearly all the active sites and hardly any of the substrate wil get to the enzyme.6) But if there's a higher concentration of substrate, then the substrate's chances of getting to an active site before the inhibitor increase. So increasing the concentration of substrate will increase the rate of reaction (up to a point).NON-COMPETITIVE INHIBITION1) Non-competitive inhibitor molecules bind to the enzyme away from its active site.2) This causes the active site to change shape so the substrate molecules can no longer bind to it.3) They don't 'compete' with the substrate molecules to bind to the active site because they are a different shape.4) Increasing the concentration of substrate won't make any difference to the reaction rate \u2014 enzyme activity will still be inhibited.inhibitor molecule fits onto enzyme away from active siteenzymesubstrate molecule can no longer fit into active siteVXinhibitor causes changes that alter active sitensCZ.nsO'enzyme-controlled reaction without an inhibitorsame reaction with a non-competitive inhibitor \u2014 increasing the substrate conc. has little effect on rateiSubstrate ConcentrationPractice QuestionsQ1 Draw a graph to show the effect of temperature on enzyme activity.Q2 Draw a graph to show the effect of pH on enzyme activity.Q3 Explain the effect of increasing substrate concentration on the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction.Exam QuestionQ1 Inhibitors prevent enzymes from working properly.

Some drugs are enzyme inhibitors though, e.g. penicillin, so they're not all bad.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","22":"44Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune SystemThe Immune SystemAn infectious disease is one that is caused by pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses and fungi. Infectious diseases can be really nasty, but luckily there's an army of cells in the body that helps lo protect us \u2014 the immune system.Foreign Antigens Trigger an Immune ResponseAntigens are molecules (usually proteins) that can generate an immune response when clctected by the body.They arc usually found on the surface of cells and are used by the immune system to identify: pathogens (organisms that cause disease), abnormal body cells (e.g. cancerous or pathogen-infected cells, which have abnormal antigens on their surface), toxins and cells from other individuals of the same species (e.g. organ transplants).There are four main stages in the immune response:(T) Phagocytes Engulf PathogensA phagocyte (e.g. a macrophage) is a type of white blood cell that carries out phagocytosis (engulfment of pathogens). They're found in the blood and in tissues and are the first cells to respond to an immune system trigger inside the body. Here's how they work:1) A phagocyte recognises the foreign antigens on a pathogen.2) The cytoplasm of the phagocyte moves round the pathogen, engulfing it.3) The pathogen is now contained in a phagocytic vacuole (a bubble) in the cytoplasm of the phagocyte.4) A lysosome (an organelle that contain enzymes called lysozymes) fuses with the phagocytic vacuole. The lysozymes break down the pathogen.5) The phagocyte then presents the pathogen's antigens \u2014 it sticks the antigens on its surface to activate other immune system cells.nucleuscytoplasmlysosomeantigens on surface ofphagocyte engulfs the pathogenlysosome fuses with phagocytic vacuole(2) Phagocytes Activate T-cellsA T-cell {also called a T-lymphocyte) is another type of white blood cell. It has receptor proteins on its surface that bind to complementary antigens presented to it by phagocytes. This activates the T-cell. Different types of T-cells respond in different ways. For example, helper T-cells {TH cells) release chemical signals that activate and stimulate phagocytes and cytotoxic T-cells (Tc cells), which kill abnormal and foreign cells B-cells, which secrete antibodies (see below).Th cells also activate(3) T-cells Activate B-cells, Which Divide into Plasma CellsB-cells (also called B-lymphocytes) are also a type of white blood cell. They're covered with antibodies \u2014 proteins that bind antigens to form an antigen-antibody complex. Each B-cell has a different shaped antibody on its membrane, so different ones bind to different shaped antigens.1) When the antibody on the surface of a B-cell meets a complementary shaped antigen, it binds to it.2) This, together with substances released from helper T-cells, activates the B-cell. This process is called clonal selection.3) The activated B-cell divides into plasma cells.(V) Plasma Cells Make More Antibodies to a Specific AntigenPlasma cells are identical to the B-cell (they're clones). They secrete loads of antibodies specific to the antigen. These are called monoclonal antibodies. They bind to the antigens on the surface of the pathogen to form lots of antigen-antibody complexes,An antibody has two binding sites, so can bind to two pathogens at the same time. This means that pathogens become clumped together \u2014 this is called agglutination. Phagocytes then bind to the antibodies and phagocytose many pathogens at once. This process leads to the destruction of pathogens carrying this antigen in the body.variableregions(orange)constan regions (blue)heavychainAntibodies are proteins \u2014 they're made up of chains of amino acids.The specificity of an antibody depends on its variable regions, which form the antigen binding sites. Each antibody has a variable region with a unique tertiary structure {due to different amino acid sequences) that's complementary to one specific antigen. All antibodies have the same constant regions.Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n45The Immune SystemThe Immune Response Can be Split into Cellular and HumoralJust to add to your fun, the immune response is split into two \u2014 the cellular response and the humoral response.1) Cellular \u2014 The T-cells and other immune system cells that they interact with, e.g. phagocytes, form the cellular response.2) Humoral \u2014 B-cells, clonal selection and the production of monoclonal antibodies form the humoral response.Both types of response are needed to remove a pathogen from the body and the responses interact with each other, e.g. T-cells help to activate B-cells, and antibodies coat pathogens making it easier for phagocytes to engulf them.The Immune Response for Antigens can be MemorisedThe Primary Immune ResponseNeil's primary response \u2014 to his parents.1) When an antigen enters the body for the first time it activates the immune system. This is called the primary response.2) The primary response is slow because there aren't many B-cells that can make the antibody needed to bind to it.3) Eventually the body will produce enough of the right antibody to overcome the infection. Meanwhile the infected person will show symptoms of the disease.4) After being exposed to an antigen, both T- and B-cells produce memory cells. These memory cells remain in the body for a long time. Memory T-cells remember the specific antigen and will recognise it a second time round. Memory B-cells record the specific antibodies needed to bind the antigen.5) The person is now immune \u2014 their immune system has the ability to respond quickly to a second infection.The Secondary Immune Response1)2)3)If the same pathogen enters the body again,the immune system will produce a quicker, strongerimmune response \u2014 the secondary response.Clonal selection happens faster. Memory B-cells areactivated and divide into plasma cells that produce the right antibody to the antigen. Memory T-cells are activated and divide into the correct type of T-cells to kill the cell carrying the antigen.The secondary response often gets rid of the pathogen before you begin to show any symptoms (you are immune to the pathogen).Practice QuestionsQ1 What are antigens?Q2 What does the humoral response involve?

This means you become immune without getting any symptoms.3) Vaccines protect individuals that have them and, because they reduce the occurrence of the disease, those not vaccinated are also less likely to catch the disease (because there are fewer people to catch it from). This is called herd immunity.4) Vaccines always contain antigens \u2014 these may be free or attached to a dead or attenuated (weakened) pathogen.5) Vaccines may be injected or taken orally. The disadvantages of taking a vaccine orally are that it could be broken down by enzymes in the gut or the molecules of the vaccine may be too large to be absorbed into the blood.6) Sometimes booster vaccines are given later on (e.g. after several years) to make sure that memory cells are produced.Antigenic Variation Helps Some Pathogens Evade the Immune System1) Antigens on the surface of pathogens activate the primary response.2) When you're infected a second time with the same pathogen (which has the same antigens on its surface) they activate the secondary response and you don't get ill.3) However, some sneaky pathogens can change their surface antigens. This antigen variability is called antigenic variation. (Different antigens are formed due to changes in the genes of a pathogen.)4) This means that when you're infected for a second time, the memory cells produced from the first infection will not recognise the different antigens. So the immune system has to start from scratch and carry out a primary response against these new antigens.5) This primary response takes time to get rid of the infection, which is why you get ill again.6) Antigenic variation also makes it difficult to develop vaccines against some pathogens for the same reason. Examples of pathogens that show antigenic variation include HIV and the influenza virus.7) Here's how antigenic variation affects the production of vaccines to help prevent people catching influenza:1) The influenza (flu) vaccine changes every year. That's because the antigens on the surface of the influenza virus change regularly, forming new strains of the virus.2) Memory cells produced from vaccination with one strain of the flu will not recognise other strains with different antigens. The strains are immunologically distinct.3) Every year there are different strains of the influenza virus circulating in the population, so a different vaccine has to be made.4) New vaccines are developed and one is chosen every year that is the most effective against the recently circulating influenza viruses.5) Governments and health authorities then implement a programme of vaccination using the most suitable vaccine.1st infection\n2nd infectiondifferent antigensThe oral vaccine was proving hard to swallow.\nTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n47Immunity and VaccinesImmunity can be Active or PassiveACTIVE IMMUNITYThis is the type of immunity you get when your immune system makes its own antibodies after being stimulated by an antigen. There are two different types of active immunity:1) Natural \u2014 this is when you become immune after catching a disease.2) Artificial \u2014 this is when you become immune after you've been given a vaccination containing a harmless dose of antigen.PASSIVE IMMUNITYThis is the type of immunity you get from being given antibodies made by a different organism\u2014 your immune system doesn't produce any antibodies of its own. Again, there are two types:1) Natural \u2014 this is when a baby becomes immune due to the antibodies it receives from its mother, through the placenta and in breast milk.2) Artificial \u2014 this is when you become immune after being injected with antibodies from someone else. E.g. If you contract tetanus you can be injected with antibodies against the tetanus toxin, collected from blood donations.Active and Passive Immunity Have Contrasting CharacteristicsIn the exam you might be asked about the differences between these types of immunity:Active immunityPassive immunityRequires exposure to antigenDoesn't require exposure to antigenIt takes a while for protection to developProtection is immediateMemory cells are producedMemory cells aren't producedProtection is long-term because the antibody is produced (after activation of memory cells) in response to complementary antigen being present in the bodyProtection is short-term because the antibodies given are broken downPractice QuestionsQ1 How do vaccines cause immunity?Q2 Explain what antigenic variability is.Exam QuestionsQ1 Vaccines can be used to protect people against some diseases. Not all individuals in a population must receive the vaccine for a vaccination programme to be successful. Explain why this is the case.Q2 The influenza virus causes the flu. Explain why it is possible to suffer from the flu more than once.Q3 Immunity from a disease can be either active or passive.a) Explain why active immunity offers long-term protection against a disease, whereas passive immunity only offers protection in the short-term.b) It normally takes 14 days for immunity to develop after receiving a vaccine.Explain why vaccines do not usually offer immediate protection against a disease.An injection of dead bugs \u2014 roll on mv next vaccine...The influenza virus is so clever that it would almost make you think it had a mind of its own. I mean, as soon as we catch up with it and develop a vaccine, off it goes and changes its surface antigens again. Influenza virus: one, humans: nil. This is one of the ways viruses have evolved to avoid your immune system.

Let's all give three cheers for antibodies. Without them, we'd all probably be dead by now.Monoclonal Antibodies can be used to Target Specific Substances or Cells1) Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies produced from a single group of genetically identical B-cells(plasma cells). This means that they're all identical in structure.2) As you know, antibodies are very specific because their binding sites have a unique tertiary structure (see p.44) that only one particular antigen will fit into (one with a complementary shape).3) You can make monoclonal antibodies that bind to anything you want, e.g. a cell antigen or other substance, and they will only bind to (target) this molecule.EXAMPLE: Targeting drugs to a particular cell type \u2014 cancer cells1) Different cells in the body have different surface antigens.2) Cancer cells have antigens called tumour markers that are not found on normal body cells.3) Monoclonal antibodies can be made that will bind to the tumour markers.4) You can also attach anti-cancer drugs to the antibodies.5) When the antibodies come into contact with the canccr cells they will bind to the tumour markers.6) This means the drug will only accumulate in the body where there are cancer cells.7) So, the side effects of an antibody-based drug are lower than other drugs because they accumulate near specific cells.monoclonalantibodyantigen binding siteanti-cancer drugdrug attached to antibodyantibody binds to tumour markers on cancer cellcell-surface antigen\/\\----------------------------No0No------------------------------------------------------------\u2014L\nnormal body cell tumour marker cancer cellEXAMPLE: Targeting a particular substance for medical diagnosis \u2014 pregnancy testingPregnancy tests detect the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) that's found in the urine of pregnant women:1) The application area contains antibodies for hCG bound to a coloured bead (blue).2) When urine is applied to the application area any hCG will bind to the antibody on the beads, forming an antigen-antibody complex.3) The urine moves up the stick to the test strip, carrying any beads with it.4) The test strip contains antibodies to hCG that are stuck in place (immobilised).5) If there is hCG present the test strip turns blue because the immobilised antibody binds to any hCG \u2014 concentrating the hCG-antibody complex with the blue beads attached.If no hCG is present, the beads will pass through the test area without binding to anything, and so it won't go blue.coloured bead antibody \u00a9 ^ to hCGhCG\nappflow of liquidIimmobilised antibody to hCGication areatest stripTopic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\n49Antibodies in MedicineThe ELISA Test is a Medical Diagnostic Test that Uses Antibodies1) The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) allows you to see if a patient has any antibodies to a certain antigen (see example below) or any antigen to a certain antibody.2) It can be used to test for pathogenic infections, for allergies (e.g. to nuts or lactose) and for just about anything you can make an antibody for.3) In an ELISA test, an antibody is used which has an enzyme attached to it. This enzyme can react with asubstrate to produce a coloured product. This causes the solution in the reaction vessel to change colour.4) If there's a colour change, it demonstrates that the antigen or antibody of interest is present in the sample being tested (e.g. blood plasma). In some types of ELISA, the quantity of this antigen\/antibody can be worked out from the intensity of the colour change.5) There are several different types of ELISA. Direct ELISA uses a single antibody that is complementary to the antigen you're testing for. Indirect ELISA is different because it uses two different antibodies.This method is outlined below:EXAMPLE: Using an ELISA as a HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) TestAn indirect ELISA test can be used to see if a patient possesses antibodies to the HIV virus:0 HIV antigen is bound to the bottom of a well in a well plate (a plastic tray with loads of little circular pits in it).\u00a9 A sample of the patient's blood plasma, which might contain several different antibodies, is added to the well.If there are any HIV-specific antibodies (i.e. antibodies against HIV) these will bind to the HIV antigen stuck to the bottom of the well. The well is then washed out to remove any unbound antibodies.(3) A secondary antibody, that has a specific enzyme attached to it, is added to the well.This secondary antibody can bind to the HIV-specific antibody (which is also called the primary antibody).The well is washed out again to remove any unbound secondary antibody. If there's no primary antibody in the sample, all of the secondary antibody will be washed away.(?) A solution is added to the well. This solution contains a substrate, which is able to react with the enzyme attached to the secondary antibody and produce a coloured product. If the solution changes colour, it indicates that the patient has HIV-specific antibodies in their blood and is infected with HIV.antibody specific to HIV antigenantibody not specific to HIV antigenHIVantigensecondary antibody with attached enzymecolour change = HIV is present (positive result)wash out 1= 0vXwash out(T) HIV antigen bound to bottom of the well(2) plasma sample added@ secondary antibody added(J) substrate addeds\\l I II II II II II I I I II I I I I i M II 11 \\ I I I I I I I I I I i H I I II M I II i II I I I I I I I i it I I\/, ~ The washing steps are important to make sure unbound antibodies aren't left in 3 5 the well which could affect the results.

They're not even living things \u2014 they can only reproduce inside the cells of another organism (called the host). All viruses cause disease, and you need to know all about one particularly nasty blighter...HIV is the Virus That Causes AIDS1) HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that affects the immune system.It eventually leads to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).2) AIDS is a condition where the immune system deteriorates and eventually fails. This makes someone with AIDS more vulnerable to other infections, like pneumonia (see next page).3) HIV infects (and eventually kills) helperT-cells, which act as the host cells (see p. 28) for the virus. Remember, helper T-cells send chemical signals that activate phagocytes, cytotoxic T-cells and B-cells (see p. 44) so they're hugely important cells in the immune response. Without enough helper T-cells, the immune system is unable to mount an effective response to infections because other immune system cells don't behave how they should.4) People infected with HIV develop AIDS when the helper T-cell numbers in their body reach a critically low level.HIV has a Spherical StructureYou might get asked about the structure of HIV in your exam1) A core that contains the genetic material (RNA) and some proteins (including the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is needed for virus replication).2) An outer coating of protein called a capsid.3) An extra outer layer called an envelope. This is made of membrane stolen from the cell membrane of a previous host cell.4) Sticking out from the envelope are loads of copies of an attachment protein that help HIV attach to thehost helper T-cell.HIV Replicates Inside its Host\u2019s Helper T-CellsHIV (and all other viruses) can only reproduce inside the cells of the organism it has infected. HIV replicates inside the helper T-cells of the host. It doesn't have the equipment (such as enzymes and ribosomes) to replicate on its own, so it uses those of the host cell.Here's how HIV replicates:1) The attachment protein attaches to a receptor molecule on the cell membrane of the host helper T-cell.2) The capsid is released into the cell, where it uncoats and releases the genetic material (RNA) into the cell's cytoplasm.3) Inside the cell, reverse transcriptase is used to make a complementary strand of DNA from the viral RNA template (see p. 16-17 for more on DNA and RNA).4) From this, double-stranded DNA is made and inserted into the human DNA.5) Host cell enzymes are used to make viral proteins from theviral DNA found within the human DNA.6) The viral proteins are assembled into new viruses, which bud from the cell and go on to infect other cells.During the initial infection period, HIV replicates rapidly and the infected person may experience severe flu-likesymptoms. After this period, HIV replication drops to a lower level. This is the latency period. During the latency period (which can last for years), the infected person won't experience any symptoms.Topic 2C \u2014 Cells and the Immune System\u00a9HIVhelper T cellDNA\u00a9\u00aev \u201c \u201c  DAttachment protein CapsidS1 , \" \"........................u-n,,,,,._ ttachnient proteins can also -EnvelopeGeneticmaterialReverse transcriptase\n53HIV and VirusesPeople with AIDS are Susceptible to a Range of IllnessesPeople with HIV are classed as having AIDS when symptoms of their failing immune system start to appear or their helper T-cell count drops below a certain level. People with AIDS generally develop diseases that wouldn't cause serious problems in people with a healthy immune system. The length of time between infection with HIV and the development of AIDS varies between individuals but without treatment it's usually around 10 years.1) The initial symptoms of AIDS include minor infections of mucous membranes (e.g. the inside of the nose, ears and genitals), and recurring respiratory infections.2) As AIDS progresses the number of immune system cells decreases further.Patients become susceptible to more serious infections including chronic diarrhoea, severe bacterial infections and tuberculosis.3) During the late stages of AIDS patients have a very low number of immune system cells and can develop a range of serious infections such as toxoplasmosis of the brain (a parasite infection) and candidiasis of the respiratory system (fungal infection). It's these serious infections that kill AIDS patients, not HIV itself.M r11\" M 1,1 \"ii\/- ^ infections become -Z m\u00b0J and \u2122ore serious = r 93 there are fewer and - mmune system ~\u00ab!'s to them. J11111 \/11- fewer1 111111 11 \/ IThe length of time that people survive with AIDS varies a lot. Factors that affect progression of HIV to AIDS and survival time with AIDS include existing infections, the strain of HIV they're infected with, age and access to healthcare.Antibiotics Don\u2019t Work Against Viruses1) Antibiotics kill bacteria by interfering with their metabolic reactions.They target the bacterial enzymes and ribosomes used in these reactions.2) Bacterial enzymes and ribosomes are different from human enzymes and ribosomes. Antibiotics are designed to only target the bacterial ones so they don't damage human cells. Makes sense.3) Viruses don't have their own enzymes and ribosomes \u2014 they use the ones in the host's cells. So becausehuman viruses use human enzymes and ribosomes to replicate, antibiotics can't inhibit them because theydon't target human processes.4) Most antiviral drugs are designed to target the few virus-specific enzymes (enzymes that only the virus uses) that exist. For example, HIV uses reverse transcriptase to replicate (see previous page). Human cells don't use this enzyme so drugs can be designed to inhibit it without affecting the host cell. These drugs are called reverse-transcriptase inhibitors.There\u2019s No Cure for HIV1) There's currently no cure or vaccine for HIV but antiviral drugs can be used to slow down the progression of HIV infection and AIDS in an infected person.2) The best way to control HIV infection in a population is by reducing its spread. HIV can be spread via unprotected sexual intercourse, through infected bodily fluids (e.g. like blood from sharing contaminated needles) and from a HIV-positive mother to her fetus. Not all babies from HIV-positive mothers are born infected with HIV and taking antiviral drugs during pregnancy can reduce the chance of the baby being HIV-positive.Practice Questions- V testing, based on HIV '- anybody detection, before a =- baby is 18 months old can be \u00a3 \u00a3 inaccurate.

Imagine these animals as cubes:The hippo could be represented by a block measuring2 cm x 4 cm x 4 cm.Its volume is 2 x 4 x 4 = 32 cm3Its surface area is 2 x 4 x 4 = 32 cm2 (top and bottom surfaces of cube)+ 4x2x4 = 32 cm2 (four sides of the cube)Total surface area = 64 cm2So the hippo has a surface area: volume ratio of 64:32 or 2:1.^ ^ ^ ^\"cube hippo\"1 cm 1 cm\"cube mouse\"Compare this to a cube mouse measuring 1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm. -Its volume is 1 x 1 x 1 = 1 cm3 Its surfacc area is 6 x 1 x 1 = 6 cm2 So the mouse has a surface area: volume ratio of 6:1.s\\'( M 1 1 1 I \u2019 II I I I I I M I I I I I I I | I\/, The cube mouse's surface area - is six times its volume, but the r cube hippo's surface area is - only twice its volume.

The diffusion rate is quick because of the small distances the substances have to travel (see p. 39).2) In multicellular animals, diffusion across the outer membrane is too slow, for two reasons:\u2022 Some cells are deep within the body \u2014 there's a big distance between them and the outside environment.\u2022 Larger animals have a low surface area to volume ratio \u2014 it's difficult to exchange enough substances to supply a large volume of animal through a relatively small outer surface.So rather than using straightforward diffusion to absorb and excrete substances, multicellular animals need specialised exchange organs (like lungs \u2014 see p. 58).They also need an efficient system to carry substances to and from their individual cells \u2014 this is mass transport.In mammals, 'mass transport' normally refers to the circulatory system (see p. 70), which uses blood to carry glucose and oxygen around the body. It also carries hormones, antibodies (p. 44) and waste like CO,.Mass transport in plants involves the transport of water and solutes in the xylem and phloem (see pages 78 and 80).Topic 3 A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n55Size and Surface AreaBody Size and Shape Affect Heat ExchangeAs well as creating waste products that need to be transported away, the metabolic activity inside cells creates heat. Staying at the right temperature is difficult, and it's pretty heavily influenced by your size and shape...SizeThe rate of heat loss from an organism depends on its surface area. If an organism has a large volume, e.g. a hippo, its surface area is relatively small. This makes it harder for it to lose heat from its body. If an organism is small, e.g. a mouse, its relative surface area is large, so heat is lost more easily. This means smaller organisms need a relatively high metabolic rate, in order to generate enough heat to stay warm.Shape1) Animals with a compact shape have a small surface area relative to their volume\u2014 minimising heat loss from their surface.2) Animals with a less compact shape (those that are a bit gangly or have sticky outy bits) have a larger surface area relative to their volume \u2014 this increases heat loss from their surface.3) Whether an animal is compact or not depends on the temperature of its environment. Here's an example:Arctic fox Body temperature 37 \u00b0C Average outside temperature O \u00b0C\u2022X*The Arctic fox has small ears and a round head to reduceits SA : V ratio and heat loss.African bat-eared fox Body temperature 37 \u00b0C Average outside temperature 25 \u00b0CThe African bat-eared fox has large ears and a more pointed nose to increase its SA : V ratio and heat loss.European fox Body temperature 37 \u00b0C Average outside temperature 12 \u00b0Ct* 4The European fox is intermediate between the two, matching the temperature of its environment.Organisms have Behavioural and Physiological Adaptations to Aid ExchangeNot all organisms have a body size or shape to suit their climate \u2014 some have other adaptations instead...1) Animals with a high SA : volume ratio tend to lose more water as it evaporates from their surface.Some small desert mammals have kidney structure adaptations so that they produce less urine to compensate.2) To support their high metabolic rates, small mammals living in cold regions need to eat large amounts of high energy foods such as seeds and nuts.3) Smaller mammals may have thick layers of fur or hibernate when the weather gets really cold.4) Larger organisms living in hot regions, e.g. elephants and hippos, find it hard to keep cool as their heat loss is relatively slow. Elephants have developed large flat ears to increase their surface area, allowing them to lose more heat. Hippos spend much of the day in the water \u2014 a behavioural adaptation to help them lose heat.Practice QuestionsQ1 Give four things that organisms need to exchange with their environment.Q2 Describe how body shape affects heat exchange.Exam QuestionQl Explain why a small mammal needs a relatively high metabolic rate compared to a large mammal.

This movement happens down a pressure gradient. Once in the alveoli, the oxygen diffuses across the alveolar epithelium, then the capillary endothelium,ending up in the capillary itself. This movement happens down a diffusion gradient.The Alveoli are Adapted for Gas ExchangeAlveoli have features that speed up the rate of diffusion so gases can be exchanged quickly:1) A thin exchange surface \u2014 the alveolar epithelium is only one cell thick. -\"see \" 11111\" 11This means there's a short diffusion pathway (which speeds up diffusion). : p\/9es and -- \" for more on ~2) A large surface area \u2014 the large number of alveoli means there's a large - diffusion ~surface area for gas exchange. 1\" 1' m i\/11There's also a steep concentration gradient of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the alveoli and the capillaries, which increases the rate of diffusion.

Well, here are some lovely dissections that you might do. How exciting.You Need to be Able to Carry Out Dissections1) As part of your AS or A level in Biology, you're expected to carry out at least one dissection. It could be a dissection of a gaseous exchange system or a mass transport system (or an organ within one of those systems) in either an animal or a plant. You could also be asked about dissections in your exams.2) There's an example of a plant dissection that you could do on page 79.These two pages cover some animal dissections that you could do as well or instead.3) Whether it's a plant or animal dissection, you're expected to know how to carry it out safely and ethically. You might also need to record your observations using labelled diagrams.You Can Dissect the Gaseous Exchange Systems of AnimalsLungs Can be Dissected To Show the Main Structuresi'111\"1 '111, n i \\i in i ,,i,_ \u00a3 You can learn more about r \u201c the lun1)2)3)4)5)6)3s on pages 58-59.First up, lung dissection is messy, so make sure you're wearing a lab coat. 111'\" '1'1 < \u0000 w i i, \/1 m i ,\/ v-Your dissecting tools (e.g. scalpels, dissecting scissors) should all be clean, sharp and free from rust \u2014 blunt tools don't cut well and can be dangerous.Lay the lungs your teacher has given you on a cutting board. They'll probably be sheep or pig lungs from a butcher's shop. You should be able to see the trachea and two bronchi going into the lungs.To see the lungs inflate, attach a piece of rubber tubing to the trachea and pump air into the lungs using a foot or bicycle pump. The lungs will deflate by themselves because of the elastin in the walls of the alveoli (see p. 61).Never blow down the tube to inflate the lungs \u2014 you could end up sucking up stale air from irside the lungs into your mouth.Pop the lungs in a clear plastic bag before you start to stop bacteria inside the lungs from being released into the room.Once you've seen the lungs inflate, you can examine the different tissue types in the lungs.The trachea is supported by C-shaped rings of cartilage. smooth muscleA cross-section of the trachea looks like this:C-shapedcartilageII I | I 1 \\ I I I M I III I I ' I M 1\/- If you do cut the - Z. cartilage be careful \u2014 you -- need to wear goggles to rprotect your eyes.\/| i \\ i H n 111 w M 111 M i7)8) 9)Cartilage is tough, so if you want to open up the trachea, it's best to cut it lengthways, down the gap in the C-shaped rings. Use dissecting scissors or a scalpel to make the cut. If using a scalpel, cut downwards (not towards you) and don't apply too much pressure to the blade.Continue cutting down one of the bronchi. You should be able to see the bronchioles branching off.Cut off a piece of the lung. The tissue will feel spongy because of the air trapped in all the alveoli.Lungs from a butcher are safe for humans to handle, but they could still contain bacteria that cause food poisoning. That's why it's important to wash your hands after the dissection and disinfect work surfaces.Here\u2019s How to Dissect Fish Gills in Bony Fish1) Again, make sure you're wearing an apron or lab coat.2) Place your chosen fish (something like a perch or salmon works well) in a dissection tray or on a cutting board.3) Gills are located on either side of the fish's head. They're protected on eachside by a bony flap called an operculum and supported by gill arches.4) To remove the gills, push back the operculum and use scissors to carefully remove the gills. Cut each gill arch through the bone at the top and bottom. They should look a bit like this:5) If you look closely, you should be able to see the gill filaments.N\\\/1 I II I i \/1 I I II I M I I II I II 11 u u 111 i ii I I II I M II I i u I II I II II n I I I I I I I I I 11^- For more nformation about the structure and function of fish gills, see page 56. - 1 w n 11 H ' i u 11 h 11 h 11111111 m i m i m 111 m 111 ii m i w i m 11 m w n ^A single gill archoperculum (the gills are under here)\ngill filamentsTopic 3 A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n65Dissecting Gas Exchange SystemsYou Can Dissect the Gaseous Exchange System in Insects tooBig insects like grasshoppers or cockroaches are usually best for dissecting because they're easier to handle.

You should be able to see a network of very thin, silvery-grey tubes \u2014 these are the tracheae. They look silver because they're filled with air.You can examine the tracheae under an optical microscope using a temporary mount slide (see p. 30). Again, the tracheae will appear silver or grey.

Here are some points to think about:1) Some people argue that it is morally wrong to kill animals just for dissections, as it is unnecessary killing. However many dissections that are carried out in schools involve animals that have already been killed for their meat, e.g. the sheep's lung dissection on the previous page. (Some people disagree with killing animals altogether though.)2) There are concerns that the animals used for dissections are not always raised in a humane way \u2014 they may be subject to overcrowding, extremes of temperature or lack of food \u2014 and they may not be killed humanely either. If animals (e.g. insects) are raised in school for dissection, it's important to make sure they are looked after properly and killed humanely to minimise any suffering or distress.Practice QuestionsQ1 Why is it important that dissecting tools are sharp?Q2 Describe how to remove the gills in a bony fish.Exam QuestionsQ1 A student is examining grasshopper tracheae under the microscope. The tracheae were taken from a preservedgrasshopper specimen. The grasshopper was killed some time ago and kept in a liquid preservative.The tracheae do not appear silver under the microscope.

Dissections are all about cutting open organisms, so you can see everything you've been learning about and hopefully understand it better. You should be able to apply your knowledge of gas exchange systems (see pages 56-59) to any dissections you get asked about in the exams.Topic 3A \u2014 Exchange and Transport Systems\n","30":"66 Topic 3BMore Exchange and Transport SystemsDigestion and AbsorptionThe whole point of digestion is to break down the food you eat into small molecules that your cells can absorb. As you might imagine, this involves loads of different chemical reactions and our old friends, enzymes.Food is Broken Down into Smaller Molecules During Digestion1) The large biological molecules (e.g. starch, proteins) in food are too big to cross cell membranes.This means they can't be absorbed from the gut into the blood.2) During digestion, these large molecules are broken down into smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, amino acids), which can move across cell membranes. This means they can be easily absorbed from the gut into the blood, to be transported around the body for use by the body cells.3) You might remember from Topic 1 A, that most large biological molecules are polymers, which can be broken down into smaller molecules (monomers) using hydrolysis reactions.Hydrolysis reactions break bonds by adding water.4) During hydrolysis, carbohydrates are broken down into disaccharides and then monosaccharides.Fats are broken down into fatty acids and monoglycerides. Proteins are broken down into amino acids.Digestive Enzymes are Used to Break Down Biological Molecules in Food1) A variety of different digestive enzymes are produced by specialised cells in the digestive systems of mammals. These enzymes are then released into the gut to mix with food.2) Since enzymes only work with specific substrates (see page 11), different enzymes are needed to catalyse the breakdown of different food molecules.Carbohydrates are Broken Down by Amylase and Membrane-Bound Disaccharidases1) Amylase is a digestive enzyme that catalyses the conversion of starch (a polysaccharide) into the smaller sugar maltose (a disaccharide). This involves the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds in starch.2) Amylase is produced by the salivary glands (which release amylase into the mouth) and also by the pancreas (which releases amylase into the small intestine).3) Membrane-bound disaccharidases are enzymes that are attached to the cell membranes of epithelial cellslining the ileum (the final part of the small intestine). They help to break down disaccharides (e.g. maltose, sucrose and lactose) into monosaccharides (e.g. glucose, fructose and galactose). Again, this involves the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds.<v\\u i \" i J1111111111 \/ I i, l I I I 11111,~ There s more on polysaccharides, tl ~ disaccharides and monosaccharides \u2014- on pages 2-5. \"\/> 111111' 11 n w i \/ it 1111111111 n4) Monosaccharides can be transported across the cell membranes of the ileum epithelial cells via specific transporter proteins (see next page).DisaccharideDisaccharidaseMonosaccharide Productsmaltosemaltaseglucose + glucosesucrosesucraseglucose + fructoselactoselactaseglucose + galactoseLipids are Broken Down by Lipase (with the Help of Bile Salts)1) Lipase enzymes catalyse the breakdown of lipids into monoglycerides and fatty acids. This involves the hydrolysis of the ester bonds in lipids.2) Lipases are made in the pancreas. They work in the small intestine.3) Bile salts are produced by the liver and emulsify lipids \u2014 this means they cause the lipids to form small droplets.4) Bile salts are really important in the process of lipid digestion. Several small lipid droplets have a bigger surface area than a single large droplet (for the same volume of lipid). So the formation of small droplets greatly increases the surface area of lipid that's available for lipases to work on.\u00a3 monoglyceride is a C- glycerol molecule with \u00a3 ~ one fatty acid attached =\nemulsificationbile saltsbiglipid dropletA \/V,\/ lipase digestion\u00b0o\u00b0of lipidsmall lipid dropletsmonoglycerides & fatty acids \u00b00\u00b0\u00b00 micelles5) Once the lipid has been broken down, the monoglycerides and fatty acids stick with the bile salts to form tiny structures called micelles.Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n67Digestion and AbsorptionProteins are Broken Down by Endopeptidases and ExopeptidasesProteins are broken down by a combination of different proteases (or peptidases). These are enzymes that catalyse the conversion of proteins into amino acids by hydrolysing the peptide bonds between amino acids.You need to know about endopeptidases and exopeptidases (including dipeptidases):Endopeptidases act to hydrolyse peptide bonds within a protein. '' L11111!'''11 ['11111' n 11 it-r ^ \u2019 7 r r 1 r Remember: endopeptidases -Trypsin and chymotrypsin are two examples of endopeptidases. r break bonds inside the protein -They're synthesised in the pancreas and secreted into the small intestine.

It's released into the stomach by cells in the stomach lining.Pepsin only works in acidic conditions \u2014 these are provided by hydrochloric acid in the stomach.Exopeptidases act to hydrolyse peptide bonds at the ends of protein molecules.They remove single amino acids from proteins.Dipeptidases are exopeptidases that work specifically on dipeptides. They act to separate the two amino acids that make up a dipeptide by hydrolysing the peptide bond between them.Dipeptidases are often located in the cell-surface membrane of epithelial cells in the small intestine.The Products of Digestion are Absorbed Across Cell MembranesThe products of digestion are absorbed across the ileum epithelium into the bloodstream.Monosaccharides\u2022 Glucose is absorbed by active transport with sodium ions via a co-transporter protein(see page 43). Galactose is absorbed in the same way using the same co-transporter protein.\u2022 Fructose is absorbed via facilitated diffusion through a different transporter protein.Monoglycerides and fatty acidsMicelles (see previous page) help to move monoglycerides and fatty acids towards the epithelium. Because micelles constantly break up and reform they can 'release' monoglycerides and fatty acids, allowing them to be absorbed \u2014 whole micelles are not taken up across the epithelium. Monoglycerides and fatty acids are lipid-soluble, so can diffuse directly across the epithelial cell membrane.Amino acidsAmino acids are absorbed in a similar way to glucose and galactose. Sodium ions are actively transported out of the epithelial cells into the ileum itself. They then diffuse back into the cells through sodium-dependent transporter proteins in the epithelial cell membranes, carrying the amino acids with them.Practice QuestionsQ1 What is the function of amylase in digestion?Q2 Describe the role of bile salts in lipid digestion.Exam QuestionQ1 Some people suffer from lactose intolerance.This can be caused by an inability to break down lactose in the upper small intestine.a) Suggest which disaccharidase enzyme is deficient or missing in people who are lactose-intolerant. [1 mark]b) How are the digestion products of lactose absorbed across the epithelial cells of the ileum? [2 marks]Crikey, this all looks a bit tricky to digest... belch...Don't panic. There's a lot to take in here but as long as you break it clown a bit (ha, just like digestion) then it's not too bad. You can't escape learning what all the enzymes act on, but helpfully their names are usually linked to what they do \u2014 maltase breaks down maltose, dipeptidases break down dipeptides. See, it's not as bad as it looks...Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n","31":"68HaemoglobinHaemoglobin's a protein that carries oxygen around the body.

As well as being found in all vertebrates, haemoglobin is found in earthworms, starfish, some insects, some plants and even in some bacteria.Haemoglobin Saturation Depends on the Partial Pressure of Oxygen1) The partial pressure of oxygen (p02) is a measure of oxygen concentration.The greater the concentration of dissolved oxygen in cells, the higher the partial pressure.2) Similarly, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pC02) is a measure of the concentration of CO, in a cell.3) Haemoglobin's affinity for oxygen varies depending on the partial pressure of oxygen:Oxygen loads onto haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin where there's a hi;Oxyhaemoglobin unloads its oxygen where there's a lower p02.4) Oxygen enters blood capillaries at the alveoli in the lungs. Alveoli have a high p02 so oxygen loads onto haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin.5) When cells respire, they use up oxygen \u2014 this lowers the pOr Red blood cells deliver oxyhaemoglobin to respiring tissues, where it unloads its oxygen6) The haemoglobin then returns to the lungs to pick up more oxygen.There was no use pretending \u2014 the partial pressure of CH., had just increased, and Keith knew who was to blame.Dissociation Curves Show How Affinity for Oxygen VariesA dissociation curve shows how saturated the haemoglobin is with oxygen at any given partial pressure.slll I I M M I III W I I I I I I II I \/\/,- 100% saturation means C- every haemoglobin molecule f~ is carrying the maximum -- of 4 molecules of oxygen. \u2014'\/1 I II I I M I II II M J 1 I II I I I IX\\U I I I II H I I I M I II M I I I M I l\/y- 0% saturation means none 3r of the haemoglobin molecules 5are carrying any oxygen. -\"'n I I M I i w I I I I II II 11 n I I 11The graph is 'S-shaped' because when haemoglobin (Hb) combines with the first 02 molecule, its shape alters in a way that makes it easier for other molecules to join too. But as the Hb starts to become saturated, it gets harder for more oxygen molecules to join. As a result, the curve has a steep bit in the middle where it's really easy for oxygen molecules to join, and shallow bits at each end where it's harder. When the curve is steep, a small change in p02 causes a big change in the amount of oxygen carried by the Hb.D.'Sg.o.g^i.p.D..Cv.rve,fpr..A<jM.ltHuman Haemoglobin\n\u201cI----1------1----r2 4 6 8 10partial pressure of 02 \/ kPaWhere p02 is high (e.g. in the lungs), haemoglobin has a high affinity for oxygen (i.e. it will readily combine with oxygen), so it has a high saturation of oxygen.Where p02 is low (e.g. in respiring tissues), haemoglobin has a low affinity for oxygen, which means it releases oxygen rather than combines with it. That's why it has a low saturation of oxygen.\nTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n69HaemoglobinCarbon Dioxide Concentration Affects Oxygen UnloadingTo complicate matters, haemoglobin gives up its oxygen more readily at higher partial pressures of carbon dioxide (pC02).It's a cunning way of getting more oxygen to cells during activity. \u00a7ku- x1) When cells respire they produce carbon dioxide, \u00b0 ^which raises the pCOr % *2) This increases the rate of oxygen unloading (i.e. the rate Jj ^at which oxyhaemoglobin dissociates to form haemoglobin ^and oxygen) \u2014 so the dissociation curve 'shifts' right.The saturation of blood with oxygen is lower for a given p02, meaning that more oxygen is being released.3) This is called the Bohr effect.Haemoglobin is Different in Different OrganismsDifferent organisms have different types of haemoglobin with different oxygen transporting capacities. Having a particular type of haemoglobin is an adaptation that helps the organism to survive in a particular environment.1) Organisms that live in environments with a low concentration of oxygen have haemoglobin with a higher affinity for oxygen than human haemoglobin \u2014 the dissociation curve is to the left of ours.2) Organisms that are very active and have a high oxygen demand have haemoglobin with a lower affinity for oxygen than human haemoglobin \u2014 the curve is to the right of the human one.A = animal living in depleted oxygen environment, e.g. a lugworm.B = animal living at high altitude where the partial pressure ofoxygen is lower, e.g. a llama in the Andes.C = human dissociation curve.D = active animal with a high respiratory rate living where there's plenty of available oxygen, e.g. a hawk.of oxygen \/ kPaPractice QuestionsQ1 How many oxygen molecules can each haemoglobin molecule carry?Q2 Where in the body would you find a low partial pressure of oxygen?Q3 Why are oxygen dissociation curves S-shaped?Exam QuestionQI a) Haemoglobin is a protein with a quaternary structure.Explain what this means.

A drop of iodine in potassium iodide is put into each well on a spotting tile. A known concentration of amylase and starch are then mixed together in a test tube. A dropping pipette is used to put a drop of this mixture into one of the wells containing the iodine solution on the spotting tile at regular intervals and the resulting colour is observed. The iodine solution goes dark blue-black when starch is present but remains its normal browny-orange colour when there's no starch around.

Repeat the experiment using different concentrations of amylase. Make sure that you also repeat the experiment three times at each amylase concentration.The experiments above show you how you can investigate the effects of temperature and enzyme concentration on the rate of enzyme-controlled reactions. You can also alter these experiments to investigate the effect of a different variable, such as pH (by adding a buffer solution with a different pH to each test tube) or substrate concentration (you could use serial dilutions to make substrate solutions with different concentrations).

Most multicellular organisms (mammals, insects, fish) have a circulatory system of some type.The Circulatory System is a Mass Transport System1) Multicellular organisms, like mammals, have a low surface area to volume ratio (see p. 54), so they need a specialised transport system to carry raw materials from specialised exchange organs to their body cells \u2014 this is the circulatory system.2) The circulatory system is made up of the heart and blood vessels.3) The heart pumps blood through blood vessels (arteries,arterioles, veins and capillaries) to reach different parts of the body. You need to know the names of all the bloodvessels entering and leaving the heart, lungs and kidneys.-4) Blood transports respiratory gases, products of digestion, metabolic wastes and hormones round the body.There are two circuits.One circuit takes blood from the heart to the lungs, then back to the heart.The other loop takes blood around the rest of the body.

The inner lining (endothelium) is folded, allowing the artery to stretch \u2014 this also helps it to maintain high pressure. All arteries carry oxygenated blood except for the pulmonary arteries, which take deoxygenated blood to the lungs.vena cava (deoxygenated blood to heart)rightarteryaorta (oxygenated to body)pulmonary artery (deoxygenated blood to lungs)leftartery\nmuscle layer2) Arteries divide into smaller vessels called arterioles. These form a network throughout the body. Blood is directed to different areas of demand in the body by muscles inside the arterioles, which contract to restrict the blood flow or relax to allow full blood flow.lumen (space in centre)\nlumenthin muscle wall3) Veins take blood back to the heart under low pressure.They have a wider lumen than equivalent arteries, with very little elastic or muscle tissue. Veins contain valves to stop the blood flowing backwards. Blood flow through the veins is helped by contraction of the body muscles surrounding them. All veins carry deoxygenated blood (because oxygen has been used up by body cells), except for the pulmonary veins, which carry oxygenated blood to the heart from the lungs.Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n77The Circulatory SystemSubstances are Exchanged between Blood and Body Tissues at CapillariesArterioles branch into capillaries, which are the smallest of the blood vessels. Substances (e.g. glucose and oxygen) are exchanged between cells and capillaries, so they're adapted for efficient diffusion.1) They're always found very near cells in exchange tissues (e.g. alveoli in the lungs), so there's a short diffusion pathway.2) Their walls are only one cell thick, which also shortens the diffusion pathway.3) There are a large number of capillaries, to increase surface area for, n k) exchange. Networks of capillaries in tissue are called capillary beds.Tissue Fluid is Formed from BloodTissue fluid is the fluid that surrounds cells in tissues. It's made from small molecules that leave the blood plasma, e.g. oxygen, water and nutrients. (Unlike blood, tissue fluid doesn't contain red blood cells or big proteins, because they're too large to be pushed out through the capillary walls.) Cells take in oxygen and nutrients from the tissue fluid, and release metabolic waste into it. In a capillary bed, substances move out of the capillaries, into the tissue fluid, by pressure filtration:1) At the start of the capillary bed, nearest the arteries, the hydrostatic (liquid) pressure inside the capillaries is greater than the hydrostatic pressure in the tissue fluid.2) This difference in hydrostatic pressure means an overall outward pressure forces fluid out of the capillaries and into the spaces around the cells, forming tissue fluid.3) As fluid leaves, the hydrostatic pressure reduces in the capillaries\u2014 so the hydrostatic pressure is much lower at the venule end of the capillary bed (the end that's nearest to the veins).4) Due to the fluid loss, and an increasing concentration of plasma proteins (which don't leave the capillaries), the water potential at the venule end of the capillary bed is lower than the water potential in the tissue fluid.5) This means that some water re-enters the capillaries from the tissue fluid at the venule end by osmosis (see p. 40 for more on osmosis).Blood ___!from arteriolecapillary bed\nwaterAny excess tissue fluid is drained into the lymphatic system(a network of tubes that acts a bit like a drain), which transports this excessfluid from the tissues and dumps it back into the circulatory system.Practice Questions11111\" 11111 n 111 m 111 a i \/\/\/- High blood pressure means a high :- hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries, -- which can lead to an accumulation 2 ^ of tissue fluid in the tissues.\" 111 n I I M I II I I | n I II I | I I i | | | m\\<\"Q1 Name all the blood vessels entering and leaving the heart.Q2 List four types of blood vessel.Q3 Explain why water returns to the capillary at the venule end of the capillary bed.Exam QuestionsQl Describe two structural features of an artery and explain how each feature relates to its function.[4 marks]Q2 At the arteriole end of a capillary bed the hydrostatic pressure is 5.1 kPa in a capillary and 0.13 kPa in the spacearound the cells.

There are certain factors that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.Most Cardiovascular Disease Starts with Atheroma Formationelastic tissue in wall1) The wall of an artery is made up of several layers (see p. 70).2) The endothelium (inner lining) is usually smooth and unbroken.3) If damage occurs to the endothelium (e.g. by high blood pressure) white blood cells (mostly macrophages) and lipids (fat) from the blood, clump together under the lining to form fatty streaks.4) Over time, more white blood cells, lipids and connective tissue build up and harden to form a fibrous plaque called an atheroma.5) This plaque partially blocks the lumen of the artery and restricts blood flow, which causes blood pressure to increase.6) Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a type of cardiovascular disease.It occurs when the coronary arteries have lots of atheromas in them, which restricts blood flow to the heart muscle. It can lead to myocardial infarction (see below).Atheromas Increase the Risk of Aneurysm and ThrombosisTwo types of disease that affect the arteries are:Aneurysm \u2014 a balloon-like swelling of the artery.1) Atheroma plaques damage and weaken arteries.They also narrow arteries, increasing blood pressure.2) When blood travels through a weakened artery at high pressure, it may push the inner layers of the artery through the outer elastic layer to form a balloon-like swelling \u2014 an aneurysm.3) This aneurysm may burst, causing a haemorrhage (bleeding).Thrombosis \u2014 formation of a blood clot.1) An atheroma plaque can rupture (burst through) the endothelium (inner lining) of an artery.2) This damages the artery wall and leaves a rough surface.3) Platelets and fibrin (a protein) accumulate at the site of damage and form a blood clot (a thrombus).4) This blood clot can cause a complete blockage of the artery, or it can become dislodged and block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body.5) Debris from the rupture can cause another blood clot to form further down the artery.Interrupted Blood Flow to the Heart can Cause a Myocardial Infarction1) The heart muscle is supplied with blood by the coronary arteries.2) This blood contains the oxygen needed by heart muscle cells to carry out respiration.3) If a coronary artery becomes completely blocked (e.g. by a blood clot) an area of the heart muscle will be totally cut off from its blood supply, receiving no oxygen.4) This causes a myocardial infarction \u2014 more commonly known as a heart attack.5) A heart attack can cause damage and death of the heart muscle.6) Symptoms include pain in the chest and upper body, shortness of breath and sweating.7) If large areas of the heart are affected complete heart failure can occur, which is often fatal.aneurysmnormal arterythick muscle* layerdeposits of fatty material, dead cells, white blood cells and connective tissuedeposits of fatty material etc. build up and push out endothelium to form an atheromalumen(space in centre)endothelium\nlumen shrinks as artery wall swells, so it's more difficult for blood to pass through\nTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n76Cardiovascular DiseaseSome Factors Increase the Risk of Cardiovascular DiseaseSome of the most common risk factors for cardiovascular disease are:High blood cholesterol and poor diet1) If the blood cholesterol level is high (above 240 mg per 100 cm3) then the risk of cardiovascular disease is increased.2) This is because cholesterol is one of the main constituents of the fatty deposits that form atheromas (see previous page).3) Atheromas can lead to increased blood pressure and blood clots.4) This could block the flow of blood to coronary arteries, which could cause a myocardial infarction (see previous page for details).5) A diet high in saturated fat is associated with high blood cholesterol levels.6) A diet high in salt also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease because it increases the risk of high blood pressure (see below).John decided to live on the edge and ordered a fry-up.G)Cigarette smoking1) Both nicotine and carbon monoxide, found in cigarette smoke, increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.2) Nicotine increases the risk of high blood pressure (see below).3) Carbon monoxide combines with haemoglobin and reduces the amount of oxygen transported in the blood, and so reduces the amount of oxygen available to tissues. If heart muscle doesn't receive enough oxygen it can lead to a heart attack(see previous page).4) Smoking also decreases the amount of antioxidants in the blood \u2014 these are important for protecting cells from damage. Fewer antioxidants means cell damage in the coronary artery walls is more likely, and this can lead to atheroma formation.High blood pressure1) High blood pressure increases the risk of damage to the artery walls.2) Damaged walls have an increased risk of atheroma formation, causing a further increase in blood pressure.3) Atheromas can also cause blood clots to form (see previous page).4) A blood clot could block flow of blood to the heart muscle, possibly resulting in myocardial infarction.5) So anything that increases blood pressure also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, e.g. being overweight, not exercising and excessive alcohol consumption.~ ^ther factors include age ' - (risk increases with age) ~ 5 and sex (men are more at E -v risk than women) - IW||VV\"Most of these factors are within our control \u2014 a person can choose to smoke, eat fatty foods, etc. However, some risk factors can't be controlled, such as having a genetic predisposition to coronary heart disease or having high blood pressure as a result of another condition, e.g. some forms of diabetes. Even so, the risk of developing cardiovascular disease can be reduced by removing as many risk factors as you possibly can.Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n","37":"6LipidsLipids are really nice.

The difference is in their hydrocarbon tails (R group).Saturated fatty acids don't have any double bonds Unsaturated fatty acids have at least one double bondbetween their carbon atoms. The fatty acid is between carbon atoms, which cause the chain to kink.\nsaturated hydrocarbon tail unsaturated hydrocarbon tailPhospholipids are Similar to Triglycerides1) The lipids found in cell membranes aren't triglycerides\u2014 they're phospholipids.2) Phospholipids are pretty similar to triglycerides except one of the fatty acid molecules is replaced by a phosphate group.3) The phosphate group is hydrophilic (attracts water). The fatty acid tails are hydrophobic (repel water). This is important in the cell membrane (see next page to find out why).Structure of a Phospholipid\nTopic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n7LipidsThe Structures of Lipids Relate to Their FunctionsYou need to know how the structures of triglycerides and phospholipids are related to their functions:Triglycerides are mainly used as energy storage molecules. They're good for this because:1) The long hydrocarbon tails of the fatty acids contain lots of chemical energy\u2014 a load of energy is released when they're broken down. Because of these ^ CPtails, lipids contain about twice as much energy per gram as carbohydrates. q ^2) They're insoluble, so they don't affect the water potential (see p. 40) of r,the cell and cause water to enter the cells by osmosis (which would make them ^ ^swell). The triglycerides clump together as insoluble droplets in cells because ^ {\/the fatty acid tails are hydrophobic (water-repelling) \u2014 the tails face inwards, es &shielding themselves from water with their glycerol heads.Phospholipids make up the bilayer of cell membranes (see p. 36).Cell membranes control what enters and leaves a cell.1) Their heads are hydrophilic and their tails are hydrophobic, so they forma double layer with their heads facing out towards the water on either side.2) The centre of the bilayer is hydrophobic, so water-soluble substances can't easily pass through it \u2014 the membrane acts as a barrier to those substances.Use the Emulsion Test for LipidsIf you wanted to find out if there was any fat in aparticular food you could do the emulsion test:1) Shake the test substance with ethanol for about a minute so that it dissolves, then pour the solution into water.2) Any lipid will show up as a milky emulsion.3) The more lipid there is, the more noticeable the milky colour will be.Test substance and ethanolShakesAdd to waterMilky colour indicates lipidPractice QuestionsQ1 What type of bond is made from a condensation reaction between glycerol and a fatty acid molecule?Q2 Describe how you would test for lipids in a solution.Exam QuestionsQ1 Triglycerides have a hydrophobic tail.

It can lead to myocardial infarction (see below).Atheromas Increase the Risk of Aneurysm and ThrombosisTwo types of disease that affect the arteries are:Aneurysm \u2014 a balloon-like swelling of the artery.1) Atheroma plaques damage and weaken arteries.They also narrow arteries, increasing blood pressure.2) When blood travels through a weakened artery at high pressure, it may push the inner layers of the artery through the outer elastic layer to form a balloon-like swelling \u2014 an aneurysm.3) This aneurysm may burst, causing a haemorrhage (bleeding).Thrombosis \u2014 formation of a blood clot.1) An atheroma plaque can rupture (burst through) the endothelium (inner lining) of an artery.2) This damages the artery wall and leaves a rough surface.3) Platelets and fibrin (a protein) accumulate at the site of damage and form a blood clot (a thrombus).4) This blood clot can cause a complete blockage of the artery, or it can become dislodged and block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body.5) Debris from the rupture can cause another blood clot to form further down the artery.Interrupted Blood Flow to the Heart can Cause a Myocardial Infarction1) The heart muscle is supplied with blood by the coronary arteries.2) This blood contains the oxygen needed by heart muscle cells to carry out respiration.3) If a coronary artery becomes completely blocked (e.g. by a blood clot) an area of the heart muscle will be totally cut off from its blood supply, receiving no oxygen.4) This causes a myocardial infarction \u2014 more commonly known as a heart attack.5) A heart attack can cause damage and death of the heart muscle.6) Symptoms include pain in the chest and upper body, shortness of breath and sweating.7) If large areas of the heart are affected complete heart failure can occur, which is often fatal.aneurysmnormal arterythick muscle* layerdeposits of fatty material, dead cells, white blood cells and connective tissuedeposits of fatty material etc. build up and push out endothelium to form an atheromalumen(space in centre)endothelium\nlumen shrinks as artery wall swells, so it's more difficult for blood to pass through\nTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n76Cardiovascular DiseaseSome Factors Increase the Risk of Cardiovascular DiseaseSome of the most common risk factors for cardiovascular disease are:High blood cholesterol and poor diet1) If the blood cholesterol level is high (above 240 mg per 100 cm3) then the risk of cardiovascular disease is increased.2) This is because cholesterol is one of the main constituents of the fatty deposits that form atheromas (see previous page).3) Atheromas can lead to increased blood pressure and blood clots.4) This could block the flow of blood to coronary arteries, which could cause a myocardial infarction (see previous page for details).5) A diet high in saturated fat is associated with high blood cholesterol levels.6) A diet high in salt also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease because it increases the risk of high blood pressure (see below).John decided to live on the edge and ordered a fry-up.G)Cigarette smoking1) Both nicotine and carbon monoxide, found in cigarette smoke, increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.2) Nicotine increases the risk of high blood pressure (see below).3) Carbon monoxide combines with haemoglobin and reduces the amount of oxygen transported in the blood, and so reduces the amount of oxygen available to tissues. If heart muscle doesn't receive enough oxygen it can lead to a heart attack(see previous page).4) Smoking also decreases the amount of antioxidants in the blood \u2014 these are important for protecting cells from damage. Fewer antioxidants means cell damage in the coronary artery walls is more likely, and this can lead to atheroma formation.High blood pressure1) High blood pressure increases the risk of damage to the artery walls.2) Damaged walls have an increased risk of atheroma formation, causing a further increase in blood pressure.3) Atheromas can also cause blood clots to form (see previous page).4) A blood clot could block flow of blood to the heart muscle, possibly resulting in myocardial infarction.5) So anything that increases blood pressure also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, e.g. being overweight, not exercising and excessive alcohol consumption.~ ^ther factors include age ' - (risk increases with age) ~ 5 and sex (men are more at E -v risk than women) - IW||VV\"Most of these factors are within our control \u2014 a person can choose to smoke, eat fatty foods, etc. However, some risk factors can't be controlled, such as having a genetic predisposition to coronary heart disease or having high blood pressure as a result of another condition, e.g. some forms of diabetes. Even so, the risk of developing cardiovascular disease can be reduced by removing as many risk factors as you possibly can.Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n77Cardiovascular DiseaseYou May Have to Interpret Data on Risk Factors and Cardiovascular DiseaseExample: graph shows the results of a study involving 27 939 American women. The LDL cholesterol levelwas measured for each woman. These women were then followed for an average of 8 years and the occurrence of cardiovascular events (e.g. heart attack, surgery on coronary arteries) or death from cardiovascular diseases was recorded. The relative risk of a cardiovascular event, adjusted for other factors that can affect cardiovascular disease, was then calculated.Here are some of the things you might be asked to do:1) Describe the data \u2014 The relative risk of a cardiovascular eventincreases as the level of LDL cholesterol in the blood increases.2) Draw conclusions \u2014 The graph shows a positivecorrelation between the relative risk of a cardiovascular event and the level of LDL cholesterol in the blood.3) Check any conclusions are valid \u2014Make sure any conclusions match the data, e.g.\u2022 This data only looked at women \u2014 no males were involved, so you can't say that this trend is true for everyone.\u2022 You can't say that a high LDL cholesterol level is correlated with an increased risk of heart attacks, because the data shows all first cardiovascular events, including surgery on coronary arteries.\u2022 Also, you can't conclude that a high LDL cholesterol level caused the increased relative risk of a cardiovascular event \u2014 there may be other reasons for the trend.4) Other things to think about \u2014 A large sample size was used (27 939). Data based on large samples is better than data based on small samples. This is because a large sample is more representative of the whole population (i.e. it shares more of the various characteristics of the population).>97.6 >115.4 >132.2-115.4 -132.2 -153.9 Level of LDL cholesterol in blood \/ mg dl'4111111111 m 1111 \/111111 ^ There's more on correlation z \u201c and cause on page 213. -^1 u 11 w 111111111 n 111; 111'>153.9\nYou might also have to evaluate conflicting evidence associated with risk factors affecting cardiovascular disease. E.g. one study might conclude that a factor isn't a health risk, whereas another study might conclude that the same factor is a health risk.1) If two studies have produced conflicting results, think about why that might be. Was it to do withstudy design? Was one study based on a small sample size? Did both studies take into accountother risk factors (variables) that could have affected the results?

When you consider the movement of water, it's all about the xylem. It's pretty exciting stuff...Two Types of Tissue are Involved in Transport in Plants1) Xylem tissue transports water and mineral ions in solution.These substances move up the plant from the roots to the leaves.2) Phloem tissue transports organic substances like sugars (also in solution) bothup and down the plant \u2014 there's more about the phloem on pages 80-81.3) Xylem and phloem are mass transport systems (see page 54) \u2014 they move substances over large distances.Xylem vessels are the part of the xylem tissue that actually transports the water and ions. Xylem vessels are very long, tube-like structures formed from dead cells (vessel elements) joined end to end.

This is because the stomata open when it gets light to let in CO, for photosynthesis. When it's dark the stomata are usually closed, so there's little transpiration.2) Temperature \u2014 the higher the temperature the faster the transpiration rate. Warmer water molecules have more energy so they evaporate from the cells inside the leaf faster. This increases the concentration gradient between the inside and outside of the leaf, making water diffuse out of the leaf faster.3) Humidity \u2014 the lower the humidity, the faster the transpiration rate (i.e. there's a negative correlationbetween humidity and transpiration rate). If the air around the plant is dry, the concentration gradient between the leaf and the air is increased, which increases transpiration.4) Wind \u2014 the windier it is, the faster the transpiration rate. Lots of air movement blows away water molecules from around the stomata. This increases the concentration gradient, which increases the rate of transpiration.water evaporatestension<3 cohesiong) water enters\nTopic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems\n79Transport in Plants \u2014 XylemA Potometer can be Used to Estimate Transpiration RateA potometer is a special piece of apparatus used to estimate transpiration rates. It actually measures water uptake by a plant, but it's assumed that water uptake by the plant is directly related to water loss by the leaves. You can use it to estimate how different factors affect the transpiration rate.Here's what you'd do:Cut a shoot underwater to prevent air from entering the xylem. Cut it at a slant to increase the surface area available for water uptake.Assemble the potometer in water and insert the shoot underwater, so no air can enter.Remove the apparatus from the water but keep the end of the capillary tube submerged in a beaker of water. Check that the apparatus is watertight and airtight.Dry the leaves, allow time for the shoot to acclimatise, and then shut the tap.Remove the end of the capillary tube from the beaker of water until one air bubble has formed, then put the end of the tube back into the water.Record the starting position of the air bubble.Start a stopwatch and record the distance moved by the bubble per unit time, e.g. per hour. The rate of air bubble movement is an estimate of the transpiration rate.Remember, only change one variable (e.g. temperature) at a time. All other conditions (e.g. light, humidity) must be kept constant.You Might Have to Dissect PlantsYou can look at xylem or phloem in plant tissue (e.g. part of a plant stem) under a microscope, and then draw them. But first you need to dissect the plant and prepare a section of the tissue. You can do this using the following method:1) Use a scalpel (or razor blade) to cut a cross-section of the stem. Cut the sections as thinly as possible \u2014 thin sections are better for viewing under a microscope.2) Use tweezers to gently place the cut sections in water until you come to use them. This stops them from drying out.3) Transfer each section to a dish containing a stain, e.g. toluidine blue O (TBO), and leave for one minute. TBO stains the lignin in the walls of the xylem vessels blue-green.This will let you see the position of the xylem vessels and examine their structure.4) Rinse off the sections in water and mount each one onto a slide (see page 30).Practice QuestionsQ1 What is the function of xylem tissue?Q2 Give four factors that affect transpiration rate.Q3 Name a piece of apparatus used to measure transpiration rate.Exam QuestionQ1 a) What is meant by the term transpiration?

I know,; I almost can't contain my excitement. When it comes to the phloem it's all about moving dissolved organic substances around the plant, so it's a bit different to xylem.Phloem Tissue is Adapted for Transporting Solutes1) Solutes are dissolved substances. Phloem tissue transports solutes (mainly sugars like sucrose) round plants. Like xylem, phloem is formed from cells arranged in tubes.2) Sieve tube elements and companion cells are important cell types in phloem tissue:\u2022 Sieve tube elements are living cells that form the tube for transporting solutes. They have no nucleus and few organelles, so...\u2022 ...there's a companion cell for each sieve tube element. They carry out living functions for sieve cells, e.g. providing the energy needed for the active transport of solutes.Translocation is the Movement of Solutes1) Translocation is the movement of solutes (e.g. sugars like sucrose, and amino acids) to where they're needed in a plant. Solutes are sometimes called assimilates.2) It's an energy-requiring process that happens in the phloem.3) Translocation moves solutes from 'sources' to 'sinks'. The source of a solute is where it's made (so it's at a high concentration there). The sink is the area where it's used up (so it's at a lower concentration there).E.g. the source for sucrose is usually the leaves (where it's made), and the sinks are the other parts of the plant, especially the food storage organs and the meristems {areas of growth) in the roots, stems and leaves.4) Enzymes maintain a concentration gradient from the source to the sink by changing the solutes at the sink (e.g. by breaking them down or making them into something else). This makes sure there's always a lower concentration at the sink than at the source.E.g. in potatoes, sucrose is converted to starch in the sink areas, so there's always a lower concentration of sucrose at the sink than inside the phloem. This makes sure a constant supply of new sucrose reaches the sink from the phloem.The Mass Flow Hypothesis Best Explains Phloem TransportScientists still aren't certain exactly how the solutes are transported from source to sink by translocation. The best supported theory is the mass flow hypothesis:1) Active transport (see p. 42) is used to actively load the solutes (e.g. sucrose from photosynthesis) from companion cells into the sieve tubes of the phloem at the source (e.g. the leaves).2) This lowers the water potential inside the sieve tubes, so water enters the tubes by osmosis from the xylem and companion cells.3) This creates a high pressure inside the sieve tubes at the source end of the phloem.1) At the sink end, solutes are removed from the phloem to be used up.2) This increases the water potential inside the sieve tubes, so water also leaves the tubes by osmosis.3) This lowers the pressure inside the sieve tubes.(j) SOURCElow water potential, high pressurewater flow solute flow\u00a9sieve plate plasmodesma\u2014Water flows to xylem(2) SINK high water potential,\u00ae1) The result is a pressure gradient from the source end to the sink end.

The fluid from the bulge has a higher concentration of sugars than the fluid from below the ring \u2014 this is evidence that there's a downward flow of sugars.A radioactive tracer such as radioactive carbon (l4C) can be used to track the movement of organic substances in a plant (see below).Pressure in the phloem can be investigated using aphids (they pierce the phloem, then their bodies are removed leaving the mouthparts behind, which allows the sap to flow out... gruesome). The sap flows out quicker nearer the leaves than further down the stem \u2014 this is evidence that there's a pressure gradient.If a metabolic inhibitor (which stops ATP production) is put into the phloem, then translocation stops \u2014 this is evidence that active transport is involved.Sugar travels to many different sinks, not just to the one with the highest water potential, as the model would suggest._\\W \" I \/1 1 M I 11 H I ll \/; | \/ f 11 i \/11 11\/You could get asked about '__ correlations and casual relationships \u0000TU \u2022 | 4 I I , . , r, .

One example is carbon dioxide containing the radioactive isotope 14C. This radioactively-labelled COcan be supplied to a single leaf by being pumped into a container which completely surrounds the leaf.2) The radioactive carbon will then be incorporated into organic substances produced by the leaf (e.g. sugars produced by photosynthesis), which will be moved around the plant by translocation.3) The movement of these substances can be tracked using a technique called f^^,e,(; iS: autoradiography. To reveal where the radioactive tracer has spread to in a plant, the plant is killed (e.g. by freezing it using liquid nitrogen) and then the whole plant (or sections of it) is placed on photographic film\u2014 the radioactive substance is present wherever the film turns black.4) The results demonstrate the translocation of substances from source to sink over time \u2014 for example, autoradiographs of plants killed at different times show an overall movement of solutes (e.g. products of photosynthesis) from the leaves towards the roots.Autoradiograph of plant showing how radioactivity has spread from the leaf.Practice QuestionsLeaf exposed to MCO. gasQ1 According to the mass flow hypothesis, how is a pressure gradient set up in the phloem?Exam QuestionQ1 A scientist is investigating where the products of photosynthesis are translocated to in a plant.

Chromosomes are found in the nucleus.The DNA molecule is really long so, it has to be wound up so it can fit into the nucleus.The DNA molecule is wound around proteins called histones.Histone proteins also help to support the DNA.The DNA (and protein) is then coiled up very tightly to make a compact chromosome.DNA double-helixDNA Histone proteins A single chromosomeDNA wound around histone proteinsDNA with the protein is coiled up repeatedly= Eukary\u00b0t'c cells include - Z a\"'\u2122al and p|ant ce|)s r r \u201cr\u00b0karyotir cells are -My bacteria. =1111 111 111 i\\\\~6)The mitochondria and chloroplasts in eukaryotic cells also have their own DNA.

It's the order of bases in a gene that determines the order of amino acids in a particular polypeptide.4) Each amino acid is coded for by a sequence of three bases in a gene called a triplet, i :-^5s>5) To make a polypeptide, DNA is first copied into messenger RNA (mRNA).This is the first stage of protein synthesis (see p. 84).6) Genes that don't code for a polypeptide code for functional RNA instead.

These sections of DNA are called introns.There can be several introns within a gene.All the bits or a gene that do code for amino acids are called exons.Introns are removed during protein synthesis \u2014 so they don't affect the amino acid order. Their purpose isn't known for sure. (Prokaryotic DNA doesn't have introns.)Eukaryotic DNA also contains regions of multiple repeats outside of genes.These are DNA sequences that repeat over and over.

For example, the gene that determines blood type exists as one of three alleles \u2014 one determines type O, another type A and the other type B.In a eukaryotic cell nucleus, DNA is stored as chromosomes.Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, 46 in total \u2014 two number 1s, two number 2s, two number 3s, etc. Pairs of matching chromosomes (e.g. the 1s) are called homologous pairs.In a homologous pair, both chromosomes are the same size and have the same genes, although they could have different alleles.

[2 marks]Exons stay in. introns go out, in. out, in. out, and shake it all about...Quite a few terms to learn here, I'm afraid. Some are a bit confusing too. lust try to remember which way round they go. Introns are the non-coding regions, but exons are extremely important \u2014 they actually code for the polypeptide.Topic 4A \u2014 DNA., RNA and Protein Synthesis\n","42":"84RNA and Protein SynthesisProtein synthesis involves two stages \u2014 transcription and translation. They both involve RNA.There\u2019s More Than One Type of RNARemember, RNA is a single polynucleotide strand and it contains uracil (U) as a base instead of thymine (see p. 16). Uracil always pairs with adenine during protein synthesis. RNA isn't all the same though. You need to know about:(Messenger RNA (mRNA))mRNA is made during transcription (see below). It carries the genetic code from the DNA to the ribosomes, where it's used to make a protein during translation (see next page). mRNA is a single ^ Basepolynucleotide strand.In mRNA, groups of three adjacent bases are usually called codons (they're sometimes Phosphate called triplets or base triplets). Ribose sugarvcodon(Transfer RNA (tRNA))tRNA is involved in translation. It carries the amino acids that are used to make proteins to the ribosomes. tRNA is a single polynucleotide strand that's folded into a clover shape. Hydrogen bonds between specific base pairs hold the molecule in this shape.Every tRNA molecule has a specific sequence of three bases at one end called an anticodon.They also have an amino acid binding site at the other end.AnticodonAmino acid binding siteHydrogen bonds between base pairsFirst Stage of Protein Synthesis \u2014  TranscriptionDuring transcription, an mRNA copy of a gene is made from DNA.In eukaryotic cells, transcription takes place in the nucleus.(Prokaryotes don't have a nucleus, so transcription takes place in the cytoplasm.Transcription starts when RNA polymerase (an enzyme) attaches to the DNA double-helix at the beginning of a gene.The hydrogen bonds between the two DNA strands in the gene break, separating the strands, and the DNA molecule uncoils at that point, exposing some of the bases.One of the strands is then used as a template to make an mRNA copy.vma\\|Cytopla1)2)RNA j polymerase;f \/T |Nucleusl|Template \/ strand of DNA3)RNA njcleotides joined togethernucleotides4)5)The RNA polymerase lines up free RNA nucleotides alongside the exposed bases on the template strand. The free bases are attracted to the exposed bases. Specific, complementary base pairing (see p. 17) means that the mRNA strand ends up being a complementary copy of the DNA template strand (except the base T is replaced by U in RNA). Once the RNA nucleotides have paired up with their ( specific bases on the DNA strand, they're joined together5^ by RNA polymerase, forming an mRNA molecule.6) The RNA polymerase moves along the DNA, separating the strands and assembling the mRNA strand. \u0000=\u2014=\u00a7\u00007) The hydrogen bonds between the uncoiled strands of DNA re-form once the RNA polymerase has passed by and the strands coil back into a double-helix.Direction RNA| polymerase is movingi\\CGAAUCAAGGAG i i i i i i^^Nuclearpore) mRNA strand leaves nucleus and enters the cytoplasmI\u00a3 In eukaryotes, it's actually ; ~ a complex of proteins ;2 including a DNA helicase I Z that separates the strands. - Z RNA polymerase just I\" assembles the mRNA ;^ strand. :11 ii ii \/11 u 11111 ii i 118) When RNA polymerase reaches a particular sequence of DNA called a stop signal, it stops making mRNA and detaches from the DNA.9) In eukaryotes, mRNA moves out of the nucleus through a nuclear pore and attaches to a ribosome in the cytoplasm, where the next stage of protein synthesis takes place (see next page).Topic 4A \u2014 DNA, RNA and Protein Synthesis\n85RNA and Protein SynthesisTranscription Makes Different Products in Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes1) In eukaryotes, the introns and exons are both copied into mRNA during transcription. mRNA strands containing introns and exons are called pre-mRNA. A process called splicing then occurs \u2014 introns are removed and the exons joined together \u2014 forming mRNA strands. This takes place in the nucleus.The mRNA then leaves the nucleus for the next stage of protein synthesis (translation). 1 n ' n 111 n2) In prokaryotes, mRNA is produced directly from the DNA \u2014 without splicing taking place. ~ Turn to page 33 ^(There's no need for splicing because there are no introns in prokaryotic DNA.) ~ ^or more on -and exo\"s =Second Stage of Protein Synthesis \u2014  TranslationUIn both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, translation occurs at the ribosomes in the cytoplasm.During translation, amino acids are joined together to make a polypeptide chain (protein), following the sequence of codons (triplets) carried by the mRNA.1) The mRNA attaches itself to a ribosome and transfer RNA {tRNAi molecules carry amino acids to it.ATP provides the energy needed for the bond between the amino acid and the tRNA molecule to form.2) A tRNA molecule (carrying an amino acid), with an anticodon that's complementary to the first codon on the mRNA, attaches itself to the mRNA by specific base pairing3) A second tRNA molecule attaches itself to the next codon on the mRNA in the same way.4) The two amino acids attached to the tRNA molecules are joined by a peptide bond The first tRNA molecule moves away, leaving its amino acid behind.5) A third tRNA molecule binds to the next codon on the mRNA.Its amino acid binds to the first two and the second tRNA molecule moves away.6) This process continues, producing a chain of linked amino acids (a polypeptide chain), until there's a stop signal on the mRNA molecule.7) The polypeptide chain moves away from the ribosome and translation is complete.anticodon on tRNAcodon ^ on mRNA i\u2014\u20141\u2014AU\u201cICG_l.......................................: rrotem synthesis zJ is also called ' Peptide synthesis. =1'1 \" '1II \/ \/1 \/, I ,,togetherEmpty tRNA molecules move away from the ribosome, leaving behind their amino acid%Complementary A anticodon ontRNACodon on mRNARibosomemRNADirection ribosome is movingPolypeptide chain formingAmino acids joined\nPractice QuestionsQ1 Describe the structure of tRNA.Q2 Where does transcription take place in eukaryotes?Exam QuestionQ1 A drug that inhibits cell growth is found to be able to bind to DNA, preventingRNA polymerase from binding.

These pages show you how to measure the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction.You can Measure the Rate of an Enzyme-Controlled ReactionHere are two ways of measuring the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction:1) You Can Measure How Fast the Product of the Reaction is MadeCatalase catalyses the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. It's easy to measure the volume of oxygen produced and to work out how fast it's given off. The diagram below shows the apparatus you'll need. The oxygen released displaces the water from the measuring cylinder. (A stand and clamp would also be pretty useful to hold the cylinder upside down, as would a stopwatch and a water bath.)Here's how to carry out the experiment:1)2)3)4)5)6)7)Set up boiling tubes containing the same volume and concentration of hydrogen peroxide.To keep the pH constant, add equal volumes of a suitable buffer solution to each tube.(A buffer solution is able to resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or alkali are added.)Set up the rest of the apparatus as shown in the diagram.Put each boiling tube in a water bath set to aupside down measuring cylindervolume ofdelivery tubeboiling tubehydrogen peroxide solution and catalase enzymeoxygen produced per minute is measuredtrough of <'*== waterdifferent temperature (e.g. 10 \u00b0C, 20 \u00b0C, 30 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C) along with another tube containing catalase (wait 5 minutes before moving onto the next step so the enzyme gets up to temperature).Use a pipette to add (he same volume and concentration of catalase to each boiling tube. Then quickly attach the bung and delivery tube.Record how much oxygen is produced in the first minute (60 s) of the reaction. Use a stopwatch to measure the time.Repeat the experiment at each temperature three times, and use the results to find an average volume of oxygen produced.Calculate the average rate of reaction at each temperature by dividing the volume of oxygen produced by the time taken (i.e. 60 s).

The diagram shows how the experiment can be set up. You'll need the apparatus shown in the diagram as well as a stopwatch. A drop of iodine in potassium iodide is put into each well on a spotting tile. A known concentration of amylase and starch are then mixed together in a test tube. A dropping pipette is used to put a drop of this mixture into one of the wells containing the iodine solution on the spotting tile at regular intervals and the resulting colour is observed. The iodine solution goes dark blue-black when starch is present but remains its normal browny-orange colour when there's no starch around. You can see how fast amylase is working by recording how long it takes for the iodine solution to no longer turn blue-black when starch\/amylase mixture is added. Repeat the experiment using different concentrations of amylase. Make sure that you also repeat the experiment three times at each amylase concentration.The experiments above show you how you can investigate the effects of temperature and enzyme concentration on the rate of enzyme-controlled reactions. You can also alter these experiments to investigate the effect of a different variable, such as pH (by adding a buffer solution with a different pH to each test tube) or substrate concentration (you could use serial dilutions to make substrate solutions with different concentrations). The key to experiments like this is to remember to only change one variable \u2014 everything else should stay the same.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n75Enzyme-Controlled ReactionsYou Need to be Able to Interpret Graphs of Enzyme-Controlled ReactionsThe results of enzyme-controlled reactions are usually shown in line graphs. You might be asked to interpret the graph of an enzyme-controlled reaction in the exam. The graph below shows the release of a product over time:Volume of product released by an enzyme-controlled reaction at different temperatures\u201c 50 '\u00a9 First look at the start of the graph and compare the rates of reaction here. E.g. the rate of reaction is fastest at 65 \u00b0C. Use what you know about factors affecting enzyme activity to explain why (see p. 12). You might have to work out the initial rate of reaction (see below).i i(T) Nov\/ look at what else the graphs are showing you and make comparisons between the different temperatures. At 37 \u00b0C the graph has plateaued (flattened out) because all the substrate has been used up.At 65 \u00b0C the graph has plateaued earlier than at 37 \u00b0C, because the high temperature caused the enzyme to denature, so the reaction stopped sooner. Not as much product was made because not all the substrate was converted to product before the enzyme was denatured, so there is still substrate left.At 25 \u00b0C the rate of reaction is remaining constant and the volume of product is continuing to increase because not all of the substrate has been used up.You Can Use a Tangent to Calculate the Initial Rate of ReactionThe initial rate of reaction is the rate of reaction right at the start of the reaction, close to time equals zero (t = 0) on the graph. To work out the initial rate of reaction carry out the following steps:Volume of product released by an enzyme-controlled reaction at 37 \u00b0C\n20 30 40Time (s)Practice Question1) Draw a tangent to the curve at t = 0, using a ruler. Do this by positioning the ruler so it's an equal distance from the curve at both sides of where it's touching it. Here you'll have to estimate where the curve would continue if it carried on below zero. Then draw a line along the ruler. (For more on drawing tangents see p. 212.)2) Then calculate the gradient of the tangent \u2014 this is the initialrate of reaction.

It can be interpreted, just like any other code, which is exactly what you might have to do in your exam...The Genetic Code is Non-Overlapping, Degenerate and Universal1) The genetic code is the sequence of base triplets (codons) in mRNA which code for specific amino acids.2) In the genetic code, each base triplet is read in sequence, separate from the triplet before it and after it. Base triplets don't share their bases \u2014 the code is non-overlapping.Order of bases on mRNABase triplet (codon)Code read in sequencemRNA base tripletAminoacidOrder of amino acids in a proteinUCA = ( serine )3) The genetic code is also degenerate \u2014 there are more possible combinations of triplets than there are amino acids (20 amino acids but 64 possible triplets). This means that some amino acids are coded for by more than one base triplet, e.g. tyrosine can be coded for by UAU or UAC.4) Some triplets are used to tell the cell when to start and stop production of the protein \u2014 these are called start and stop signals (or codons). They're found at the beginning and end of the mRNA. E.g. UAG is a stop signal.5) The genetic code is also universal \u2014 the same specific base triplets code for the same amino acids in all living things. E.g. UAU codes for tyrosine in all organisms.You need to be able to Interpret Data about Nucleic AcidsThe table on the right shows the mRNA codons (triplets) for some amino acids.

Here's an example (you don't need to learn it):Investigating the effect of new drugs on nucleic acids1)2)3)4)5)6)7)To investigate how two new drugs affect nucleic acids and their role in protein synthesis, bacteria were grown in normal conditions for a few generations, then moved to media containing the drugs.After a short period of time, the concentration of protein and Bar rhart show mRNA and protein concentrationin the presence and absence of drugscomplete strands of mRNA in the bacteria were analysed The results are shown in the bar graph.Both mRNA and protein concentration were lower in the presence of drug 1 compared to the no-drug control. This suggests that drug 1 affects the production of full length mRNA, so there's no mRNA for protein synthesis during translation.mRNA production in the presence of drug 2 was unaffected, but less protein was produced \u2014 3 mg cm-3 compared to 8 mg cm\"3.This suggests that drug 2 interferes with translation. mRNA was produced, but less protein was translated from it.Further tests to establish the nature of the two drugs were carried out.Drug 1 was found to be a ribonuclease (an enzyme that digests RNA). This could explain the results of the first experiment \u2014 any strands of mRNA produced by the cell would be digested by drug 1, so couldn't be used in translation to make proteins.Drug 2 was found to be a single-stranded, clover-shaped molecule capable of binding to the ribosome.

They're different because mitosis only involves one division (which separates the sister chromatids) whereas meiosis has two divisions (which separate the homologous pairs and then the sister chromatids). There's no pairing or separating of homologous chromosomes in mitosis, and so no crossing over or independent segregation of chromosomes.

The chromatids still contain the same genes but now have a different combination of alleles.Chromatids of one chromosomeCrossing over occurs between chromatidsChromatids now have a new combination of allelesMeiosis Produces Cells that are Genetically DifferentThere are two main events during meiosis that lead to genetic variation:(l^Crossing over of chromatidsThe crossing over of chromatids in meiosis I means that each of the four daughter cells formed from meiosis contains chromatids with different alleles:The chromosomes of homologous pairs come together.MEIOSIS IChromatids cross over.\nMEIOSISOne chromosome from each homologous pair ends up in each cell.Each cell has a different chromatid and therefore a different set of alleles, which increases genetic variation.(2) Independent segregation of chromosomer1) Each homologous pair of chromosomes in your cells is made up of one chromosome from your mum (maternal) and one chromosome from your dad (paternal).2) When the homologous pairs are separated in meiosis I, it's completely random which chromosome from each pair ends up in which daughter cell.3) So the four daughter cells produced by meiosis have completely different combinations of those maternal and paternal chromosomes.4) This is called independent segregation (separation) of the chromosomes.5) This 'shuffling' of chromosomes leads to genetic variation in any potential offspring.MEIOSISPaternalMaternalORPossible combinations in daughter cellsMeiosis Has a Different Outcome to MitosisYou may remember mitosis from page 32. Mitosis and meiosis have different outcomes:Outcomes:MitosisProduces cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell.Daughter cells are genetically identical to each other and to the parent cell.Produces two daughter cells.MeiosisProduces cells with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.Daughter cells are genetically different from one another and the parent cell.Produces four daughter cells.You need to be able to explain the different outcomes of mitosis and meiosis. They're different because mitosis only involves one division (which separates the sister chromatids) whereas meiosis has two divisions (which separate the homologous pairs and then the sister chromatids). There's no pairing or separating of homologous chromosomes in mitosis, and so no crossing over or independent segregation of chromosomes. This produces genetically identical daughter cells \u2014 unlike meiosis.Topic 4B \u2014 Diversity, Classification and Variation\n90Meiosis and Genetic VariationChromosome Mutations are Caused by Errors in Cell Division1) In humans, when meiosis works properly, all four daughter cells will end up with 23 whole chromosomes \u2014 one from each homologous pair (1 to 23).2) But sometimes meiosis goes wrong and the cells produced contain variations in the numbers of whole chromosomes or parts of chromosomes.3) For example, two cells might have 23 whole chromosomes, one each of 1 to 23, but the other two might get a bit muddled up, one having two chromosome 6's and the other no chromosome 6.4) This is called chromosome mutation and is caused by errors during meiosis.5) Chromosome mutations lead to inherited conditions because the errors are present in the gametes (the hereditary cells).One type of chromosome mutation is called non-disjunction \u2014 it's a failure of the chromosomes to separateproperly. In humans, non-disjunction of chromosome 21 during meiosis can lead to Down's Syndrome.Chromosome 211) Down's syndrome is caused by a person having an extra copy of chromosome 21 (or sometimes an extra copy of part of chromosome 21).2) Non-disjunction means that chromosome 21 fails to separate properly during meiosis, so one cell gets an extra copy of 21 and another gets none3) When the gamete with the extra copy fuses to another gamete at fertilisation, the resulting zygote will have three copies of chromosome 21.Non-disjunction occurs \u2014 homologous pair fails to separate.xVmu i M n- Non-disjunction t.\u2014 can also occur \u2014in meiosis II. \u2014\/1 ii r n ii' i1111sFertilisation \u20223 copies of chromosome 21ZygotePractice QuestionsQ1 Explain what is meant by the terms haploid and diploid.Q2 What happens to the chromosome number at fertilisation?Q3 What is a chromatid?Q4 Give three ways in which the outcome of meiosis differs from the outcome of mitosis.Exam QuestionsQ1 Drosophila (fruit flies) only have four chromosomes.The diagram on the right summarises meiosis in Drosophila.a) Complete the diagram to show the chromosomes in the four daughter cells.

Check. Brain switched on. Check. Cuppa piping hot. Check. Sweets on standby. Check. Okay, I think you're all sorted to start photosynthesis. Finally, take a deep breath and here we go...Photosynthesis Takes Place in the Chloroplasts of Plant Cells1) Chloroplasts are flattened organelles surrounded by a double membrane. They are found in plant cells.2) Thylakoids (fluid-filled sacs) are stacked up in the chloroplast into structures called grana (singular = granum).The grana are linked together by bits of thylakoid membrane called lamellae (singular = lamella).4) Chloroplasts contain photosynthetic pigments (e.g. chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotene). These are coloured substances that absorb the light energy needed for photosynthesis. The pigments are found in the thylakoid membranes \u2014 they're attached to proteins. The protein and pigment is called a photosystem.5) There are two photosystems used by plants to capture light energy.Photosystem I (or PSI) absorbs light best at a wavelength of 700 nm and photosystem II (PSII) absorbs light best at 680 nm.6) Contained within the inner membrane of the chloroplast and surrounding the thylakoids is a gel-like substance called the stroma. It contains enzymes, sugars and organic acids.7) Carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis and not used straight away are stored as starch grains in the stroma.outer memb'aneinner membrane stromathylakoid thylakoidmembrane lamellagranum(thylakoidcf arHPhotosynthesis can be Split into Two StagesThere are actually two stages that make up photosynthesis:crsmmammmm________cn- See p.' 108 for \\oad% more* * ' \u20141) As the name suggests, this reaction needs light energy.2) It takes place in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts.3) Here, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll (and other photosynthetic pigments) in the photosystems. The light energy excites the electrons in the chlorophyll, leading to their eventual release from the molecule.The chlorophyll has been photoionised.4) Some of the energy from the released electrons is used to add a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP, and some is used to reduce NADP to form reduced NADP. ATP transfers energy and reduced NADP transfers hydrogen to the light-independent reaction.5) During the process H^O is oxidised to 02.The Light-Independent Reaction1) This is also called the Calvin cycle and as the name suggests it doesn't use light energy directly. (But it does rely on the products of the light-dependent reaction.)2) It takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast.3) Here, the ATP and reduced NADP from the light-dependent reaction supply the energy and hydrogen to make simple sugars from CO,.\nIn the Light-Dependent Reaction ATP is Made by PhotophosphorylationIn the light-dependent reaction, the energy resulting from the photoionisation of chlorophyll is used for three things:1) Making ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. This reaction is called photophosphorylation (see p. 105).2) Making reduced NADP from NADP.3) Splitting water into protons (H+ ions), electrons and oxygen. This is called photolysis (see p. 105).The light-dependent reaction actually includes two types of photophosphorylation \u2014 non-cyclic and cyclic.Each of these processes has different products (see next page).Topic 5A \u2014 Photosynthesis and RespirationThis diagram shows how the two reactions link together in the chloroplast.thylakoid membrane Q.< c 0 ,e\n107PhotosynthesisNon-cyclic Photophosphorylation Produces ATP, Reduced NADP and O,To understand the process you need to know that the photosystems (in the thylakoid membranes) are linked by electron carriers. Electron carriers are proteins that transfer electrons. The photosystems and electron carriers form an electron transport chain \u2014 a chain of proteins through which excited electrons flow. All the processes in the diagrams are happening together \u2014 I've just split them up to make it easier to understand.1 ) Light energy excites electrons in chlorophyll jLight energy is absorbed by PSII.The light energy excites electrons in chlorophyll.The electrons move to a higher energy level (i.e. they have more energy).These high-energy electrons are released from the chlorophyll and move down the electron transport chain to PSI.LIGHT electron carrierthylakoidmembranetPSIiriiide the thylakoid1\/600 1s J*1, P7003^) Energy from the excited electrons makes ATP...)The excited electrons lose energy as they move down the electron transport chain.This energy is used to transport protons into the thylakoid. so that the thylakoid has a higher concentration of protons than the stroma.

Now you've enjoyed that poem, it's time to concentrate. I hope you like remembering reactions involved in respiration, because these pages have several.There are Two Types of Respiration1) The two types of respiration are aerobic (requires oxygen) and anaerobic (doesn't require oxygen).2) Both produce ATP (see p. 104), although anaerobic respiration produces less.3) Both start with the process of glycolysis (see below). The stages after glycolysis differ.Glycolysis Makes Pyruvate from Glucose1) Glycolysis involves splitting one molecule of glucose (with 6 carbons \u2014 6C) into two smaller molecules of pyruvate (3C).2) The process happens in the cytoplasm of cells.3) Glycolysis is the first stage of both aerobic and anaerobic respiration and doesn't need oxygen to take place \u2014 so it's an anaerobic process.There are Two Stages in Glycolysis Phosphorylation and OxidationFirst, ATP is used to phosphorylate glucose to triose phosphate. Overall there's a net gain of 2 ATP and 2 reduced NAD.Stage One \u2014 Phosphorylation]1) Glucose is phosphorylated using a phosphate from a molecule of ATP.This creates 1 molecule of glucose phosphate and 1 molecule of ADP.2) ATP is then used to add another phosphate, forming hexose bisphosphate.3) Hexose bisphosphate is then split into 2 molecules of triose phosphate.1) Triose phosphate is oxidised(loses hydrogen), forming 2 molecules of pyruvate.2) NAD collects the hydrogen ions, forming 2 reduced NAD.3) 4 ATP are produced, but 2 were used up in stage one, so there's a net gain of 2 ATP.ATPADPThen triose phosphate is oxidised, releasing ATP.glucoseDHnumber of carbons in the moleculeglucose phosphate |6C|ATPADPZ)Hhexose bisphosphate12 x triose phosphate4ATP2 NAD\n2 reduced NADIn aerobic respiration...1) The two molecules of reduced NAD go to oxidative phosphorylation \u2014 see page 116.2) The two pyruvate molecules are actively transported intothe matrix of the mitochondria for the link reaction (see the next page).In Anaerobic Respiration Pyruvate is Converted to Ethanol or LactateIn anaerobic respiration, the pyruvate produced in glycolysis is converted into ethanol (in plants and yeast) or lactate (in animal cells and some bacteria) using reduced NAD:Alcoholic Fermentation reducedCO.- NAD NADLactate Fermentation reduced NAD NADpyruvateethanalUethanolpyruvateylactate (lactic acid)The production of ethanol or lactate regenerates oxidised NAD.

Here's what happens next...The Link Reaction converts Pyruvate to Acetyl Coenzyme A1) Pyruvate is decarboxylated (one carbon atom is removed from pyruvate in the form of C02).2) Pyruvate is oxidised to form acetate and NAD is reduced to form reduced NAD.3) Acetate is combined with coenzyme A (CoA) to form acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA).4) No ATP is produced in this reaction.coenzyme A (CoA) \u201cpyruvate|3C|co?

(There arc some intermediate compounds formed during this conversion, but you don't need to know about them.)\u2022 Decarboxylation and dehydrogenation occur, producing one molecule of reduced FAD and two of reduced NAD.\u2022 ATP is produced by the direct transfer of a phosphate group from an intermediate compound to ADP. When a phosphate group is directly transferred from one molecule to another it's called substrate-level phosphorylation. Citrate has now been converted into oxaloacetate.Topic 5A \u2014 Photosynthesis and Respiration\n776Aerobic RespirationSome Products of the Krebs Cycle are Used in Oxidative PhosphorylationSome products are reused, some are released and others are used for the next stage of respiration:Productfrom one Krebs cycleWhere it goes1 coenzyme AReused in the next link reactionOxaloacetateRegenerated for use in the next Krebs cycle2 C02Released as a waste product1 ATPUsed for energy3 reduced NADTo oxidative phosphorylation1 reduced FADTo oxidative phosphorylationOxidative Phosphorylation Produces Lots of ATP1) Oxidative phosphorylation is the process where the energy carried by electrons, from reduced coenzymes (reduced NAD and reduced FAD), is used to make ATP.

This movement drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pj).6) This process of ATP production driven by the movement of H+ ions across a membrane (due to electrons moving down an electron transport chain) is called chemiosmosis (which is described by the chemiosmotic theory).7) In the mitochondrial matrix, at the end of the transport chain, the protons, electrons and 02 (from the blood) combine to form water.Oxygen is said to be the final electron acceptor.outer mitochondrial membrane intermembrane space inner mitochondrial membrane ---------------%---------------------High H\u2019 concentration H+ H+ H+ HH+ H+ H+\u2022P,H+Low H* concentrationATPATP synthaseTopic 5 A \u2014 Photosynthesis and Respiration\n777Aerobic Respiration32 ATP Can be Made from One Glucose MoleculeAs you know, oxidative phosphorylation makes ATP using energy from the reduced coenzymes\u2014 2.5 ATP are made from each reduced NAD and 1.5 ATP are made from each reduced FAD.The table on the right shows how much ATP a cell can make from one molecule of glucose in aerobic respiration.

They're much easier to explain if you describe their structure in four 'levels'. These levels are a protein's primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures.Primary Structure \u2014 this is the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain.Secondary Structure \u2014 the polypeptide chain doesn't remain flat and straight.Hydrogen bonds form between the amino acids in the chain.This makes it automatically coil into an alpha (a) helix or fold into a beta ((3) pleated sheet \u2014 this is the secondary structure.Tertiary Structure \u2014 the coiled or folded chain of amino acids is often coiled and folded further. More bonds form between different parts of the polypeptide chain, including hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds (attractions between negative and positive charges on different parts of the molecule).Disulfide bridges also form whenever two molecules of the amino acid cysteine come close together \u2014 the sulfur atom in one cysteine bonds to the sulfur atom in the other. For proteins made from a single polypeptide chain, the tertiary structure forms their final 3D structure.Quaternary Structure \u2014 some proteins are made of several different polypeptide chains held together by bonds. The quaternary structureis the way these polypeptide chains are assembled together. For proteins made from more than one polypeptide chain (e.g. haemoglobin, insulin, collagen), the quaternary structure is the protein's final 3D structure.amino acid\nTopic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","50":"136Topic 6B \u2014 Nervous CoordinationNeuronesAh, on to the good stuff.

This is because there are more positive ions outside the cell than inside.2) So the membrane is polarised \u2014 there's a difference in charge (called a potential difference or voltage) across it.3) The voltage across the membrane when it's at rest is called the resting potential \u2014 it's about-70 mV (millivolts).4) The resting potential is created and maintained by sodium-potassium pumpsand potassium ion channels in a neurone's membrane: \u0000 >\u2022 The sodium-potassium pumps move sodium ions out of the neurone, but the membrane isn't permeable to sodium ions, so they can't diffuse back in. This creates a sodium ion electrochemical gradient (a concentration gradient of ions) because there are more positive sodium ions outside the cell than inside.\u2022 The sodium-potassium pumps also move potassium ions in to the neurone, but the membrane is permeable to potassium ions so they diffuse back out through potassium ion channels.\u2022 This makes the outside of the cell positively charged compared to the inside.^ 111 n u 111 ii i it 1111111 n u 111111 ii i ii 11111111 it 1111111 n t- Z The sodium-potassium pump, potassium ion channel and sodium -- ion channel (see below) are all types of transport protein.

If the stimulus is big enough, it'l trigger a rapid change in potential difference.

This makes the inside of the neurone less negative.Depolarisation \u2014 if the potential difference reaches the threshold (around -55 mV), more sodium ion channels open. More sodium ions diffuse rapidly into the neurone.\u00ae Repolarisation \u2014 at a potential difference of around +30 mV the sodium ionchannels close and potassium ion channels open.

The potential difference becomes more negative than the resting potential (i.e. less than -70 mV).^ Resting potential \u2014 the ion channels are reset. The sodium-potassium pump returns the membrane to its resting potential and maintains it until the membrane's excited by another stimulus.After an action potential, the neurone cell membrane can't be excited again straight away. This is because the ion channels are recovering and they can't be made to open \u2014 sodium ion channels are closed during repolarisation and potassium ion channels are closed during hyperpolarisation. This period of recovery is called the refractory period.The Action Potential Moves Along the Neurone as a Wave of Depolarisation1) When an action potential happens, some of the sodium ions that enter the neurone diffuse sideways.2) This causes sodium ion channels in the next region of the neurone to open and sodium ions diffuse into that part.3) This causes a wave of depolarisation to travel along the neurone.4) The wave moves away from the parts of the membrane in the refractory period because these parts can't fire anaction potential.refractory refractoryperiodi It's like a Mexican wave _ = travelling through a - = crowd \u2014 sodium ions _ ' rushing inwards causes __ = a wave of activity alongstimulus -+ + +----------------Nt Nlthe membrane. rwave of depolarisationThe Refractory Period Produces Discrete Impulses1) During the refractory period, ion channels are recovering and can't be opened.2) So the refractory period acts as a time delay between one action potential and the next.This means that:\u2022 action potentials don't overlap, but pass along as discrete (separate) impulses.\u2022 there's a limit to the frequency at which the nerve impulses can be transmitted.\u2022 action potentials are unidirectional (they only travel in one direction).Action Potentials have an AII-or-Nothing Nature1) Once the threshold is reached, an action potentialwill always fire with the same change in voltage, cmaiutimnlnc AAAno matter how big the stimulus is. a2) If the threshold isn't reached, an action potential won't fire.

Sodium ion channels are concentrated at the nodes.5) In a myelinated neurone, depolarisation only happens at the nodes of Ranvier (where sodium ions can get through the membrane).6) The neurone's cytoplasm conducts enough electrical charge to depolarise the next node, so the impulse 'jumps' from node to node. >7) This is called saltatory conduction and it's really fast.8) In a non-myelinated neurone, the impulse travels as a wave along the whole length of the axon membrane (so you get depolarisation along the whole length of the membrane).9) This is slower than saltatory conduction (although it's still pretty quick).Structure of a myelinated motor neurone -cell bodymyelin sheath made up of a Schwann cellnode of Ranvierpk-nodes of RanvierKAAAAJ UUUUUUnerve impulse= Y\u00b0\" need to learn the -r structure of a myelinated 3 z rnotor neurone \"\"\"''\"\"itfininxf\u00a9Axon diameterAction potentials are conducted quicker along axons with bigger diameters because there's less resistance to the flow of ions than in the cytoplasm of a smaller axon. With less resistance, depolarisation reaches other parts of the neurone cell membrane quicker.(3) TemperatureThe speed of conduction increases as the temperature increases too, because ions diffuse faster.

Take your time and try scribbling it all down a few times till it starts to make some kind of sense. Neurones work because there's an electrical charge across their membrane, which is set up by ion pumps and ion channels. It's a change in this charge that transmits an action potential.Topic 6B \u2014 Nervous Coordination\n","51":"139Synaptic TransmissionWhen an action potential arrives at the end of a neurone, the information has to be passed on to the next cell\u2014 this could be another neurone, a muscle cell or a gland cell.A Synapse is a Junction Between a Neurone and the Next Cell1) A synapse is the junction between a neurone and another neurone, or between a neurone and an effector cell, e.g. a muscle or gland cell.2) The tiny gap between the cells at a synapse is called the synaptic cleft.3) The presynaptic neurone (the one before the synapse) has a swelling called a synaptic knob. This contains synaptic vesicles filled with chemicals called neurotransmitters.4) When an action potential reaches the end of a neurone it causes neurotransmitters to be released into the synaptic cleft.They diffuse across to the postsynaptic membrane (the one after the synapse) and bind to specific receptors.5) When neurotransmitters bind to receptors they might trigger an action potential (in a neurone), cause muscle contraction(in a muscle cell), or cause a hormone to be secreted (from a gland cell).6) Because the receptors are only on the postsynaptic membranes, synapses make sure impulses are unidirectional \u2014 the impulse can only travel in one direction.7) Neurotransmitters are removed from the cleft so the response doesn't keep happening, e.g. they're taken backinto the presynaptic neurone or they're broken down by enzymes (and the products are taken into the neurone).8) There are many different neurotransmitters, e.g. acetylcholine (ACh) and noradrenaline. Synapses that use acetylcholine are called cholinergic synapses. Their structure is exactly the same as in the diagram above.Typical structure of a synapsepostsynaptic presynaptic ,- _ ff membranemembranesynapticknobvesiclefilled with synaptic receptorsneu-otransmitters cleft\nACh Transmits the Nerve Impulse Across a Cholinergic SynapseThis is how a nerve impulse is transmitted across a cholinergic synapse: 1)2)3)An action potential (see pages 136-137) arrives at the synaptic knob of the presynaptic neurone.The action potential stimulates voltage-gated calcium ion channels in the presynaptic neurone to open.Calcium ions diffuse into the synaptic knob.(They're pumped out afterwards by active transport.)vesicle containing AChCa2111 m i ii 11 n i n . m hi 'i\" Voltage-gated ion channels - - open at a certain voltage, r , I I I II 1 I I \\ l l I 1 l1 ' \" 1 \" 1vesicles fuse with the membrane and release ACharrival of action \u2014 potentialCa2AChreceptorsCa diffuses into the synaptic knobThe influx of calcium ions into the synaptic knob causes the synaptic vesicles to move to the presynaptic membrane. They then fuse with the presynaptic membrane.The vesicles release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) into the synaptic cleft\u2014 this is called exocytosis.6) ACh diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to specific cholinergic receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.7) This causes sodium ion channels in the postsynaptic neurone to open.8) The influx of sodium ions into the postsynaptic membrane causes depolarisation. An action potential on the postsynaptic membrane is generated if the threshold is reached.9) ACh is removed from the synaptic cleft so the response doesn't keep happening. It's broken down by an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the products are re-absorbed by the presynaptic neurone and used to make more ACh.ACh diffuses across and:ptors .> *\u20197S, #new action\u2014\u0000 potential) i* ais generatedAChE breaks down ACh and the products are re-absorbedTopic 6B \u2014 Nervous Coordination\n140Synaptic TransmissionNeurotransmitters Can be Excitatory, Inhibitory or Both1) Excitatory neurotransmitters depolarise the postsynaptic membrane, making it fire an action potential if the threshold is reached. E.g. acetylcholine is an excitatory neurotransmitter at cholinergic synapses in the CNS \u2014 it binds to cholinergic receptors to cause an action potential in the postsynaptic membrane \u2014 and at neuromuscular junctions (see below).2) Inhibitory neurotransmitters hyperpolarise the postsynaptic membrane (make the potential difference more negative), preventing it from firing an action potential. E.g. acetylcholine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter at cholinergic synapses in the heart. When it binds to receptors here, it can cause potassium ion channels to open on the postsynaptic membrane, hyperpolarising it.Summation at Synapses Finely Tunes the Nervous ResponseIf a stimulus is weak, only a small amount of neurotransmitter will be released from a neurone into the synaptic cleft. This might not be enough to excite the postsynaptic membrane to the threshold level and stimulate an action potential. Summation is where the effect of neurotransmitter released from many neurones (or one neurone that's stimulated a lot in a short period of time) is added together. There are two types of summation:Spatial summation1)2)3)Temporal summation_ + + + +Temporal summation is where two or more nerve impulses arrive in quick 4succession from the same presynaptic neurone. This makes an action potential u\u0000 r , \u0000 ,.................. r 7 r .

These clefts store the enzyme that breaks down ACh (acetylcholinesterase \u2014 AChE).\u2022 The postsynaptic membrane has more receptors than other synapses. ^imiiiiiiiiiiiiumiiii^. . - You need to be able to ^\u2022 ACh is always excitatory at a neuromuscular junction.

You might have to predict the effects that a drug would have at a synapse in your exam. Here are some examples of how drugs can affect synaptic transmission:\u00a9Some drugs are the same shape as neurotransmitters so they mimic their action at receptors (these drugs are called agonists).This means more receptors are activated.

This results in the muscle being paralysed.ACh \/Ino action potential\u00a9Some drugs inhibit the enzyme that breaks down neurotransmitters (they stop it from working).

When gametes from two parents fuse together, the alleles they contain form the genotype of the offspring produced. At each locus, the genotype can be homozygous or heterozygous.Genetic diagrams can be used to predict the genotypes and phenotypes of the offspring produced if two parents are crossed (bred).

But don't despair \u2014 once you've learnt what the words mean and know how genetic diagrams work it'll ail just fall into place.Topic 7A \u2014 Genetics\n","53":"759Linkage and EpistasisRight, this stuff is fairly hard, so if you don't get it first time don't panic just work through it again until you do...Some Characteristics are Sex-linked1) The genetic information for gender is carried on two sex chromosomes.2) In mammals, females have two X chromosomes (XX) and males have one X and one V chromosome (XY).3) A characteristic is said to be sex-linked when the allele that codes for it is located on a sex chromosome.4) The Y chromosome is smaller than the X chromosome and carries fewer genes.So most genes on the sex chromosomes are only carried on the X chromosome (called X-linked genes).5) As males only have one X chromosome, they often only have one allele for sex-linked genes.So because they only have one copy, they express the characteristic of this allele even if it's recessive.This makes males more likely than females to show recessive phenotypes for genes that are sex-linked.6) Genetic disorders caused by faulty alleles on sex chromosomes include colour blindness and haemophilia.The faulty alleles for both of these disorders are carried on the X chromosome \u2014 they're called X-linked disorders.Example1) Colour blindness is a sex-linked disorder caused by a faulty allele carried on the X chromosome.2) As it's sex-linked both the chromosome and the allele are represented in the genetic diagram, e.g. Xn, where X represents the X chromosome and n the faulty allele for colour vision.3) The Y chromosome doesn't have an allele for colour vision so is just represented by Y.4) Females would need two copies of the recessive allele to be colour blind, while males only need one copy. This means colour blindness is much rarer in women than men.Parents'genotypesGametes'allelesPossible genotypes of offspringCarrier femaleUnaffected maleXN XnXN Y(g)XN XNX\"Y X\"XNXn YUnaffectedUnaffected Carrier Colour-blindfemalemalefemalemaleN \u2014 normal colour vision allele n \u2014 faulty colour vision allele7) In the example above, there's a 3 : 1 ratio of offspring without colour blindness : offspring with colour\u0000blindness. But when a female carrier and a male without colour-blindness have children (as in this example), only their male offspring are at risk of being colour-blind. So you can also say that there's a predicted 2:1:1 ratio \u2014 of female offspring without colour-blindness : male offspring without colour-blindness : male offspring with colour-blindness.8) This ratio will change if a female carrier (XNXn) and a male with colour-blindness (XnY) have children.The predicted ratio will then be 1 : 1 \u2014 of offspring with colour-blindness : offspring without colour-blindness. The ratio will be the same for offspring of each gender. You only end up with this predicted ratio for a monohybrid F, cross with a sex-linked characteristic.Some Autosomal Genes are LinkedD2)Autosome is the fancy name for any chromosome that isn't a sex chromosome.Autosomal genes are the genes located on the autosomes.Genes on the same autosome are said to be linked \u2014 because they're on the same autosome they'll stay together during the independent segregation of chromosomes in meiosis I, and their alleles will be passed on to the offspring together. The only reason this won't happen is if crossing over splits them up first3) The closer together two genes are on the autosome,the more closely they are said to be linked. This is because Genes A, B crossing over is less likely to split them up. T ^4) If two genes are autosomally linked, you won't get the ~ phenotypic ratio you expect in the offspring of a cross.5) For example, in a dihybrid cross between two heterozygous parents you'd expect a 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 ratio in the offspring (see previous page). Instead, the phenotypic ratio is more likely to be that expected for a monohybrid cross between two heterozygous parents (3:1) because the two autosomally-linked alleles are inherited together. This means that a higher proportion of the offspring will have their parents' (heterozygous) genotype and phenotype.6) This allows you to use the predicted phenotypic ratio to identify autosomal linkage.Topic 7A \u2014 Geneticsand C are all linked.Crossing over is when two homologous (paired) chromosomes swap bits'. It happens in meiosis I before independent segregation. You'll have learnt about this in Year 1 of your course.An autosomeGenes A and B are more closely linked than genes A and C.\n760Linkage and EpistasisGenetic Cross Results Can Show Autosomal LinkageIn the exam you might get some genetic cross results that show linkage and have to explain them.ExampleA scientist was investigating linkage between the genes for eye colour and wing length in fruit flies.The gene for normal wings (N) is dominant to the gene for vestigial wings (n) and the gene for red eyes (R) is dominant to the gene for purple eyes (r). The first cross the scientist carried out was between flies homozygous dominant for both normal wings and red eyes (NNRR) and flies homozygous recessive for both vestigial wings and purple eyes (nnrr). The resulting offspring were all heterozygous for normal wings and red eyes (NnRr).The second cross the scientist carried out was between these offspring (NnRr) and the flies homozygous recessive for vestigial wings and purple eyes (nnrr).He expected a 1 : I : 1 :1 ratio as shown below:i n 111 m n 11111 m i m \/\/, _ This is known as a back -Parents'allelesNnRrGametes'Tcross (crossing the offspring - with one of the parents). ~\"'I I 1 I I M M II I I I I I 11 III I I \"NHowever, the results he got forail*les V\/Kjy'C\/Vy \\ \u00a9 \u00a9 \u00ae \u00a9this cross show a 8 : 1 : 1 : 8 ratio as in the table:Number of offspringNnRrNnRrNnRrNnRrNormal wings, red eyes = 4Normal wings, red eyes (NlnRr)1216\u00a9NnrrNnrrNnrrNnrrNormal wings, purple eyes = 4Normal wings, purple eyes (Nnrr)152nnRrnnRrnnRrnnRrVestigial wings, red eyes = 4Vestigial wings, red eyes (nnRr)148\u00a9nnrrnnrrnnrrnnrrVestigial wings, purple eyes = 4Vestigial wings, purple eyes (nnrr)1184Phenotypic ratio = 1 :1 :1 :1Phenotypic rato = 8 : 1 : 1 : 8In order for the NnRr and nnrr genotypes to be so common in the offspring, the NR alleles and the nr alleles in the NnRr parent must have been linked. This means that the NnRr parent produced mostly NR and nr gametes. Some Nr and nR gametes were still made due to crossing over, but there were fewer Nnrr and nnRr offspring overall. As a result, a higher proportion of the offspring have their parents' phenotypes.An Epistatic Gene Masks the Expression of Another Gene1) Many different genes can control the same characteristic \u2014 they interact to form the phenotype.2) This can be because the allele of one gene masks (blocks) the expression of the alleles of other genes\u2014 this is called epistasis.Example 1In humans a widow's peak (see picture) is controlled by one gene and baldness by others. If you have the alleles that code for baldness, it doesn't matter whether you have the allele for a widow's peak or not, as you have no hair. The baldness genes are epistatic to the widow's peak gene, as the baldness genes mask the expression of the widow's peak gene.Example 2Flower pigment in a plant is controlled by two genes. Gene 1 codes for a yellow pigment (Y is the dominant yellow allele) and gene 2 codes for an enzyme that turns the yellow pigment orange (R is the dominant orange allele). If you don't have the Y allele it won't matter if you have the R allele or not as the flower will be colourless. Gene 1 is epistatic to gene 2 as it can mask the expression of gene 2.gene 2 (RR or Rr) \u0000geneColourlessI |YellowOrangemolecule.^pigmentpigment3) Crosses involving epistatic genes don't result in the expected phenotypic ratios given above, e.g. if you cross two heterozygous orange flowered plants (YyRr) from the above example you wouldn't get the expected 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 phenotypic ratio for a normal dihybrid cross.Topic 7A \u2014 Genetics\n767Linkage and EpistasisYou can Predict the Phenotypic Ratios for Some Epistatic GenesJust as you can predict the phenotypic ratios for a normal dihybrid cross (see page 158), you can predict the phenotypic ratios for dihybrid crosses involving some epistatic genes too:A dihybrid cross involving a recessive epistatic allele \u2014 9Having two copies of the recessive epistatic allele masks (blocks) the expression of the other gene. If you cross a homozygous recessive parent with a homozygous dominant parent you will get a 9 : 3 : 4 phenotypic ratio of dominant both : dominant epistatic recessive other: recessive epistatic in the F2 generation.r_______E.g. the flower example from the previous page isF, crossYYRR x yyrr = all YyRrYyRrOrange = YYRR, YYRr,F: crossYyRrYRYr\u00ae \u00a9 \u00ae \u00ae YyRR,YyRr = 9Yellow= Yyrr, YYrr = 3 White = yyRR, yyRr, yyrr = 4 Phenotypic ratio: 9:3:4YYRRYYRrYyRRYyRrYYRrYYr rYyRrYyr rYyRRYyRr yyRR yyRrYyRrYyr ryyR ryyrran example of a recessive epistatic allele. If a plant is homozygous recessive for the epistatic gene (yy) then it will be colourless, masking the expression of the orange gene. So if you cross homozygous parents, you should get a 9 : 3 : 4 ratio of orange : yellow : white in the F2 generation. You can check the phenotypic ratio is right using a genetic diagram:A dihybrid cross involving a dominant epistatic allele \u2014 12:3:1Having at least one copy of the dominant epistatic allele masks (blocks) the expression of the other gene. Crossing a homozygous recessive parent with a homozygous dominant parent will produce a 12 : 3 : 1 phenotypic ratio of dominant epistatic : recessive epistatic dominant other: recessive both in the F3 generation.E.g. squash colour is controlled by two genes \u2014 the colour \u00a3 crossepistatic gene (W\/w) and the yellow gene (Y\/y). The no-colour, white allele (W) is dominant over the coloured allele (w), so WW or Ww will be white and ww will be coloured. The yellow gene has the dominant yellow allele (Y) and the recessive green allele (y). So if the plant has at least one W, then the squash will be white, masking the expression of the yellow gene. So if you cross wwyy with WWYY, you'll get a 12 : 3 : 1 ratio of white : yellow : green in the F2 generation. Here's a genetic diagram to prove it:WWYY x wwyy = all WwYywwYy\u00a9 @> @) @Ww Y y\u00a9WWY Y WWY yWw Y YWw Y y(w y)WWY y WWy y Ww Y y Ww y yU (wy)Ww Y Y Ww Y ywwYY wwYy<SS)Ww Y y Ww y y w w Y ywwy yWhite = WWYY, WWYy, WWyy, WwYY, WwYy, Wwyy = 12 Yellow = wwYY, wwYy \u00bb 3 Green = wwyy = 1 Phenotypic ratio: 12:3:1Practice QuestionsQ1 What is a sex-linked characteristic?Q2 Two genes are autosomally-linked.

These molecules are needed to build proteins, which are required for the cells in living organisms to function. They're right handy little things.DNA and RNA Carry Important InformationDNA and RNA are both types of nucleic acid. They're found in all living cells and they both carry information.1) DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is used to store genetic information \u2014 that's all the instructions an organism needs to grow and develop from a fertilised egg to a fully grown adult.2) RNA (ribonucleic acid) is similar in structure to DNA. One of its main functions is to transfer genetic information from the DNA to the ribosomes. Ribosomes are the body's 'protein factories' \u2014 they read the RNA to make polypeptides (proteins) in a process called translation (see p. 85). Ribosomes themselves are made from RNA and proteins.DNA and RNA are Polymers of Nucleotides1) A nucleotide is a type of biological molecule. It's made from:Nucleotidenitrogen-containing\u2022 a pentose sugar (that's a sugar with 5 carbon atoms),\u2022 a nitrogen-containing organic base, ^\u201e,,,, n M ^\u2022 a phosphate group. r Organic' means that =----------------------------------------------------------------~ it contains carbon. \"\"711111 n W 1111111, | |C2) Nucleotides are really important. For a start, they're the monomers (see p. 2) that make up DNA and RNA.The Sugar in DNA is Called Deoxyribose1) The pentose sugar in a DNA nucleotide DNA nucleotideis called deoxyribose.2) Each DNA nucleotide has the same sugar and a phosphate group. The base on each nucleotide can vary though.3) There are four possible bases \u2014 adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C) and guanine (G).The Sugar in RNA is Called Ribose1) RNA contains nucleotides with a ribose sugar (not deoxyribose).2) Like DNA, an RNA nucleotide also has a phosphate group and one of four different bases.3) In RNA though, uracil (U) replaces thymine as a base.RNA nucleotide\nMary didn't care if it was ribose or deoxyribose, she just wanted her cuppa.Topic 7 B \u2014 More Biological Molecules\n77DNA and RNANucleotides Join Together to Form Polynucleotides1) A polynucleotide is a polymer of nucleotides.Both DNA and RNA nucleotides form polynucleotides.2) The nucleotides join up via a condensation reaction (see p. 2) between the phosphate group of one nucleotide and the sugar of another.3) This forms a phosphodiester bond (consisting of the phosphate group and two ester bonds).4) The chain of sugars and phosphates is known as the sugar-phosphate backbone.Part of a single polynucleotide strandPhosphodiester bondEster bondSugar-phosphatebackboneDNA is Made of Two Polynucleotide Chains in a Double-Helix Structure1) Two DNA polynucleotide strands join together by _ . . ... .. i I. Two joined polynucleotide strandshydrogen bonding between the bases.2) Each base can only join with one particular partner \u2014 this is called complementary base pairing (or specific base pairing).3) Adenine always pairs with thymine (A -T) and cytosine always pairs with guanine (C - G). This means that there are always equal amounts of adenine and thymine in a DNA molecule and equal amounts of cytosine and guanine.4) Two hydrogen bonds form between A and T, and three hydrogen bonds form between C and G.5) Two antiparallel (running in opposite directions) polynucleotide strands twist to form the DNA double-helix.6) DNA was first observed in the 1800s, but lots of scientists at the time doubted that it could carry the genetic code because it has a relatively simple chemical composition. Some argued that genetic information must be carried by proteins \u2014 which are much more chemically varied.7) By 1953, experiments had shown that DNA was the carrier of the genetic code. This v\/as also the year in which the double-helix structure, which helps DNA to carry out its function, was determined by Watson and Crick.RNA is a Relatively Short Polynucleotide ChainRNA is made from a single polynucleotide chain (not a double one).

And here's why...Totipotent Stem Cells are Able to Mature into Any Type of Body Cell1) Multicellular organisms are made up from many different cell types that are specialised for their function, e.g. liver cells, muscle cells, white blood cells.2) All these specialised cell types originally came from stem cells.3) Stem cells are unspecialised cells that can develop into other types of cell.4) Stem cells divide to become new cells, which then become specialised.5) All multicellular organisms have some form of stem cell.6) Stem cells are found in the embryo (where they become all the specialised cells needed to form a fetus) and in some adult tissues (where they become specialised cells that need to be replaced, e.g. stem cells in the intestines constantly replace intestinal epithelial cells).7) Stem cells that can mature (develop) into any type of body cell in an organism,(including the cells that make up the placenta in mammals) are called totipotent cells.8) Totipotent stem cells are only present in mammals in the first few cell divisions of an embryo.9) After this point the embryonic stem cells become pluripotent. They can still specialise into any cell in the body, but lose the ability to become the cells that make up the placenta.10) The stem cells present in adult mammals are either:\u2022 Multipotent stem cells \u2014 These are able to differentiate into a few different types of cell. For example, both red and white blood cells can be formed from multipotent stem cells found in bone marrow.\u2022 Unipotent stem cells \u2014 These can only differentiate into one type of cell.For example, there's a type of unipotent stem cell that can only divide to produce epidermal skin cells, which make up the outer layer of your skin.Stem Cells Become Specialised Because Different Genes are ExpressedStem cells become specialised because during their development, they only transcribe and translate part of their DNA:1)2)3)4)5)6)Stem cells all contain the same genes \u2014 but during development, not all of them are transcribed and translated (expressed).\"Mill III,, ,, m\u201e(\/- Remember: transcription is 3 Z when DNA is copied into ^- mRNA.

These changes are difficult to reverse, so once a cell has specialised it stays specialised. oft^e 9irls expresseddifferent jeans.[Example: Red Blood Cells')1) Red blood cells are produced from a type of stem cell in the bone marrow. They contain lots of haemoglobin and have no nucleus (to make room for more haemoglobin).2) The stem cell produces a new cell in which the genes for haemoglobin production are expressed. Other genes, such as those involved in removing the nucleus, are expressed too. Many other genes are not expressed (switched off), resulting in a specialised red blood cell.Topic 8A \u2014 Mutations and Gene Expression\n187Stem CellsCardiomyocytes Can be Made from Unipotent Stem Cells1) Cardiomyocytes are heart muscle cells that make up a lot of the tissue in our hearts.In mature mammals, it's thought that they can't divide to replicate themselves.2) This meant that for ages, everyone thought that we weren't able to regenerate our own heart cells at all. This is a major problem if the heart becomes damaged, e.g. by a heart attack, or the cells became worn out through age. Recent research however, has suggested that our hearts dohave some regenerative capability.3) Some scientists now think that old or damaged cardiomyocytes can be replaced by new cardiomyocytes derived from a small supply of unipotent stem cells in the heart.4) Some researchers think that this process could be constantly occurring,but haven't yet agreed on how quickly it happens.\u2022 Some believe that it's a really slow process and that it's possible that somecardiomyocytes are never replaced throughout a person's entire lifetime.\u2022 Others think that it's occurring more quickly, so that everycardiomyocyte in the heart is replaced several times in a lifetime.Stem Cells Can be Used to Treat Human DisordersSince stem cells can divide into a range of specialised cell types, doctors and scientists think they could be used to replace cells damaged by illness or injury.Some Stem Cell Therapies Already Exist1) Some stem cell therapies already exist for some diseases affecting the blood and immune system.2) Bone marrow contains stem cells that can bccomc specialised to form any type of blood cell. Bone marrow transplants can be used to rcplace the faulty bone marrow in patients that produce abnormal blood cells. The stem cells in the transplanted bone marrow divide and specialise to produce healthy blood cells.3) This technique has been used successfully to treat leukaemia (a cancer of the blood or bone marrow) and lymphoma (a cancer of the lymphatic system).4) It has also been used to treat some genetic disorders, such as sickle-cell anaemia and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID):Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a genetic disorder that affects the immune system. People with SCID have a poorly functioning immune system as their white blood cells (made in the bone marrow from stem cells) are defective. This means they can't defend the body against infections by identifying and destroying microorganisms. So SCID sufferers are extremely susceptible to infections. Treatment with a bone marrow transplant replaces the faulty bone marrow with donor bone marrow that contains stem cells without the faulty genes that cause SCID. These then differentiate to produce functional white blood cells. These cells can identify and destroy invading pathogens, so the immune system functions properly.Stem Cells Could be Used to Treat Other DiseasesScientists are researching the use of stem cells as treatment for lots of conditions, including:\u2022 Spinal cord injuries \u2014 stem cells could be used to replace damaged nerve tissue. n n t,,,, f n \\\\i1'\u2022 Heart disease and damage caused by heart attacks \u2014 ~ These tr\u20acatmentsbwt -stem cells could be used to replace damaged heart tissue. \u201c aren't z\u2022 Bladder conditions \u2014 stem cells could be used to grow whole bladders, ^ ^^dimcal trials.

Stem cells could be used to grow organs for those people awaiting transplants.\u2022 They could improve the quality of life for many people \u2014 e.g. stem cells could be used to replace damaged cells in the eyes of people who are blind.Human Stem Cells Can Come from Adult Tissue or EmbryosTo use stem cells scientists have to get them from somewhere. There are three main potential sources of human stem cells:(5Adult Stem Cells1) These are obtained from the body tissues of an adult.For example, adult stem cells are found in bone marrow.2) They can be obtained in a relatively simple operation \u2014 with very little risk involved, but quite a lot of discomfort.3) Adult stem cells aren't as flexible as embryonic stem cells \u2014 they can only specialise into a limited range of cells, not all body cell types (they're multipotent).<\u00a3Embryonic Stem Cells1) These are obtained from embryos at an early stage of development.2) Embryos are created in a laboratory using in vitro fertilisation (IVF) \u2014 egg cells are fertilised by sperm outside the womb.3) Once the embryos are approximately 4 to 5 days old, stem cells are removed from them and the rest of the embryo is destroyed.4) Embryonic stem cells can divide an unlimited number of times and develop into all types of body cells (they're pluripotent).(2Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPS Cells)x\\l1 l M ' M I) | \/ | , | | |l, , , , (|- Inscription factors are - r proteins that control whether =- \u00b0r not genes are transcribed ~'\/a see Pa9e 190 for more Z \/n f'11 ii 11 \/ , \/111 M , M)Xs\"1) iPS cells are created by scientists in the lab. The process involves 'reprogramming' specialised adult body cells so that they become pluripotent.2) The adult cells are made to express a series of transcription factors that are normally associated with pluripotent stem cells. The transcription factors cause the adult body cells to express genes that are associated with pluripotency.3) One of the ways that these transcription factors can be introduced to the adult cells is by infecting them with a specially-modified virus. The virus has the genes coding for the transcription factors within its DNA. When the virus infects the adult cell, these genes are passed into the adult cell's DNA, meaning that the cell is able to produce the transcription factors.4) Induced pluripotent stem cells could become really useful in research and medicine in the future\u2014 see next page. At the moment though, more research into how similar they actually are to true pluripotent embryonic stem cells is needed before they can be properly utilised.Topic 8A \u2014 Mutations and Gene Expression\n7 89Stem CellsThere are Ethical Issues Surrounding Embryonic Stem Cell Use1) Obtaining stem cells from embryos created by IVF raises ethical issues because the procedure results in the destruction of an embryo that could become a fetus if placed in a womb.2) Some people believe that at the moment of fertilisation an individual is formed that has the right to life \u2014 so they believe that it's wrong to destroy embryos.3) Some people have fewer objections to stem cells being obtained from egg cells that haven't been fertilised by sperm, but have been artificially activated to start dividing. This is because the cells couldn't survive past a few days and wouldn't produce a fetus if placed in a womb.4) Some people think that scientists should only use adult stem cells because their production doesn't destroy an embryo. But adult stem cells can't develop into all the specialised cell types that embryonic stem cells can.5) This is where induced pluripotent stem cells could prove really useful. They have the potential to be as flexible as embryonic stem cells, but, as they're obtained from adult tissue, there aren't the same ethical issues surrounding their use. Good news all round.6) It's also possible that iPS cells could be made from a patient's own cells. These iPS cells, which would be genetically identical to the patient's cells, could then be used to grow some new tissue or an organ that the patient's body wouldn't reject (rejection of transplants occurs quite often and is caused by the patient's immune system recognising the tissue as foreign and attacking it).7) The decision makers in society have to take into account everyone's views when making decisions about important scientific work like stem cell research and its use to treat human disorders.m i n i n 111111 m i u w \/11111111111 n n n 111 n 1111111 n 111111111 \/111 n 111\/.- You might be asked to evaluate the use of stem cells in treating human disorders in r r the exams \u2014 so make sure you know all the pros and cons on pages 187 to 189. -\"n I I I i n I I I I I I I I 11 11 I I II i \/ \/ u l M I II II I I I II I I I I I M I I I I I I I I I I II I II I 11 \/ M I IIsPractice QuestionsQ1 At what stage of development can totipotent stem cells be found in mammals?Q2 Describe the difference between pluripotent and multipotent stem cells.Q3 How do stem cells become specialised?Q4 Name two conditions that stem cells could potentially be used to treat.Q5 Describe one difference between embryonic and adult stem cells.Exam QuestionQ1 Scientists are currently exploring the potential for the use of stem cells in medicine.a) Explain one way in which stem cell therapy is currently being used.

Mwah ha hah.Transformed Organisms Are Made Using Recombinant DNA Technology1) Microorganisms, plants and animals can all be transformed using recombinant DNA technology. This is called genetic engineering.2) Transformed microorganisms can be made using the same technology as in vivo cloning (see page 199). For example, foreign DNA can be inserted into microorganisms to produce lots of useful protein, e.g. insulin:jvM \/1 \" 1 I I \" , , , , , , , , I , 1 , # ( ! I I ,r lransf\u00b0rmed organisms are also - \u00a3 Known as genetically engineered or Z Z genet.cally modified (GM) organisms. = \" I I l ,, I , \/ , I I! ! ( I\\\n3)4)5)Transformed plants can also be produced. A gene that codes for a desirable protein is inserted into a plasmid. The plasmid is added to a bacterium and the bacterium is used as a vector to get the gene into the plant cells.If the right promoter region has been added along with the gene (see p. 199), the transformed cells will be able to produce the desired protein.Transformed animals can be produced too \u2014 a gene that codes for a desirable protein can be inserted into an early animal embryo or into the egg cells of a female. If the gene is inserted into a very early embryo, all the body cells of the resulting transformed animal will end up containing the gene. Inserting it into the egg cells means that when the female reproduces, all the cells of her offspring will contain the gene.Promoter regions that are only activated in specific cell types can be used to control exactly which of an animal's body cells the protein is produced in. If the protein is only produced in certain cells, it can be harvested more easily. Producing the protein in the wrong cells could also damage the organism.Recombinant DNA Technology Can be Used to Benefit HumansTransformed organisms (microorganisms, plants and animals) can be used in a variety of ways. You need to be able to interpret information about how they are used. Here are some examples:AgricultureAgricultural crops can be transformed so that they give higher yields or are more nutritious. This means these plants can be used to reduce the risk of famine and malnutrition. Crops can also be transformed to have pest resistance, so that fewer pesticides are needed. This reduces costs and reduces any environmental problems associated with using pesticides.For example, Golden Rice is a variety of transformed rice. It contains one gene from a maize plant and one gene from a soil bacterium, which together enable the rice to produce beta-carotene. The beta-carotene is used by our bodies to produce vitamin A. Golden Rice is being developed to reduce vitamin A deficiency in areas where there's a shortage of dietary vitamin A, e.g. south Asia, Africa. Vitamin A deficiency is a big problem in these areas, e.g. up to 500 000 children per year worldwide go blind due to vitamin A deficiency.IndustryIndustrial processes often use biological catalysts (enzymes). These enzymes can be produced from transformed organisms, so they can be produced in large quantities for less money, reducing costs.For example, chymosin (or rennin) is an enzyme used in cheese-making. It used to be made from rennet (a substance produced in the stomach of cows), but it can now be produced by transformed organisms. This means it can be made in large quantities, relatively cheaply and without killing any cows, making some cheese suitable for vegetarians.MedicineMany drugs and vaccines are produced by transformed organisms, using recombinant DNA technology. They can be made quickly, cheaply and in large quantities using this method.For example, insulin is used to treat Type 1 diabetes and used to come from animals (cow, horse or pig pancreases). This insulin wasn't human insulin though, so it didn't work quite as well. Human insulin is now made from transformed microorganisms, using a cloned human insulin gene (see above).Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n202Using Recombinant DNA TechnologyThere are Concerns About the Use of Recombinant DNA Technology...There are ethical, financial and social issues associated with the use of recombinant DNA technology:AgricultureFarmers might plant only one type of transformed crop (this is called monoculture). This could make the whole crop vulnerable to the same disease because the plants are genetically identical. Environmentalists are also concerned about monocultures reducing biodiversity, as this could damage the environment.Some people are concerned about the possibility of 'superweeds' \u2014 weeds that are resistant to herbicides. These could occur if transformed crops interbreed with wild plants. There could then be an uncontrolled spread of recombinant DNA, with unknown consequences.Organic farmers can have their crops contaminated by wind-blown seeds from nearby genetically modified crops. This means they can't sell their crop as organic and may lose their income.IndustryAnti-globalisation activists oppose globalisation (e.g. the growth of large multinational companies at the expense of smaller ones). A few, large biotechnology companies control some forms of genetic engineering. As the use of this technology increases, these companies get bigger and more powerful. This may force smaller companies out of business, e.g. by making it harder for them to compete. Without proper labelling, some people think they won't have a choice about whether to consume food made using genetically engineered organisms.Some consumer markets, such as the EU, won't import GM foods and products. This can cause an economic loss to producers who have traditionally sold to those markets.MedicineCompanies who own genetic engineering technologies may limit the use of technologies that could be saving lives.Some people worry this technology could be used unethically, e.g. to make designer babies (babies that have characteristics chosen by their parents). This is currently illegal though.Recombinant DNA technology also creates ownership issues. Here are some examples:\u2022 There is some debate about who owns genetic material from humans once it has been removed from the body \u2014 the donor or the researcher. Some people argue that the individual holds the right to their own genetic information, however others argue that value is created by the researcher who uses it to develop a medicine or in diagnosis.\u2022 A small number of large corporations own patents to particular seeds. They can charge high prices, sometimes including a 'technology fee', and can require farmers to repurchase seeds each year.If non-GM crops are contaminated by GM crops, farmers can be sued for breaching the patent law....But Humanitarians Think it will Benefit PeopleRecombinant DNA technology has many potential humanitarian benefits:1) Agricultural crops could be produced that help reduce the risk of famine and malnutrition, e.g. drought-resistant crops for drought-prone areas.2) Transformed crops could be used to produce useful pharmaceutical products (e.g. vaccines) which could make drugs available to more people, e.g. in areas where refrigeration (usually needed for storing vaccines) isn't available.3) Mcdicines could be produced more chcaply, so more people can afford them.4) Recombinant DNA technology has the potential to be used in gene therapy to treat human diseases (see next page).>0U need to be able z- to balance the humanitarian : r h\/neflts opposing views =- from environmentalists and ~ S ant|-9|obalisat,on activists r(see above) -Topic 8B \u2014 Genome Projects and Gene Technologies\n203Using Recombinant DNA TechnologyGene Therapy Could be Used to Treat or Cure Genetic Disorders and CancerRecombinant DNA technology could also be used to treat human diseases. This is known as gene therapy.Z ^ therapy isn't being \"'z1) Gene therapy involves altering the defective genes (mutated alleles) r used widely yet but there is a =inside cells to treat genetic disorders and cancer. r somatlc gene therapy r2) How you do this depends on whether the disorder is caused by a z are un^Jn otl'ler treatments zmutated dominant allele or two mutated recessive alleles (see page 156): \u2018 111 \/11 n\u00b0i u wT m nf?',\u2022 If it's caused by two mutated recessive alleles you can add a working dominant allele to make up for them (you 'supplement' the faulty ones).\u2022 If it's caused by a mutated dominant allele you can 'silence' the dominant allele (e.g. by sticking a bit of DNA in the middle of the allele so it doesn't work any more).Both of these processes involve inserting a DNA fragment into the person's original DNA.How you get the 'new' allele (DNA) inside the cell:1) The allele is inserted into cells using vectors (see page 199) just like in recombinant DNA technology.2) Different vectors can be used, e.g. altered viruses, plasmids or liposomes (spheres made of lipid).There are two types of gene therapy:1) Somatic therapy \u2014 this involves altering the alleles in body cells, particularly the cells that aremost affected by the disorder. For example, cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that's very damaging to the respiratory system, so somatic therapy for CF targets the epithelial cells lining the lungs. Somatic therapy doesn't affect the individual's sex cells (sperm or eggs) though, so any offspring could still inherit the disease.2) Germ line therapy \u2014 this involves altering the alleles in the sex cells. This means that every cell of any offspring produced from these cells will be affected by the gene therapy and they won't suffer from the disease. Germ line therapy in humans is currently illegal though.There are also many ethical issues associated with gene therapy. For example, some people are worried that the technology could be used in ways other than for medical treatment, such as for treating the cosmetic effects of aging. Other people worry that there's the potential to do more harm than good by using the technology (e.g. risk of overexpression of genes \u2014 gene produces too much of the missing protein).Practice QuestionsQ1 What are transformed organisms?Q2 Give one financial issue associated with the use of recombinant DNA technology in industry.Q3 What is gene therapy?Exam Questionof wheat plants.

E.g. an organism with a surface area to volume ratio of 2 : 1 would theoretically have a surface area twice as large as its volume.3) Ratios are usually most useful in their simplest (smallest) form. To simplify a ratio, divide each side by the same number. It's in its simplest form when there's nothing left you can divide by. To get a ratio of X : Y in the formX : 1, divide both sides by Y. E.g. to get 28 : 34 into the ratio of X : 1, divide both sides by 34. You get 0.82 : 1.You Need to be Able to Use Logarithms1) It's tricky to plot graphs with very small and very large numbers (e.g. both 0.1 and 1000) on the same axis.2) We can make it easier by converting values to their logarithms and plotting them on a logarithmic scale (e.g. a logl0 scale).3) On a log1() scale, each value is ten times larger than the value before. This means the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 on a log10 scale represent 10, 100, 1000 and 10 000 on a linear (normal) scale.-'y'\"\"\u2019,\"'.\"\" i\" \"mi in, it- i need to be able to read off a : ~ logarithmic scale on a q 71 M , M II II II I I I I H M , Ion a graph. - 11111 I if1log10 scale l linear scale r4) To calculate logarithms, you need to use the log button on your calculator.

To do this add together all the data values and divide by the total number of values in the sample.TesttubeMass (g)Mean (g) ^Range (g)Repeat 1Repeat 2Repeat 3A283732(28 + 37 + 32) -r 3 = 32.337-28 = 9B475160(47 + 51 + 60) -+ 3 = 52.760-47 = 13--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2) You might also need to calculate the range (how spread out the data is).^To do this find the largest data value and subtract the smallest data value from it.3) Standard deviation can be more useful than the range because it tells you how values are spread about the mean rather than just the total spread of data. A small standard deviation means the repeated results are all similar and close to the mean, i.e. they are precise.Like the mean, the median and mode are both types of average.\u2022 To calculate the median, put all your data in numerical order. The median is the middle value in this list.If you have an even number of values, the median is halfway between the middle two values.\u2022 To calculate the mode, count how many times each value comes up. The mode is the number thatappears most often. A set of data might not have a mode \u2014 or it might have more than one.Practical Skills\n277Processing and Presenting DataWatch Out For Significant Figures...D2)3)The first significant figure of a number is the first digit that isn't a zero. The second, third and fourthsignificant figures follow on immediately after the first (even if they're zeros).When you're processing your data you may well want to round any really long numbers to a certainnumber of significant figures. E.g. 0.6878976 rounds to 0.69 to 2 s.f..When you're doing calculations using measurements given to a certain number of significant figures, you should give your answer to the lowest number of significant figures that was used in the calculation.For example: ^Miiiiifniiiiiiiiiiinuuiii\/\/r When rounding a number, if the r 1.2 -r 1 .85 = 0.648648648... =0.65 E next digit after the last significant Z^ Round the last - figure you're using is less than five, - 2 s.f.-^3 s.f.

COn i j n ii n ii m i n ii 11111 m 11 This is because the fewer digits a measurement has, the less accurate it is.Your answer can only be as accurate as the least accurate measurement in the calculation...and Standard Form1) When you're processing data you might also want to change very big or very small numbers that have lots of zeros into something more manageable \u2014 this is called standard form.E.g. 1 000 000 can be written 1 x 10\u00b0 and 0.01 7 can be written 1.7x1 O'2.2) To do this you just need to move the decimal point left or right. The number of places the decimal point moves is then represented by a power of 10 \u2014 this is positive for big numbers, and negative for numbers smaller than one. For example:fVW\\A rabbit playing the piano. Definitely not standard form.16 5 00 = 1.65 x 104 The decimal point has moved four places to the left, so the power of 10 is +4. \/YYY^0.000362 = 3.62 x 10~4 The decimal point has moved four places to the right, so the power of 10 is -4.You Need to Understand How and When Statistical Tests are Used to Analyse Data1) The Student's t-test. You can use the Student's t-test when you have two sets of data that you want to compare. It tests whether there is a significant difference in the means of the two data sets. The value obtained is compared to a critical value, which helps you decide how likely it is that the results or 'differences in the means' were due to chance. If the value obtained from the t-test is greater than the critical value at a probability (P value) of 5% or less (< 0.05), then you can be 95% confident that the difference is significant and not due to chance. This is called a 95% confidence limit \u2014 which is good enough for most biologists to reject the null hypothesis. A null hypothesis is a special type of hypothesis used with statistical tests. It states that there's no significant difference between the things you're measuring.2) The Chi-squared test (see pages 162-163). You can use the Chi-squared test when you have categorical (grouped) data and you want to compare whether your observed results are statistically different from your expected results. You compare your result to a critical value \u2014 if it's larger than the critical value at P = 0.05, you can be 95% certain the difference is significant.3) A correlation coefficient, e.g. the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. This test allows you to work out the degree to which two sets of data are correlated (see page 213 for more on correlation).It is given as a value between 1 and -1. A value of 1 indicates a strong positive correlation, 0 means there is no correlation and -1 is a strong negative correlation. You can then compare your result toa critical value to find out whether or not the correlation is significant. \u0000. m u i u u n n i\/w u n i m 11 n i' i u i ^ (___________You can be more confident in your conclusions (see page 213), if they're based on results that have been analysed using a statistical test.; You need to be familiar with the symbols ,: < (less than), > (more than), \u00ab (much= less than) and \u00bb (much greater than . -^M|1|IMM>MIMIlUUlMlininMPractical Skills\n272Processing and Presenting DataUse a Suitable Graph or Chart to Present Your DataScatter graph:Graphs and charts are a great way of presenting data \u2014 they can make results much easier to interpret.1) When you have qualitative data (non-numerical data, e.g. blood group) or discrete data (numericaldata that can only take certain values in a range, e.g. shoe size) you can use bar charts or pie charts.2) When you have continuous data (data that can take any value in arange, e.g. height or weight) you can use histograms or line graphs.3) When you want to show how two variables are related(or correlated, see next page) you can use a scatter graph.Whatever type of graph you use, you should make sure that:\u2022 The dependent variable goes on the y-axis (the vertical axis) and the independent on the x-axis (the horizontal axis).\u2022 You always label the axes, include the quantity and units, and choose a sensible scale.\u2022 The graph covers at least half of the graph paper.If you need to draw a line (or curve) of best fit on a scatter graph,draw the line through or as near to as many points as possible,ignoring any anomalous results.line of fopstfit;<X'XalomaloiISresult\\-N<X-*\u2014i\u2014Average temperature (\u00b0C)Find the Rate By Finding the GradientRate is a measure of how much something is changing over time. Calculating a rate can be useful when analysing your data, e.g. you might want to the find the rate of a reaction. Rates are easy to work out from a graph:For a linear graph you can calculate the Change in Yrate by finding the gradient of the line: Gradient = (^|iange jn ^c -I r . *u- i 24 mmol dm-3 ^ ^ . .-5 So in this example: rate =----------------- = 2.4 mmol dm 3 min1e 10 minutesEThe equation of a straight line can always be written in the form y = mx + c, where m is the gradient and c is the y-intercept (this is the value of y when the line crosses the y-axis). In this example, the equation of the line is y = 2.4x + 0 (or just y = 2.4x). Knowing the equation of the line allows you to estimate results not plotted on the graph. E.g. in this case, when x (the time) is 20 min, y (the sodium ion concentration) will be 2.4x = 2.4 x 20 =5 10Time \/ minThe change in x is 10 min.For a curved (non-linear) graph you can find the rate by drawing a1) Position a ruler on the graph at the point where you want to know the rate.2) Angle the ruler so there is equal space between the ruler and the curve on either side of the point.3) Draw a line along the ruler to make the tangent.Extend the line right across the graph \u2014 it'll help to make your gradient calculation easier as you'll have more points to choose from.4) Calculate the gradient of the tangent to find the rate.Gradient = 55 m2 -f 4.4 years = 12.5 m2 year1When calculating a rate (or anything else for that matter) you might have to convert between units, e.g. seconds and minutes.

But what are proteins? What do they look like? Well, for your enjoyment, here are the answers to all those questions and many, many more...Proteins are Made from Long Chains of Amino Acids1) The monomers of proteins are amino acids.2) A dipeptide is formed when two amino acids join together.3) A polypeptide is formed when more than two amino acids join together.4) Proteins are made up of one or more polypeptides.Grant's cries of \"die peptide, die\" could be heard for miles around. He'd never forgiven it for sleeping with his wife.Different Amino Acids Have Different Variable GroupsAmino acids have the same general structure \u2014 a carboxyl group (-COOH), an amine or amino group (-NH2) and an R group (also known as a variable side group).Structure of an Amino AcidR ^\u2014variable groupIH,N \u2014 CCOOH\\groupcarboxylgroupAll living things share a bank of only 20 amino acids.The only difference between them is what makes up their R group.Polypeptides are Formed by Condensation ReactionsE.g.

They're much easier to explain if you describe their structure in four 'levels'. These levels are a protein's primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures.Primary Structure \u2014 this is the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain.Secondary Structure \u2014 the polypeptide chain doesn't remain flat and straight.Hydrogen bonds form between the amino acids in the chain.This makes it automatically coil into an alpha (a) helix or fold into a beta ((3) pleated sheet \u2014 this is the secondary structure.Tertiary Structure \u2014 the coiled or folded chain of amino acids is often coiled and folded further. More bonds form between different parts of the polypeptide chain, including hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds (attractions between negative and positive charges on different parts of the molecule).Disulfide bridges also form whenever two molecules of the amino acid cysteine come close together \u2014 the sulfur atom in one cysteine bonds to the sulfur atom in the other. For proteins made from a single polypeptide chain, the tertiary structure forms their final 3D structure.Quaternary Structure \u2014 some proteins are made of several different polypeptide chains held together by bonds. The quaternary structureis the way these polypeptide chains are assembled together. For proteins made from more than one polypeptide chain (e.g. haemoglobin, insulin, collagen), the quaternary structure is the protein's final 3D structure.amino acid\nTopic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n9ProteinsProteins have a Variety of FunctionsThere are loads of different proteins found in living organisms. They've all got different structures and shapes, which makes them specialised to carry out particular jobs. For example:1) Enzymes \u2014 they're usually roughly spherical in shape due to the tight folding of the polypeptide chains. They're soluble and often have roles in metabolism, e.g. some enzymes break down large food molecules (digestive enzymes, see pages 66-67) and other enzymes help to synthesise (make) large molecules.< ] j >2) Antibodies \u2014 are involved in the immune response. They're made up of two light (short)polypeptide chains and two heavy (long) polypeptide chains bonded together.

This means the substrate won't fit into the active site, an enzyme-substrate complex won't be formed and the enzyme will no longer be able to carry out its function.6) The tertiary structure of an enzyme may be altered by changes in pH or temperature (see next page).7) The primary structure (amino acid sequence) of a protein is determined by a gene. If a mutation occurs in that gene (see p. 91), it could change the tertiary structure of the enzyme produced.Practice QuestionsQ1 What is an enzyme?Q2 What is the name given to the amount of energy needed to start a reaction?Q3 What is an enzyme-substrate complex?Q4 Why can an enzyme only bind to one substance?[4 marks] [2 marks]Exam QuestionsQ1 Dcscribc the \u2018induced fit\u2019 model of enzyme action.Q2 Explain how a change in the amino acid sequence of an enzyme may prevent it from functioning properly.But why is the enzyme-substrate complex?So enzymes lower the activation energy of a reaction. I like to think of it as an assault course (bear with me). Suppose the assault course starts with a massive wall \u2014 enzymes are like the person who gives you a leg up over the wall (see?).

Humans need things like money and the newest mobile phone, but enzymes are quite content with the right temperature and pH.Temperature has a Big Influence on Enzyme ActivityLike any chemical reaction, the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction increases when the temperature's increased. More heat means more kinetic energy, so molecules move faster. This makes the enzymes more likely to collide with the substrate molecules. The energy of these collisions also increases, which means each collision is more likely to result in a reaction. But, if the temperature gets too high, the reaction stops.1) The rise in temperature makes the enzyme's molecules vibrate more.2) If the temperature goes above a certain level, this vibration breaks some of the bonds that hold the enzyme in shape.3) The active site changes shape and the enzyme and substrate no longer fit together.4) At this point, the enzyme is denatured\u2014 it no longer functions as a catalyst.optimum temperature11 nn 11,TemperaturepH Also Affects Enzyme ActivityO\u2019\" \" I M I | | | ,, , ,~ Every enzyme has an enzyme is r optimum temperature = denatured r For most human enzymes - r ,t,saro^37\u00b0C but some r _ enzymes, like those used in ~- biological washing powders, ~ ~ can work well at 60 \u00b0C ~All enzymes have an optimum pH value. Most human enzymes work best at pH 7 (neutral), but there are exceptions. Pepsin, for example, works best at acidic pH 2, which is useful because it's found in the stomach. Above and below the optimum pH, the H+ and OH ions found in acids and alkalis can mess up the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds that hold the enzyme's tertiary structure in place. This makes the active site change shape, so the enzyme is denatured.Enzyme Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction1) The more enzyme molecules there are in a solution,the more likely a substrate molecule is to collide with one and form an enzyme-substrate complex. So increasing the concentration of the enzyme increases the rate of reaction.2) But, if the amount of substrate is limited, there comes a point when there's more than enough enzyme molecules to deal with all the available substrate, so adding more enzyme has no further effect.steady increase as more active sites are available \\if substrate amount is limited, an increase in enzyme concentration eventually has no further effectEnzyme ConcentrationSubstrate Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction Up to a Pointsteady increase as more substrate molecules are availableall active sites used \u2014 increase in substrate concentration has no further effectSubstrate Concentration1) The higher the substrate concentration, the faster the reaction \u2014 more substrate molecules means a collision between substrate and enzyme is more likely and so more active sites will be used. This is only true up until a 'saturation' point though. After that, there are so many substrate molecules that the enzymes have about as much as they can cope with(all the active sites are full), and adding more makes no difference.2) Substrate concentration decreases with time during a reaction (unless more substrate is added to the reaction mixture), so if no other variables are changed, the rate of reaction will decrease over time too. This makes the initial rate of reaction (the reaction rate at the start) the highest rate of reaction.Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\n","62":"SPECIFICATION \nREFERENCE1 THE CHEMISTRY OF LIFE 1A\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n \u25fcUnder stand the importance of water as a solvent in transport, including its dipole nature.\nIONIC AND COVALENT BONDING\nBiology is the study of  living things \u2013 but living things consist of  chemical substances.

Without water, \nsubstances could not move around the body. Water is one of  the reactants in the process of  photosynthesis, on which almost all life depends (see fig E). Understanding the properties of  water will help you understand many key systems in living organisms. \nWater is also a major habitat \u2013 it supports more life than any other \npart of  the planet.\n\u25b2 fig E  W ater is vital for life on Earth in many different ways \u2013 in a desert, \nthe smallest amount of water allows plants to grow.\nThe simple chemical formula of  water is H2O. This tells us that \ntwo atoms of  hydrogen are joined to one atom of  oxygen to make \nup each water molecule. However, because the electrons are held closer to the oxygen atom than to the hydrogen atoms, water is a polar molecule (see fig F).\n104.5\u00b0O\u03b42\nH\u03b41H\u03b41\n\u25b2 fig F  A model of a w ater molecule showing dipoles.\nOne major effect of  this polarity is that water molecules form hydrogen  bonds. The slightly negative oxygen atom of  one water \nmolecule will attract the slightly positive hydrogen atoms of  other water molecules in a weak electrostatic attraction called a hydrogen \nbond. Each individual hydrogen bond is weak but there are many of  them so the molecules of  water \u2018stick together\u2019 more than you might expect (see fig G). Water has relatively high melting and boiling points compared with other substances that have molecules of  a similar size because it takes a lot of  energy to break all the hydrogen bonds that hold the molecules together. Hydrogen bonds are important in protein structure (see Sections 1A.5 and 2B.1) \nand in the structure and functioning of  DNA (see Section 2B.3).O\u03b42\nO\u03b42\nH\u03b41H\u03b41H\u03b41H\u03b41\nH\u03b41O\u03b42O\u03b42\nO\u03b42H\u03b41\nH\u03b41\nH\u03b41H\u03b41H\u03b41\n\u25b2 fig G  Hydr ogen bonding in water molecules, based on attraction \nbetween positive and negative dipoles.\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF WATER\nThe properties of  water make it very important in biological \nsystems for many reasons.\n \u2022W ater is a polar solvent. Because it is a polar molecule, many ionic \nsubstances like sodium chloride will dissolve in it (see fig H).  \nMany covalently bonded substances are also polar and will dissolve in water, but often do not dissolve in other covalently bonded solvents such as ethanol. Water also carries other substances, such as starch.

Not for resale, circulation or distribution in whole or in part. \u00a9Pearson 20187 1A.1 THE CHEMISTRY OF LIFE CHEMISTRY FOR BIOLOGISTS\n \u2022W ater is an excellent transport medium because the dipole \nnature of  water enables many different substances to dissolve \nin it (see Sections 1B.2, 4A.4 and 4A.5).\n \u2022As w\nater cools to 4\n \u00b0C, it r\neaches its maximum density. As it \ncools further, the molecules become more widely spaced. As a result, ice is less dense than water and floats, forming an insulating layer and helping to prevent the water underneath it from freezing. It also melts quickly because, being at the top, it is exposed to the sun. It is very unusual for the solid form of  a substance to be less dense than the liquid form. This unusual property enables organisms to live in water, even in countries where it gets cold enough to freeze in winter.\n \u2022W\nater is slow to absorb and release heat \u2013 it has a high specific \nheat capacity. The hydrogen bonds between the molecules need a lot of  energy to separate them. This means the temperature of  large bodies of  water such as lakes and seas does not change much throughout the year. This makes them good habitats for living organisms.\n \u2022W\nater is a liquid \u2013 it cannot be compressed. This is an \nimportant factor in many hydraulic mechanisms in living organisms.\n \u2022W\nater molecules are cohesive \u2013 the forces between the \nmolecules mean they stick together. This is very important for the movement of  water from the roots to the leaves of  plants (see Sections 4A.3 and 4A.4).\n \u2022W\nater molecules are adhesive \u2013 they are attracted to other \ndifferent molecules. This is also important in plant transport systems and in surface tension.\n \u2022W\nater has a very high surface tension because the attraction \nbetween the water molecules, including hydrogen bonds, is greater than the attraction between the water molecules and the air. As a result, the water molecules hold together forming a thin \u2018skin\u2019 of  surface tension. Surface tension is very important in plant transport systems, and also affects life at the surface of  ponds, lakes and other water masses (see fig I).\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that co means two similar things together, as in cohabit, \nand ad means two different things together.\n\u25b2 fig I Without surface tension, a r aft spider like this could not move \nacross the water and hunt.EXAM HINT\nAll these properties are a result of dipoles and hydrogen bonding between water molecules.

In theory, a minor cut could endanger life as the torn blood vessels \nallow blood to escape. First, your blood volume will reduce and if  you lose too much blood, you will die. Second, pathogens can get into your body through an open wound. In normal circumstances, your body protects you through the clotting mechanism of  the blood. This mechanism seals damaged blood vessels to minimise blood loss and prevent pathogens getting in.\nFORMING A CLOT\nPlasma, blood cells and platelets flow from a cut vessel.

They release several substances, two of  which are particularly important.\n \u2022Ser\notonin causes the smooth muscle of  the blood vessel to contract.

Here is a simple version of  the events in the blood clotting process.\n1\n T\nhromboplastin catalyses the conversion of  a large soluble protein called prothrombin found in \nthe plasma into another soluble protein, the enzyme called thrombin. Prothrombin is biologically \ninactive while thrombin is biologically active \u2013 prothrombin is a precursor of  thrombin. This conversion happens on a large scale at the site of  a wound. Calcium ions need to be present in the blood at the right concentration for this reaction to happen. \n2\n T\nhrombin acts on another soluble plasma protein called fibrinogen, converting it to an insoluble \nsubstance called fibrin.

These pages cover the facts behind the replication mechanism, as well as some of the history behind its discovery. This stuff is really clever. Honest.DNA Replicates by Semi-Conservative ReplicationDNA copies itself before cell division (see p. 32) so that each new cell has the full amount of DNA.The method is called semi-conservative replication because half of the strands in each new DNA moleculeare from the original DNA molecule. This means that there's genetic continuity between generations of cells (i.e. the cells produced by cell division inherit their genes from their parent cells).1)The enzyme DNA helicase breaks the hydrogen bondsbetween bases on the two polynucleotide DNA strands.

As the bacteria reproduced, they took up nitrogen from the broth to help make nucleotides for new DNA. So the nitrogen gradually became part of the bacteria's DNA.2) A sample of DNA was taken from each batch of bacteria, and spun in a centrifuge. The DNA from the heavy nitrogen bacteria settled lower down the centrifuge tube than the DNA from the light nitrogen bacteria \u2014 because it's heavier.3) Then the bacteria grown in the heavy nitrogen broth were taken out and put in a broth containing only light nitrogen. The bacteria were left for one round of DNA replication, and then another DNA sample was taken out and spun in the centrifuge.4) If replication was conservative, the original heavy DNA, which would still be together, would settle at the bottom and the new light DNA would settle at the top.5) If replication was semi-conservative, the new bacterial DNA molecules would contain one strand of the old DNA containing heavy nitrogen and one strand of new DNA containing light nitrogen. So the DNA would settle out between where the light nitrogen DNA settled out and where the heavy nitrogen DNA settled out.6) As it turned out, the DNA settled out in the middle, showing that the DNA molecules contained a mixture of heavy and light nitrogen. The bacterial DNA had replicated semi-conservatively in the light nitrogen.Once Meselson and Stahl had confirmed that DNA replication in bacteria was semi-conservative, other scientists carried out experiments to show that it was the universal method for DNA replication in all living things.Practice QuestionsQ1 What is the role of DNA helicase in DNA replication?Q2 What's the key difference between the conservative and semi-conservative theories of DNA replication?Exam QuestionQ1 Dcscribc the process of semi-conservative DNA replication.

The arteries and veins are like the large roads carrying heavy traffic while the narrow town streets and tracks are represented by the vast area of  branching and spreading capillaries called the capillary network. In the capillary network, substances carried by the blood are exchanged with cells in the same way that products are transported from factories, oil refineries or farms and distributed into shops and homes. The structures of  the different types of  blood vessel closely reflect their functions in your body.\nARTERIES\nArteries carry blood away from your heart towards the cells of  your body. The structure of  an artery is shown in fig A. Almost all arteries carry oxygenated blood. The exceptions are:\n \u2022the pulmonar\ny artery \u2013 carrying deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs\n \u2022the umbilical ar\ntery \u2013 during pregnancy, this carries deoxygenated blood from the fetus to  \nthe placenta.\nThe arteries leaving the heart branch off  in every direction, and the diameter of  the lumen, the central space inside the blood vessel, gets smaller the further away it is from the heart. The very smallest branches of  the arterial system, furthest from the heart, are the arterioles. \nThe middle layers of\nthe artery wall containelastic \ufb01bres and smoothmuscle; arteries nearestthe heart have more elastic\ufb01bres, those further fromthe heart have a greaterproportion of muscle tissue.\nelastic \ufb01bres andsmooth musclelumentough outerlayer\nendotheliumexternal layerof tough tissue\nThe endothelium forms asmooth lining which allows theeasiest possible \ufb02ow of blood.Lumen is small whenartery unstretched by\ufb02ow of blood from heart.\n\u25b2 fig A  T he structure of an artery means it is adapted to cope with the surging of the blood as the heart pumps.\nBlood is pumped out from the heart in a regular rhythm, about 70 times a minute. Each heartbeat \nsends a high-pressure flow of  blood into the arteries. The major arteries close to the heart must withstand these pressure surges. Their walls contain a lot of  elastic fibres, so they can stretch to accommodate the greater volume of  blood without being damaged (see fig B). Between surges, the elastic fibres return to their original length, squeezing the blood to move it along in a continuous flow. The pulse you can feel in an artery is the effect of  the surge each time the heart beats. The blood pressure in all arteries is relatively high, but it falls in arteries further away from the heart. These are known as the peripheral arteries. LEARNING TIP\nRemember that all arteries carry \nblood away from the heart, so they have thick walls and lots of collagen to withstand the high pressure.\nEXAM HINT\nYou will study the structure and the function of the types of blood vessel separately. However, you should remember that the vessels do not exist separately \u2013 they are all interlinked within the whole circulatory system.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

This is called recoil. The elastic recoil does not help to increase pressure, it simply helps to maintain the pressure \u2013 so do not suggest that the recoil helps pump blood along.\nIn the peripheral arteries, the muscle fibres in the vessel walls \ncontract or relax to change the size of  the lumen, controlling the blood flow. The smaller the lumen, the harder it is for blood to flow through the vessel. This controls the amount of  blood that flows into an organ, so regulating its activity. Y ou will find out more about this important response in Book 2 Topic 7.\n2.5 cmaorta\nelastic \ufb01bres\nsmooth muscle\ncollagen \ufb01bres\nelastic \ufb01bres\nsmooth muscle\ncollagen \ufb01bres\nelastic \ufb01bres\nsmooth muscle\ncollagen \ufb01bresmedium-sized artery\narteriole0.4 cm\n30 \/uni03BCm\n\u25b2 fig B  T he relative proportions of different tissues in different arteries. \nCollagen gives general strength and flexibility to both arteries and veins.\nLEARNING TIP\nThe role of the muscles in the wall of the arterioles is to reduce the size \nof the lumen to increase resistance \u2013 this can reduce blood flow to areas that do not need so much blood and will cause the oxygenated blood to flow to other tissues. Remember to link this to things you may learn later such as how blood flow to the skin changes when you are too hot or too cold.\nCAPILLARIES\nArterioles lead into networks of  capillaries. These are very small \nvessels that spread throughout the tissues of  the body. The capillary network links the arterioles and the venules. Capillaries branch between cells \u2013 no cell is far from a capillary, so substances can diffuse between cells and the blood quickly. Also, because the diameter of  each individual capillary is small, the blood travels relatively slowly through them, giving more opportunity for diffusion to occur (see fig C). The smallest capillary is no wider than a single red blood cell.\nCapillaries have a very simple structure which is well adapted \nto their function. Their walls are very thin and contain no elastic fibres, smooth muscle or collagen. This helps them fit between individual cells and allows rapid diffusion of  substances between the blood and the cells. The walls consist of  just one very thin cell. Oxygen and other molecules, such as digested food molecules and hormones, quickly diffuse out of  the blood in the capillaries into the nearby body cells, and carbon dioxide and other waste molecules diffuse into the capillaries. Blood entering the capillary network from the arteries is oxygenated. When it leaves, it carries less oxygen and more carbon dioxide.\nwaste material \ne.g. carbon dioxideoxygen andfood molecules\ncapillary wall(epithelial cells)\nsingle red blood cells\n\u25b2 fig C  T he very thin walls of capillaries allow rapid diffusion of oxygen, \ncarbon dioxide and digested food molecules.

They act as a blood reservoir. The blood pressure in the veins is relatively low \u2013 the pressure surges from the heart are eliminated before the blood reaches the capillary system. This blood at low pressure must be returned to the heart and lungs to be oxygenated again and recirculated.\nThe blood is not pumped back to the heart, it returns to the heart \nby means of  muscle pressure and one-way valves.\n \u2022Man\ny of  the larger veins are situated between the large muscle \nblocks of  the body, particularly in the arms and legs. When  the muscles contract during physical activity they squeeze these veins. The valves (see below) keep the blood travelling  in one direction and this squeezing helps to return the blood  to the heart. \n \u2022T\nhere are one-way valves at frequent intervals throughout \nthe venous system. These are called semilunar valves because of  their half-moon shape. They develop from infoldings of  the inner wall of  the vein. Blood can pass through towards the heart, but if  it starts to flow backwards the valves close, preventing any backflow (see fig E).semilunar\nvalve open muscle\ncontracte d\nvein\nveinmusclerelaxedsemilunar valve shutBlood moving in the direction of the heart forces the valve open, allowing the blood to \ufb02ow through.\nA back\ufb02ow of blood will close the valve, ensuring \nthat blood cannot \ufb02ow away from the heart.\n\u25b2 fig E  V alves in the veins make sure blood only flows in one direction \u2013 \ntowards the heart.

In \nmammals, the heart is a complex, four-chambered muscular organ that sits in the chest protected by the ribs and sternum. In an average lifetime, the heart beats about 3\n 000\n 000\n 000 (3 \u00d7 109) times and \nwill pump over 200\u00a0million litres of  blood \u2013 quite a workload.\nTHE STRUCTURE OF THE HEART\nThe human heart, like other mammalian hearts (see fig A), is not a single muscular pump but two pumps, joined and working in time together. The right side of  the heart receives blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs. The left side of  the heart receives blood from the lungs and pumps it to the body. The blood in each side of  the heart does not mix with the blood from the other side. The two sides are separated by a thick, muscular septum. The heart is made of  a unique type of  muscle, known as cardiac muscle, which has special properties \u2013 it can carry on contracting regularly without resting or getting fatigued. Y ou will study this in more detail in Book 2 Topic 7. Cardiac muscle has a good blood supply \u2013 the coronary arteries bring oxygenated blood to the tissue (see fig B). It also contains lots of  myoglobin, a respiratory pigment which has a stronger affinity for oxygen than haemoglobin. This myoglobin stores oxygen for the respiration needed to keep the heart contracting regularly.\nsuperior vena cavaright pulmonary artery\n(to right lung)\nthinner cardiac muscleof right ventricleaorta\naorta    \ufb02ow of oxygenated blood\n    \ufb02ow of deoxygenated bloodcarotid arteries\nto neck and head\nright pulmonary vein\n(from right lung)\nsemilunar valve\nright atrium\ntricuspid valve\ninferior vena cavaleft pulmonary artery (to left lung)\napex of heart\nseptumleft atrium\nsemilunar valve\nthick cardiacmuscle of leftventricleleft pulmonaryvein (from leftlung)\ntendinous cordsbicuspid valve\n\u25b2 fig A  T he structure of the human heart\n\u25b2 fig B  T he coronary arteries, \nwhich you can clearly see here, carry oxygenated blood from the aorta to the heart muscle, providing it with oxygen and digested food and removing carbon dioxide.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Make it clear that both atria pump at the same time and both ventricles pump at the same time.\n1 T he inferior vena cava collects deoxygenated blood from the \nlower parts of  the body, while the superior vena cava receives \ndeoxygenated blood from the head, neck, arms and chest. Deoxygenated blood is delivered to the right atrium.\n2\n T\nhe right atrium receives the blood from the great veins. As it \nfills with blood, the pressure builds up and opens the tricuspid valve, so the right ventricle starts to fill with blood too. When the atrium is full it contracts, forcing more blood into the ventricle. The atrium has thin muscular walls because it receives blood at low pressure from the inferior vena cava and the superior vena cava and it needs to exert relatively little pressure to move the blood into the ventricle. One-way semilunar valves (like the valves in veins described in Section\u00a01B.3) at the entrance to the atrium stop a backflow of  blood into the veins.\n3\n \nThe tricuspid valve consists of  three flaps and is also \nknown as an atrioventricular valve because it separates an atrium from a ventricle. The valve allows blood to pass from the atrium to the ventricle, but not in the other direction. The tough tendinous cords, also known as valve tendons or heartstrings, make sure the valves are not turned inside out by the pressure exerted when the ventricles contract.\n4\n T\nhe right ventricle is filled with blood under some pressure \nwhen the right atrium contracts, then the ventricle contracts. Its muscular walls produce the pressure needed to force blood out of  the heart into the pulmonary arteries. These carry the deoxygenated blood to the capillaries in the lungs. As the ventricle starts to contract, the tricuspid valve closes to prevent blood flowing into the atrium. Semilunar valves, like those in veins, prevent the blood flowing back from the arteries into the ventricle.\n5\n T\nhe blood returns from the lungs to the left side of  the heart in \nthe pulmonary veins. The blood is at relatively low pressure after passing through the extensive capillaries of  the lungs. The blood returns to the left atrium, another thin-walled chamber that performs the same function as the right atrium. It contracts to force blood into the left ventricle. Backflow is prevented by another atrioventricular valve known as the bicuspid valve , which has only two flaps.\n6\n As the left a\ntrium contracts, the bicuspid valve opens and the \nleft ventricle is filled with blood under pressure. As the left ventricle starts to contract the bicuspid valve closes to prevent backflow of  blood to the left atrium. The left ventricle pumps the blood out of  the heart and into the aorta, the major artery of  the body. This carries blood away from the heart at even higher pressure than the major arteries that branch off  from it. \nThe muscular wall of  the left side of  the heart is much thicker than that of  the right. The right side pumps blood to the lungs, which are relatively close to the heart. The delicate capillaries of  the lungs need blood delivered at relatively low pressure. The left side must produce sufficient force to move the blood under pressure to all the extremities of  the body and overcome the elastic recoil of  the arteries. Semilunar valves prevent the blood flowing back from the aorta into the ventricle.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that the valves do not operate on their own. They open \nand close as blood pressure changes in the chambers on either side of the valve. When the pressure is higher on one side it will push the valve open. When it is higher on the other side, it will close the valve.\nThe septum is a thick wall of  muscle and connective tissue \nbetween the two sides of  the heart. It prevents the oxygenated blood mixing with the deoxygenated blood. \nDID YOU KNOW? \nIn an embryo, there is a gap in the septum called the foramen ovale and the blood from the two sides of the heart can mix. This does not matter because the lungs of the fetus do not function and little blood flows to them. At birth, this hole closes over as the lungs begin to function. If it does not, the baby has a condition called patent foramen ovale or \u2018hole in the heart\u2019 . This may be  so small it does not really matter. If it is large, it must be closed  by surgery.\nDID YOU KNOW? \nInside the heart\nThe diagrams we use of the inside of a mammalian heart make it \nlook very clean and simple (see fig A). But when you dissect the heart of a mammal such as a sheep or a cow, you can see that it is much more complicated. Cutting open a heart and exploring the connections between the blood vessels and the chambers of the heart, and seeing the structure of the valves, helps you understand how it works as a three-dimensional pump (see fig C).\n\u25b2 fig C  A dissected mammalian heart\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

The sounds are not made by the contracting of  the heart muscle but by the heart valves closing. The two sounds of  a heartbeat are often described as \u2018lub-dub\u2019. The first sound (\u2018lub\u2019) comes when the ventricles contract and the blood is forced against the atrioventricular valves. The second sound (\u2018dub\u2019) comes when the ventricles relax and a backflow of  blood hits the semilunar valves in the pulmonary artery and aorta. The rate of  your heartbeat shows how frequently your heart is contracting.\nTHE CARDIAC CYCLE\nY our heart is continuously contracting then relaxing. The contraction of  the heart is called systole. Systole can be divided into atrial systole, when the atria contract together forcing blood into the ventricles, and ventricular systole, when the ventricles contract. Ventricular systole happens about 0.13 seconds after atrial systole, and forces blood out of  the ventricles into the pulmonary artery and the aorta. Between contractions the heart relaxes and fills with blood. This relaxation stage is called diastole. One cycle of  systole and diastole makes up a single heartbeat, which lasts about 0.8\u00a0seconds in humans. This is known as the cardiac cycle (see fig D).

Globally, almost 18\u00a0million \npeople die from cardiovascular diseases each year. World Health Organization (WHO) data from 2017 show that cardiovascular diseases were responsible for 31% of  all global deaths \u2013 it is the single biggest cause of  death and disability (see fig A). What is more, around a third of  these deaths were in people younger than 70.\nMany cardiovascular diseases are linked to a condition called atherosclerosis.\nATHEROSCLEROSIS\nAtherosclerosis, a hardening of  the arteries, is a disease in which plaques (made of  a yellowish fatty \nsubstance) build up on the inside of  arteries. It can begin in late childhood and continues throughout life. A plaque can continue to develop until it restricts the flow of  blood through the artery or even blocks it completely. Plaques are most likely to form in the arteries of  the heart (coronary arteries) and neck (carotid arteries). The typical development of  a plaque is summarised in fig B.\nartery walls\nSlight damage to the endothelial cells lining\nthe artery leads to an in\ufb02ammatory response,followed by a build-up of cholestero l.smooth normalendothelium\nThe fatty deposits grow to form an atheroma.\nFibrous tissue and calcium salts build up ar\nound\nthe atheroma forming a hardened plaque which\nnarrows the artery and makes the walls rigid.\n\u25b2 fig B  T he development of atherosclerosis \nWe can now look at this development in more detail. Atherosclerosis begins with damage to the \nendothelial lining of  blood vessels. This damage can be caused by several factors, including high blood pressure and substances in tobacco smoke. Atherosclerosis usually occurs in arteries rather than in veins. This is because the blood in the arteries flows fast under relatively high pressure, which puts more strain on the endothelial lining of  the vessels and can cause small areas of  damage. In the veins, the pressure is lower so damage to the endothelium is much less likely.cardiovascular diseases\n31%\n27%9%33%communicable (infectious)\ndiseases, childbirth andnutritional conditions \ninjuries\nall other causes\ncardiovascular diseases\n31%\n27%9%33%communicable (infectious)\ndiseases, childbirth andnutritional conditions \ninjuries\nall other causes\n\u25b2 fig A  T his WHO data from 2017 \nshows cardiovascular disease is the biggest single cause of death around the world.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that damage to the \nendothelium occurs first and this is often caused by high blood pressure, often as a result of smoking.\nEXAM HINT\nLearn the stages of the development of atherosclerosis: damage to the endothelium of the arteries \u2192 inflammatory response \u2192 accumulation of cholesterol \u2192 atheroma \u2192 fibrous tissue\/calcium salts \u2192 plaque \u2192 narrowing\/loss of elasticity of the artery.1.11 1.10\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion. Not for resale, circulation or distribution in whole or in part. \u00a9Pearson 201845 1B.5 ATHEROSCLEROSIS MAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS\nOnce damage to the endothelium has occurred, the body\u2019s inflammatory response begins and \nwhite blood cells arrive at the site of  the damage. These cells accumulate chemicals from the blood, especially cholesterol. This leads to a plaque (also known as an atheroma) forming on the endothelial lining of  the artery (see fig C). Fibrous tissue and calcium salts also build up (increase in amount) around the atheroma, turning it into a hardened plaque. This hardened area means that part of  the artery wall is less elastic and narrower than it should be. This is atherosclerosis and is summarised in fig B.\nThe plaque causes the lumen of  the artery to become much smaller. This increases the blood \npressure, making it harder for the heart to pump blood around the body. The raised blood pressure makes damage more likely in other areas of  the endothelial lining and more plaques will form.  This will make the blood pressure even higher, and so the problem gets worse. There are many factors that are linked to the development of  atherosclerosis. Y ou will look at these in more detail  in Chapter 1C.\nEFFECT OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS ON HEALTH\nAtherosclerosis can have many serious effects on the health of  an individual. The development  of  atherosclerosis can be summarised as: damage to the endothelium of  the arteries \u2192 inflammatory response \u2192 accumulation of  cholesterol \u2192 atheroma \u2192 fibrous tissue\/calcium salts \u2192 plaque \u2192 narrowing\/loss of  elasticity of  the artery.\nANEURYSMS\nIf  an area of  an artery is narrowed by plaque, blood tends to collect behind the blockage. The artery bulges and the wall is put under more pressure than usual, so it becomes weakened. This is known as an aneurysm. The weakened artery wall may split open, leading to massive internal bleeding. Aneurysms frequently happen in the blood vessels supplying the brain or in the aorta, especially when it passes through the abdomen. The massive blood loss and drop in blood pressure are often fatal, but if  aneurysms are diagnosed they can be treated by surgery before they burst.\nRAISED BLOOD PRESSURE\nThe arteries narrowed due to plaques on the walls cause raised blood pressure. This can lead to severe damage in a number of  organs, including the kidneys, the eyes and the brain. The high pressure damages the tiny blood vessels where your kidney filters out urea and other substances from the blood. If  the vessels feeding the kidney tubules become narrowed, the pressure inside them gets even higher and proteins may be forced out through their walls. If  you have high blood pressure, your doctors can test for protein in your urine as a sign of  kidney damage. \nSimilarly, the tiny blood vessels supplying the retina of  your eye are easily damaged. If  they become \nblocked or leak, the retinal cells are starved of  oxygen and die and this can cause blindness. \nBleeding from the capillaries into the brain results in one type of  stroke (see below).\nHEART DISEASE\nThere are many kinds of  heart disease, but the two most common ones are angina and myocardial \ninfarction (heart attack); both are closely linked to atherosclerosis (see figs B and D ).\nIn angina, plaques build up slowly in the coronary arteries, reducing blood flow to the parts of  the heart muscle beyond the plaques. Often symptoms are first noticed during exercise, when the cardiac muscle is working harder and needs more oxygen. The narrowed coronary arteries cannot supply enough oxygenated blood and the heart muscle resorts to anaerobic respiration. This causes a gripping pain in the chest that can extend into the arms, particularly the left one, and the jaw, and often also causes breathlessness. The symptoms of  angina subside once exercise stops, but the experience is painful and frightening.\nFortunately, most angina is relatively mild. It can be helped by taking regular exercise, losing weight \nand not smoking. The symptoms can be treated by drugs that cause rapid dilation of  the coronary blood vessels so that they supply the cardiac muscle with the oxygen it needs. However, if  the blockage of  the coronary arteries continues to get worse, so will the symptoms of  the angina. Other drugs are then used to dilate the blood vessels and reduce the heart rate. Unfortunately, drugs cannot \n\u25b2 fig C  F atty deposits like these \nin an artery cause disease and death in millions of people  every year.\nEXAM HINT\nMake sure you are clear about \nall of the different terms.

A small tube called a stent \nmay be inserted into the coronary arteries to hold them open, or heart bypass surgery may be carried out. \nnarrowed artery\n\u25b2 fig D  Injecting the blood v essels with special dye allows doctors to see \nwhere the coronary arteries are narrowing due to atherosclerosis so they \ncan treat the problem.\nEXAM HINT\nBe clear that angina and myocardial infarction are caused by reduced \nblood flow to the cardiac muscle \u2013 if you say \u2018to the heart\u2019 this suggests reduced flow in the veins carrying blood into the atria rather than arteries carrying oxygenated blood to the muscle itself.\nIn a myocardial infarction, often called a heart attack, one of the \nbranches of the coronary artery becomes completely blocked and part of the heart muscle is permanently starved of oxygen.\nMany heart attacks are caused by a blood clot resulting from \natherosclerosis. As you have seen, the wall of  an artery affected  by a plaque is stiffened, making it much more likely to suffer cracks or damage. Platelets touch the damaged surface of  the plaque and the clotting process is triggered (see Section 1B.2). The plaque itself  may rupture and break open, and the cholesterol that is released will also cause the platelets to trigger the blood clotting process. A clot may also develop because the endothelial lining is damaged, for example by high blood pressure or smoking.\nA clot that forms in a blood vessel is known as a thrombosis.  \nThe clot can rapidly block the whole blood vessel, particularly if  it is already narrowed by a plaque. A clot that gets stuck in a coronary artery is known as a coronary thrombosis. The clot  can block the artery, starving the heart muscle beyond that point of  oxygen and nutrients, and this often leads to a heart attack  (see fig E).Blargest heart attack\n(cardiac arre st) follows\nif blockage is at C\nmedium heart attack \u2013 death \nof some heart tissue if blockage is at Bsmall heart attack \u2013 death of small amount of heart tissue if blockage is at AABC\n\u25b2 fig E  T he size and severity of a heart attack is closely related to the \nposition of the blockage in the coronary artery.\nDuring a heart attack, there is chest pain in the same areas as in \nan angina attack, but it is much more severe. The pain may occur at any time, although exercise may start it, and it often lasts for several hours. Death may occur very rapidly with no previous symptoms, or it may happen after several days of  feeling tired and suffering symptoms mistaken for indigestion.\nIt is very important to react quickly if  you suspect someone is \nhaving a heart attack. Give them two full-strength aspirin tablets to help stop the blood clotting, and get them to hospital as fast as you can.\nSTROKES\nA stroke is caused by an interruption to the normal blood supply to an area of  the brain. This may be due to bleeding from damaged capillaries or a blockage cutting off  the blood supply to the brain. A blockage is usually caused by a blood clot, an atheroma or a combination of  the two. Sometimes, the blood clot forms somewhere else in the body and is carried in the bloodstream until it gets stuck in an artery in the brain. The damage happens very quickly. A blockage in one of  the main arteries leading to the brain causes a very serious stroke that may lead to death. In one of  the smaller arterioles leading into the brain, the effects may be less disastrous.\nThe symptoms of  strokes vary, depending on how much of  the \nbrain is affected. Very often, the blood is cut off  from one part or one side of  the brain only (see fig F). Symptoms include dizziness, confusion, slurred speech, blurred vision or partial loss of  vision (usually one eye) and numbness. In more severe strokes, there can be paralysis, usually on one side of  the body.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

The healthy part of the brain is shown in blue.\nThe outcome of  either a heart attack or a stroke usually depends \non how soon the person is treated. The sooner the patient is given treatment, including clot-busting drugs that break down or dissolve the blood clot, the more likely they are to survive. For example, if  treatment is given rapidly, 75% of  patients who survive the first week after a heart attack can expect to be alive five years later.\nCHECKPOINT \n1.   W hen a plaque starts to form on the endothelium (lining) of an \nartery, it usually gets worse and worse.

Some of  these diseases \naffect you randomly \u2013 there is nothing you can do to change whether you are affected or not. However, for many diseases, especially non-communicable (non-infectious) conditions such as heart disease \nand cancer, you can increase or lower your risk of  becoming ill, based on factors in your lifestyle. If  you understand the risk factors, you can help to make yourself  and your family healthier.\nWHAT IS RISK?\nThe word risk is used regularly in everyday conversation, but in science it has a very specific meaning. In science, risk describes the probability that an event will happen. Probability means the chance or likelihood of  the event, calculated mathematically. For example, imagine you have six coloured balls \u2013 red, blue, green, yellow, orange and purple \u2013 in a black cloth bag (see fig A). If  you reach in and pull out a single ball, the probability (risk) of  getting, say, a green ball can be expressed in one of  three ways:\n \u20221 in 6\n \u20220.166\n 66 r\necurring (0.17)\n \u202217%.\nT\nhis is the case for any one of  the six colours in the bag. In the same way, it is possible to work out \nyour risk of  developing certain specified diseases or of  dying from a specified cause. \nHOW DO WE PERCEIVE RISK? \nThe actual risk of  doing something is not always the same as the sense of  risk one feels. Most people don\u2019t think twice before getting into their car \u2013 but globally you have an annual risk of  1 in 5747 of  being killed in a road traffic accident. On the other hand, many people get very worried before flying, but commercial flights have a 1 in 4.5\u20135.5\u00a0million risk of  crashing. Personal perception of  risk is based on a variety of  factors which include: \n \u2022ho\nw familiar you are with the activity \n \u2022ho\nw much you enjoy the activity\n \u2022w\nhether or not you approve of  the activity. \nThe actual mathematical risk may play very little part in developing your personal perception of  risk. People often overestimate the benefits, or minimise the risk, of  behaviour that they want to continue. For example, there is now strong evidence from around the world that obesity is linked to a range of  diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers. However, people like eating and so they still become overweight. On the other hand, they will over-emphasise the risks of  activities if  they want to avoid them or prevent others from doing them. For example, parents over-emphasise the risk of  wandering away to small children, to help make the child behave and stay close.\nIn another example, there is good scientific evidence that smoking affects our risk of  developing \ndiseases such as atherosclerosis, as well as lung cancer. However, knowledge of  the mathematical risk of  an early death if  you smoke cigarettes doesn\u2019t always stop people from smoking.\u25b2 fig A  T he risk, chance or \nprobability that you will pick a blue ball out of the black bag is 1 in 6. If\u00a0you return the ball to the bag each time, you will have exactly the same probability of picking a blue ball again the next time. The probability will always be 1\u00a0in 6.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

But the risk is higher for some people than others, depending on their lifestyle and which genes they inherit.\nIt is possible to identify the risk factors that may contribute to \nthe cause of  a disease. Y ou can look at people who have the same factors (e.g. smoking) and compare their risk of  the disease with the average risk for the whole population. Using these techniques, it appears that there are a number of  factors that increase the likelihood that a person will develop atherosclerosis. If  many factors influence your chance of  having a disease, it is called a multifactorial disease. The study of  the patterns of  diseases and their causes is called epidemiology.\nWhen two different sets of  data change together, there may be a \nlink, which is called a correlation. For example, mortality data from a disease such as atherosclerosis may change in a similar pattern to a lifestyle factor such as smoking or lack of  exercise. However, this does not prove that one is the cause of  the other. They could both be caused by something else which would explain why they change in the same way. Correlation is not the same as causation \u2013 further research is always needed to demonstrate a causal link.\nFor example, fig B shows the percentage of  deaths in the  \nUAE from cardiovascular disease each year. It also shows the statistics for obesity and diabetes. This data suggests a possible correlation between obesity and heart disease. \nDeaths from CVD05101520253035404550\nObesePercentage of the population affected\nOverweight Diabetes33%47.5%\n13%31%\n\u25b2 fig B  T his data shows a possible correlation between obesity, diabetes \nand death from cardiovascular disease (CVD). It needs more data from other sources to show that obesity can cause diabetes and CVD.\nEXAM HINT\nWhen provided with data in the form of a graph, make sure you read \nthe axis titles carefully so that you know what the data refers to.Y ou cannot base conclusions on a single set of  data. However, \nthese UAE data agree with findings from countries around the world that suggest obesity is closely linked to the development of  diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Dr Raghib Ali, principle investigator in the UAE Healthy Future Study, has set up a long-term study in Abu Dhabi. The team is aiming to collect the data needed to confirm the pattern of  increased disease risk in the UAE \u2013 and so to find ways of  reducing the risk of  diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\nCHECKPOINT \n1.    Explain the diff erence between risk, correlation and causation.\n2.\n   In most are\nas of the world, the risk of dying from heart disease \nis about three times greater for smokers than for non-smokers. \nExplain why this does not mean that an individual person who smokes will die from heart disease. \nSKILLS PERSONAL AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\n3.   The risks of de veloping diabetes and heart disease linked to \nobesity are well known.

Eat fruit and vegetables, drink orange juice, take lots of  exercise, enjoy these foods \u2013 how do we know which advice is based on good science, and which is given to us because someone wants to sell us something? There are many ways in which you can evaluate the design of  studies to decide if  the data are meaningful.\nDESIGNING STUDIES\nMost epidemiological studies are based on a very big sample size \u2013 usually, the bigger the study, the more meaningful the results. \nThe ideal is to investigate one factor or variable, keeping all other \nvariables the same (controlled). However, controlling variables is almost impossible when you are working with human beings. The way people live is complex and varies a lot, so it is hard to detect how any one factor affects people. When a larger number of  people are studied, it is more likely that patterns may emerge, even with all the other differences between the people involved. Evidence based on large amounts of  data is more likely to be statistically significant than evidence based on small studies.\nSome epidemiological studies are carried out over a long time. \nThese longitudinal studies are very valuable because they follow the same group of  individuals over many years (see fig\u00a0A). This means the impact of  their known lifestyle on their health can be tracked over time. For example, the M\u00fcnster Heart Study looked at cardiovascular disease in 10\n 856 men a\nged 36\u201365 in \nEurope, following them from the start of  the study well into the 21st century. The results from this study are still seen as important because so many people were involved over a long period of  time. The Framingham Study in the US also provided much data \u2013 but was limited because they were all from similar American citizens. The study started in 1948 and it is still going on \u2013 the scientists have widened the population they gather data from, so it is more relevant now.\nAn ambitious new study called the National Children\u2019s Study has \nbeen set up in the US to follow 100\n 000 childr\nen from birth until \nthey are 21 years old. From 2008\u20132012, children were selected to be representative of  the whole of  the US population. One major objective of  the study is to examine how environmental inputs and genetic factors interact to affect the health and development of  children. This is believed to be the biggest longitudinal study ever set up. Similarly, the UAE Healthy Future Study will be longitudinal, looking at the same group of  volunteers over a number of  years.\nSometimes, scientists look at all the available studies in a subject \narea and analyse the available data in a massive literature study. This combines small and large studies and can give more reliable evidence than any one of  the studies alone. This is called a metadata analysis (meta-analysis).\nEVALUATING SCIENTIFIC STUDIES\nWhen considering a study, you need to examine the methodology to see if  it is valid. That means that it is properly designed to answer the question or questions being asked. Y ou also need to see if  the measurements have been carried out with precision. It is important to find out if  other scientists have been able to repeat the methodology and have had similar results \u2013 if  so, the results are considered more reliable.\nIt is also important to know who carried out the research, who \nfunded it and where it was published. Then to decide whether or not any of  these factors might have affected or biased the study. Y ou need to evaluate the data and conclusions from the study in the light of  all these factors.\nEXAM HINT\nRemember the meaning of the following terms.\nValid: answers the question the scientists are askingPrecise: measurements with little difference between themReliable: the investigation is repeatable by other scientists who get \nsimilar results\nThey are important in evaluating all practical work and research.\nIn the next few pages, you are going to look at some of  the \nevidence that scientists have collected suggesting factors that may \u2013 or may not \u2013 affect your risk of  developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In each case, you need to look carefully at the type of  evidence that is presented and think about what else you need to know to make firm conclusions.\nRISK FACTORS FOR CVDs\nThe results from many epidemiological studies have identified a range of  risk factors linked to CVDs. These factors divide into two main groups \u2013 those you can\u2019t change and those you can do something about (see Section 1C.3).\nNON-MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS FOR ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nThere are three main risk factors for CVDs which cannot (at the present time) be changed.\n \u2022Genes\n: studies show that there is a genetic tendency (trend) \nin some families, and also in some ethnic groups, to develop CVDs. These trends can include\u2013\n ar\nteries which are easily damaged\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

This can make you more likely \nto suffer from CVDs, particularly heart disease.\n \u2022Gender\n: statistically, under the age of  50, men are more likely \nto suffer from heart disease (and other CVDs) than women. The female hormone oestrogen, which is an important factor in the woman\u2019s menstrual cycle, appears to reduce the build-up of  plaque. This gives women some protection against CVDs until they go through the menopause when oestrogen levels fall.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that risk factors do not cause the disease, they contribute \nto the chances of developing the disease.\nLOOKING AT THE DATA\nIdentical twin studies are an excellent resource when investigating \nwhether there is a genetic factor at work, because identical twins have exactly the same genes. Any differences should therefore be due to the environment in which they live. A major twin study was conducted in Sweden and was based on over 21\n 000 pair\ns of  twins, \nboth identical and non-identical. This study showed that (for male twins) if  one twin died of  heart disease between the ages of  36 and 55, then the risk of  the other twin also dying of  heart disease was eight times higher than if  neither was affected (see fig A). However, as the twins got older, one dying of  heart disease had less of  a correlation with the other twin also dying of  heart disease. In other words, there appears to be a clear genetic link to heart disease in younger men, but it gets less in much older men. \nEpidemiological studies have also identified several lifestyle \nfactors linked to CVDs, some of  which you will look at in the following pages. These lifestyle factors are important for health because they are the factors that we can change.\nCHECKPOINT \nSKILLS EXECUTIVE FUNCTION\n1.

Polymers are large, complex molecules composed of long chains of monomers joined together. Monomers are small, basic molecular units. Examples of monomers include monosaccharides, amino acids, and nucleotides. Carbohydrates are made from monosaccharides, which contain the elements C, H, and O. The monomers that carbohydrates are made from are monosaccharides, for example, glucose, fructose, and galactose. Glucose is a hexose sugar \u2014 a monosaccharide with six carbon atoms in each molecule. There are two types of glucose, alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2) \u2014 they're isomers, molecules with the same molecular formula as each other but with the atoms connected in a different way. You need to know the structures of both types of glucose for your exam\u2014 it's pretty easy because there's only one difference between the two: \u03b1-glucose and \u03b2-glucose have the atom groups at the position of carbon number one reversed.\n\n@@@The Formation of Disaccharides Through Condensation Reactions\nA condensation reaction is when two molecules join together with the formation of a new chemical bond, and a water molecule is released when the bond is formed. Monosaccharides are joined together by condensation reactions. A glycosidic bond forms between the two monosaccharides as a molecule of water is released. A disaccharide is formed when two monosaccharides join together. For example, two \u03b1-glucose molecules are joined together by a glycosidic bond to form maltose. Sucrose is a disaccharide formed from a condensation reaction between a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule. Lactose is another disaccharide formed from a glucose molecule and a galactose molecule. If you're asked to show a condensation reaction, don't forget to include the water molecule as a product.\n\n@@@Hydrolysis Reactions and the Breakdown of Polymers\nPolymers can be broken down into monomers by hydrolysis reactions. A hydrolysis reaction breaks the chemical bond between monomers using a water molecule. It's the opposite of a condensation reaction. For example, carbohydrates can be broken down into their constituent monosaccharides by hydrolysis reactions. \n\n@@@Testing for Sugars Using the Benedict\u2019s Test\nSugar is a general term for monosaccharides and disaccharides. All sugars can be classified as reducing or non-reducing. The Benedict's test is used for detecting the presence of sugars and differs depending on the type of sugar you are testing for. Reducing sugars include all monosaccharides (e.g., glucose) and some disaccharides (e.g., maltose and lactose). To perform the test, you add Benedict's reagent, which is blue, to a sample and heat it in a water bath that's been brought to the boil. If the test is positive, it will form a coloured precipitate. The colour of the precipitate changes from blue to green, to yellow, to orange, and then brick red. The higher the concentration of reducing sugar, the further the colour change goes; this allows you to compare the amount of reducing sugar in different solutions. A more accurate way of doing this is to filter the solution and weigh the precipitate. Always use an excess of Benedict's solution to ensure all the sugar reacts. If the result of the reducing sugars test is negative, there could still be a non-reducing sugar present. To test for non-reducing sugars, like sucrose, you have to break them down into monosaccharides by treating a new sample with dilute hydrochloric acid and carefully heating it in a water bath to the boil. Then you neutralize it with sodium hydrogencarbonate and perform the Benedict's test as you would for a reducing sugar. If the test is positive, a coloured precipitate will form. If the test is negative, the solution remains blue, indicating it does not contain any sugar (either reducing or non-reducing).","2":"@@@Overview of Eukaryotic Cells and Organelles\n\nEukaryotic cells contain a variety of organelles, each with specific functions crucial to the life of the cell. The majority of these organelles are membrane-bound, which is a source of common confusion. It's essential to remember that these organelles are not independent cells but parts of a larger cell. This segment emphasizes the need to understand both the structure and function of these organelles.\n\n@@@Cell-surface (Plasma) Membrane\n\nThe cell-surface membrane plays a pivotal role in regulating the passage of substances in and out of the cell. It acts as a selective barrier for animal cells and is found just inside the cell wall of other cells. Made predominantly from lipids and proteins, this structure is equipped with receptor molecules, making it responsive to chemicals such as hormones.\n\n@@@Nucleus\n\nThe nucleus, surrounded by a double membrane known as the nuclear envelope, administers the cell's activities by controlling DNA transcription. The nuclear envelope is perforated with pores that allow substances like RNA to move between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Inside the nucleus are chromosomes consisting of protein-bound linear DNA, along with one or more nucleoli, which are responsible for making ribosomes.\n\n@@@Mitochondrion\n\nMitochondria are often oval-shaped organelles with a double membrane, where the inner membrane forms cristae. Within the internal matrix, enzymes involved in respiration are located. Mitochondria are the sites of aerobic respiration and ATP production, which is particularly important in cells that demand a high amount of energy.\n\n@@@Chloroplast\n\nIn plant and algal cells, the chloroplast is a small, flattened structure enclosed by a double membrane. Inside are thylakoid membranes, which in parts form structures called grana\u2014these grana are interlinked by lamellae. Chloroplasts are the location for photosynthesis, with the processes occurring in both the grana and the stroma, a dense fluid within the chloroplast.\n\n@@@Golgi Apparatus and Related Structures\n\nThe Golgi apparatus consists of a group of fluid-filled, membrane-bound sacs, also known as cisternae, with vesicles frequently seen at their edges. This organelle processes and packages new lipids and proteins and produces lysosomes. Golgi vesicles are small sacs used to store and transport lipids and proteins out of the cell. Lysosomes, which are a form of Golgi vesicle, contain lysozymes that digest invading cells or worn-out cell components.\n\n@@@Ribosomes and Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)\n\nRibosomes, which may be free-floating in the cytoplasm or attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), are the sites of protein synthesis. They are composed of RNA and proteins but do not have a membrane. The RER is covered with ribosomes and specializes in folding and processing proteins. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), on the other hand, lacks ribosomes and is involved in the synthesis and processing of lipids.\n\n@@@Cell Wall and Cell Vacuole\n\nSurrounding plant cells, algae, and fungal cells is the cell wall\u2014a rigid structure that provides support and maintains the shape of the cell. The plant and algal cell wall is primarily composed of cellulose, while the fungal cell wall is made of chitin. Plant cells also contain a cell vacuole, a large organelle responsible for maintaining cell pressure, which helps prevent wilting and is also involved in isolating unwanted chemicals within the cell. The vacuole's membrane is known as the tonoplast.","3":"@@@Introduction to Business Objectives and Strategies\nThis chapter delves into AS Level syllabus section 1.4, outlining the significance of business objectives. It articulates that while businesses may state the general objectives in their Memorandum of Association, strategic details are often scant. The chapter aims to shed light on why business objectives are imperative, the variety of goals that can exist, and how they can serve in guiding an organization\u2019s workforce. Objectives provide clarity and a distinct direction for nearly all human endeavors. For businesses, an objective can streamline management, guide decision-making, and warrant that all company actions are aligned with the established targets. \n\n@@@Understanding the Importance of SMART Objectives\nUpon completing this chapter, the reader will comprehend the importance of setting objectives and the necessity for them to be SMART\u2014Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Readers will also gain insights into the connections between mission statements, corporate objectives, and business strategy, the dynamics between objectives and strategies, and the significance of conveying objectives to stakeholders like employees. Moreover, the chapter discusses why objectives may evolve over time and critically examines the influence of corporate social responsibility and ethics on business aims and activities.\n\n@@@Case Study: Health and Beauty for You\nJune Wong reflects on the success of Health and Beauty for You, which she started with her brother Will. Despite economic challenges and competition, their primary goal of business survival was met over the initial three years. Subsequently, they plan to set new objectives, with June proposing expansion through acquiring another salon to bolster growth, while Will advocates for maximizing profits from the current salon. Through discussion, they arrive at a dual-phase objective: initially, to open a new salon and double sales within three years; subsequently, to focus on long-term profit maximization by enhancing their image and raising prices\u2014with a five-year profit target of $90,000 per year.\n\n@@@Points to Ponder and Case Continuation\nThe reader is prompted to reflect on the definition of 'objective', the importance of Health and Beauty for You having clear objectives, and the reasons behind June and Will\u2019s prospective shift in business goals over time. Following this, the text details that businesses, from small sole-trader enterprises to large corporations, benefit from clear and well-defined objectives. While sole traders might not formalize their goals, they typically have a clear vision. The importance of aligned objectives for partnerships and the necessity for limited companies to declare their overarching business objectives are highlighted. Businesses need to frequently review their strategies to ensure continuous alignment with objectives, acknowledging that objectives and strategies may change with time; for example, a shift in objective likely necessitates a revised strategy.\n\n@@@Exploring the Attributes of Effective Business Objectives\nThe text then details that the most effective business objectives are characterized by the SMART criteria, providing specific examples for each of the 'SMART' components. It emphasizes setting specific goals pertinent to a business\u2019s nature, establishing measurable targets, ensuring objectives are realistically achievable, aligning them with the company\u2019s resources, and setting clear time frames.\n\n@@@Understanding the Hierarchy of Business Objectives and Strategies\nAn analysis follows on the distinction between corporate aims, mission statements, objectives, and strategies, exemplified through a hierarchy of objectives figure. The case of Daimler Mercedes-Benz is presented, showcasing a corporate goal of achieving profitable growth and leading the automobile industry. Corporate aims are discussed as broad and overarching, providing directional guidance across the various aspects and levels of a business. The reader is engaged through an activity to explain the benefits of company aims and objectives to Daimler, complementing the detailed exploration of business objectives provided in the chapter.","4":"@@@The Significance of Objectives in Decision-Making\nEffective decision-making in business management is deeply tied to having clear objectives. Managers are tasked with crafting future strategies, which can only be accomplished with a well-defined direction for the business. This crucial relationship between decisions and business objectives is encapsulated in the decision-making framework model depicted in Figure 4.4. The framework for making decisions involves a multi-step process, which includes setting objectives, assessing the problem or situation, gathering relevant data, evaluating decision options, making the strategic decision, implementing the plan, and reviewing its success in the context of the original goals. Without these objectives outlined from the beginning, making any influential decisions for the future of the business would not only be challenging but also unproductive.\n\n@@@The Evolution of Corporate Objectives Over Time\nCorporate objectives do not remain static and often evolve, driven by various circumstances. A startup, having achieved initial survival objectives, may shift focus to scaling or profit maximization. Market dynamics such as the emergence of a formidable competitor or economic downturns can compel a firm to adjust its objectives, shifting from aggressive expansion back to mere survival or revising sales and profit goals downwards. Short-term growth ambitions, such as increasing sales or market share, may transform into long-term profit-maximization aims once a higher sales level is attained.\n\n@@@Determinants of a Business's Corporate Objectives\nA myriad of factors can sway the specific objectives set by a business. Corporate culture stands out as a key influencer \u2013 it embodies the shared attitudes and behaviors that guide the decision-making of managers and employees within an organization. Depending on whether the corporate culture is aggressive and competitive or socially conscious and people-oriented, the business's objectives will significantly vary. Moreover, the size and legal structure of a business play vital roles; smaller companies often pursue a satisfactory profit level, while larger enterprises, especially those separated from owner management, may prioritize growth for increased managerial prestige and benefits. Public-sector organizations usually don\u2019t target profit maximization due to the nature of their services which are frequently non-profit-driven like education and health. Figure 4.4 showcases a decision-making framework, with its stages from objective setting to review against objectives, implying the diverse factors that can shape business objectives.","5":"@@@Introduction to Objectives and Decision-Making in Business\nEffective decision-making requires clear objectives. Business managers cannot decide on future plans of action \u2013 strategies \u2013 if they are uncertain of which direction they want to take the business in. This essential link between decisions and objectives is illustrated in the decision-making framework model shown in Figure 4.4. The stages in this decision-making framework are: 1. Set objectives. 2. Assess the problem or situation. 3. Gather data about the problem and possible solutions. 4. Consider all decision options. 5. Make the strategic decision. 6. Plan and implement the decision. 7. Review its success against the original objectives. Clearly, without setting relevant objectives at the start of this process, effective decision-making for the future of the business becomes impossible.\n\n@@@The Evolution of Corporate Objectives\nThere are many examples of businesses changing their corporate objectives over time. These are some of the reasons for this: 1. A newly formed business may have satisfied the \u2018survival\u2019 objective by operating for several years, and now the owners wish to pursue objectives of growth or increased profit. 2. The competitive and economic environment may change, so the entry into the market of a powerful rival or the start of an economic recession may lead a firm to switch from growth to survival as its main aim \u2013 or even just to revise its objectives for sales and profits downwards. 3. A short-term objective of growth in sales or market share might be adapted to a longer-term objective of maximizing profits from the higher level of sales.\n\n@@@Factors Influencing Corporate Objectives\nSeveral factors influence the nature of the objectives established for any business. The corporate culture is a chief among these and can be defined as the code of behavior and attitudes that influence the decision-making style of the managers and other employees of the business. The size and legal form of the business also play a role, with small business owners possibly aiming for satisfactory profit or 'satisficing', while larger businesses may strive for rapid growth to increase the status and power of managers. This is often a result of the \u2018divorce between ownership and control,\u2019 which nearly always exists in large companies with professional directors who do not own it. Additionally, public-sector and private-sector businesses have different focuses, with state-owned organizations not prioritizing profit and possibly setting objectives like 'quality of service' measures. Contrastingly, businesses earning revenue in the public sector may aim to maintain services in non-profitable locations.\n\n@@@Impact of Ethical Considerations on Objectives and Decision-Making\nEthics play a significant role in shaping business objectives and decision-making. Businesses face ethical dilemmas such as whether to use aggressive marketing to children, accept bribes, support ethically controversial industries, employ environmentally-friendly practices at the expense of profits, or address issues related to pay inequality and labor conditions. The ethical code or code of conduct of a company details the mandatory behavior and guidelines that all employees must follow. The growing acceptance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) has led to more businesses considering the ethical implications of their actions in making decisions that extend beyond just profit impact.\n\n@@@Dissemination and Management of Objectives Within the Business\nCommunicating business objectives to employees is essential. If employees are unaware of the company goals, they cannot contribute efficiently to achieving them. By involving employees in the setting of objectives and clearly communicating business goals, the business is likely to benefit from enhanced employee performance through a greater understanding of both their individual and the company's collective goals. A clear objectives framework aligns employee responsibilities and facilitates monitoring and support by management. Knowledge of objectives helps employees see the bigger picture and understand their role, which is critical for the company to operate cohesively and achieve its mission. This process of cascading goals is referred to as management by objectives (MBO), wherein corporate aims are divided into specific targets at every level of the organization: aim, corporate objectives, divisional objectives, departmental objectives, and individual targets, ensuring alignment and coordination between all levels for successful achievement.","6":"@@@Introduction to Prokaryotes and the Scale of Evolution\n\n1 Cell biology explores various types of cells, including prokaryotes. The text explains that all bacterial cells are prokaryotic, indicating that bacteria fall under this category. Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms without a nucleus to contain their genetic material, and they are often smaller than eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes potentially evolved earlier than eukaryotic cells, as suggested by evolutionary evidence. With individual bacterial cells typically ranging between 1 \u00b5m and 10 \u00b5m in length, understanding the size comparison is vital; 1000 micrometres (\u00b5m) equal one millimetre (mm), translating to hundreds of bacteria that can fit within this small space. Despite their size, prokaryotes are significant in the history of life. Some scientists believe prokaryotes appeared about 3.5 billion years ago, relatively shortly after the Earth's crust formed. A visualization scale demonstrates the proportion of time various organisms, including prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, fish, land plants, and humans, have been present in the grand timeline. Key terms like \"Prokaryotic cells\" and \"Prokaryote\" are also defined for clarity.\n\n@@@Understanding Bacterial Cell Composition and Size Comparison\n\n9 A typical bacterial cell, a prokaryote, can be viewed as represented in Figure 1.4, which magnifies its structure and showcases its components. The functions of bacterial cell components such as the cytoplasm, cell wall, DNA, plasmid DNA, flagellum, cell-surface membrane, and ribosomes are highlighted in Table 1.1. Each component has a crucial role from providing cell support, enabling genetic variation, aiding in cell movement, controlling substance exchange, to facilitating respiration and protein synthesis. This section elucidates that bacterial prokaryotic cells lack mitochondria for respiration, a feature present in eukaryotic cells. Another visual representation, Figure 1.5, offers a perspective on the size of bacterial cells compared to a pinhead, underscoring the microscopic scale of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Additional tips aim to reinforce learning about cell structures while key terms like \"Chromosome,\" \"Mitochondrion,\" and \"Respiration\" are explained. Lastly, questions for self-assessment encourage readers to reflect on the unique characteristics of prokaryotic cells, the types of organisms with a single loop of DNA, differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, the role of ribosomes, and the reasoning behind the hypothesis that prokaryotic cells evolved first.","7":"@@@Introduction to Cell Biology: Understanding Animal and Plant Cells\n\nPlant and animal cells are eukaryotic, meaning they may consist of single or multiple cells and contain a nucleus, generally being larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells. A simplified animal cell structure is depicted in Figure 1.6, designed to highlight key components for easier identification. Both types of cells are explored, including a visualization of a generalised animal cell at a microscopic level, shown both three- and two-dimensionally.\n\n@@@Key Components of Animal Cells and Their Functions\n\nAnimal cells share several components with bacterial cells, as seen in the cytoplasm, which contains mainly water, ribosomes, and is the site for numerous chemical reactions, like protein synthesis. The cell-surface membrane of animal cells, which lacks a cell wall, is the outermost part of these cells and regulates the inflow and outflow of substances, such as gases and nutrients, by diffusion. Mitochondria, eukaryotic cell-specific organelles, serve as the primary sites of cellular respiration, releasing energy for vital life processes. Their high-energy demand is indicated by the abundance of mitochondria in cells that perform intense activities. In comparison, ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis, with the term 'Diffusion' being defined as the movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to one of lower concentration. The paragraph also emphasizes the uniqueness of animal cells due to their possession of nuclei and different components within the cytoplasm compared to bacterial cells.\n\n@@@Characteristics of Generalized Plant Cells\n\nLike animal cells, plant cells are also eukaryotic with a nucleus and comparatively larger than bacterial cells. Figure 1.7 illustrates a generalized plant cell under microscopic magnification, including both three-dimensional and two-dimensional representations.\n\n@@@Unique Components in Plant Cells\n\nThe structure and function of plant cells are described, highlighting the similarities they share with animal cells like possessing a nucleus with DNA, ribosomes, and mitochondria. However, plant cells also contain unique components, such as chloroplasts filled with chlorophyll, necessary for photosynthesis, through which light energy is used to create glucose and oxygen. Plant cells also exhibit cell walls made of cellulose, providing structural support essential for the plants to remain upright and capture sunlight. Photosynthesis is defined as the endothermic reaction storing energy in glucose. Additionally, plant cells often contain a large, central vacuole that helps maintain the cell's turgidity. The term 'Turgid' refers to the state of being swollen in cells.\n\n@@@Examining Plant Cells Through Practical Observation\n\nA detailed method for scrutinizing the cells of onions and pond weed under a microscope is presented, offering step-by-step procedural instructions. It concludes with a set of questions aimed at differentiating between the observed cells of the two specimens and inquiring about the organelles typically absent in animal cells. In addition to the practical tips and questions, a series of test questions are posed to reinforce learning and understanding about the structures unique to plant cells, the occurrence of mitochondria, and the roles of the cytoplasm and mitochondria. The section concludes with an explanation of why sperm cells harbor a large number of mitochondria.","8":"@@@Introduction to Cell Specialisation  \nThe previous section examined generalised animal and plant cells. However, eukaryotic organisms like humans are composed of specialised cells uniquely tailored to perform specific functions. Red blood cells are an example; their biconcave shape and the absence of a nucleus optimise their oxygen absorption. This section will detail key specialised cells in animals and plants, highlighting their particular adaptations.\n\n@@@Sperm Cell Specialization  \nDuring male ejaculation, semen containing tens of millions of sperm cells is released. These sperm cells must swim through the cervix into the fallopian tubes, where they may fertilize an egg cell. To enable this journey, sperm cells are equipped with a tail for propulsion and numerous mitochondria to release energy from glucose during respiration. This energy is essential for their persistent movement. The nucleus carries the paternal genetic material, half of what will become the offspring's DNA. At the sperm's forefront is an acrosome containing digestive enzymes that can penetrate an ovum's outer layer, facilitating fertilization (Figure 1.10).\n\n@@@Nerve Cell Function and Structure  \nThe nervous system, comprising the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), oversees both voluntary and involuntary body actions. The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord, while the PNS incorporates nerve cells that connect to the CNS and spread throughout the body. Electrical impulses travel along nerve cells, conducting vital signals. Some nerve cells have extensive axons insulated by myelin sheaths to expedite signal transmission, reflecting the importance of speed in nerve signal relay. The nerve cell body also possesses dendrites to receive signals from adjacent cells (Figure 1.11).\n\n@@@Muscle Cell Types and Adaptations  \nOur bodies have three muscle types: smooth, cardiac, and skeletal. Smooth muscle, found in the circulatory system and iris, contracts automatically, as does cardiac muscle in the heart. In contrast, skeletal muscle, usually attached to bones, is under voluntary control. Muscle cells possess abundant mitochondria to harness glucose's energy during respiration, enabling sustained contraction (Figure 1.13).\n\n@@@Root Hair Cell Structure  \nRoot hair cells extend into the soil to maximize the root's surface area in contact with the soil, allowing plants to absorb more water and minerals. The extensive network of these hair-like structures facilitates vital water uptake (Figure 1.14).\n\n@@@Xylem and Phloem Cell Functions  \nXylem cells, forming long tubes fortified with lignin fibers, transport water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant. Meanwhile, phloem cells move glucose from photosynthesis throughout the plant for immediate use or storage. Xylem tubes consist of dead cells that merge to create channels for water transmission, while phloem cells, being living, feature sieve plates to speed up sugar transport (Figures 1.15 and 1.16).\n\n@@@Cell Differentiation Process  \nAfter formation, generalized cells become specialized through cell differentiation. This occurs as an organism develops, with cells acquiring specific internal structures to perform distinct functions. For example, muscle cells contain numerous mitochondria to meet their energy demands during respiration. Notably, most plant cells retain the capacity to differentiate for their entire lifespan, a property essential for practices like taking plant cuttings (Chapter 14 to be covered later).\n\n@@@Microscopy's Historical Development  \nAlthough the exact origin of the microscope is unclear, it likely arose in the 1590s in The Netherlands among eyeglass makers. Significant advancements include Robert Hooke's usage of 'cell' in 1665 from his observations in Micrographia, and van Leeuwenhoek's later discovery of sperm cells and bacteria. These developments revolutionized scientific understanding by revealing single-celled organisms previously unknown (Figure 1.18).\n\n@@@Test Yourself and Application of Knowledge  \nTo assess comprehension, several questions prompt the reader to state the functions of nerve cells, enumerate their components, and describe red blood cells' and root hair cells' adaptations. Another task challenges the reader to explain why animals and plants possess specialized cells. A tip is provided for optimizing microscope use, highlighting the importance of this tool in cell biology.","9":"@@@Introduction to Cell Specialization\nThe previous section looked at generalized animal and plant cells. Eukaryotic organisms, like us, are not usually made of generalized cells. We have developed specialized cells that have adaptations to allow them to complete specific functions. Red blood cells, for example, have a biconcave shape (which dips in the middle on both sides) and no nucleus to maximize their surface area to absorb more oxygen. Key specialized cells for animals and plants, together with their adaptations, are listed below.\n\n@@@Sperm Cell Specialization\nIn humans, during a male orgasm about a teaspoon of semen is ejaculated. Within this are tens of millions of sperm cells, which must swim through the cervix and uterus to the fallopian tubes. Here one cell may fertilize an egg cell (ovum). Sperm cells have a tail to propel them towards the ovum (Figure 1.10). They have a relatively large number of mitochondria to release the energy from glucose during respiration. This is needed to keep them swimming. The nucleus of a human sperm contains the genetic material (DNA) of the father. This will make up half of the DNA of the baby. At the front of a sperm is an acrosome. This contains digestive enzymes, which break down the outer layer of the ovum, allowing the sperm to enter and fertilize it.\n\n@@@Nerve Cell Specialization\nOur nervous system controls and coordinates all our actions. These can be either voluntary actions (like picking up the television remote control) or involuntary actions (like our heart beating faster when we exercise). There are two main parts to our nervous system. The first is our central nervous system (CNS), which is made up of our brain and spinal cord. The other is our peripheral nervous system (PNS), which is all the other nerve cells that connect to the CNS but then spread out across the body. To control our actions, signals must be sent and received. These signals are electrical impulses that travel along nerve cells. To keep these signals moving quickly, some of our nerve cells are the longest cells in our body. Their long extensions are called axons and these have a myelin sheath surrounding much of their length (Figure 1.11). This acts like the plastic coating on an electrical wire and insulates the electrical impulse. The cell body of the nerve also has smaller extensions called dendrites, which allow it to pick up signals from neighboring cells.\n\n@@@Muscle Cell Specialization\nThere are three types of muscle in our bodies, all of which can contract and relax. Smooth muscle contracts and relaxes automatically and is found in places such as the linings of the vessels that make up our circulatory system and the iris of our eyes. Cardiac muscle also contracts and relaxes automatically and is found in our heart. The third type is skeletal muscle, which is usually found attached to our bones. We control the contractions of this type of muscle, so its movements are not automatic. All three types of muscle are made from muscle cells (Figure 1.13). These are long thin cells full of mitochondria. In the mitochondria, the energy from glucose is released during respiration. This energy allows the muscle to keep on contracting.\n\n@@@Root Hair Cell Specialization\nRoot hair cells have a small thin extension, which pokes out into the soil (Figure 1.14). Many plants have such high numbers of long root hairs that they can look like a spider's web. The purpose of these hairs is to increase the surface area of the root that is in contact with the soil. This allows the plant to absorb more water and minerals from the soil. A single rye plant has billions of root hairs, which have a total length of hundreds of miles. Without these, it is likely that the adult plant would not be able to absorb enough water to survive.","10":"@@@CELL BIOLOGY AND CELL DIFFERENTIATION\nCell biology explores the diverse functionalities and structures of cells. A crucial aspect of this field is cell differentiation, a process through which generalized cells become specialized to perform specific functions during an organism's development. This specialization allows cells to acquire unique structures that enable them to execute their designated roles efficiently. For instance, muscle cells develop numerous mitochondria to meet their high energy demands during respiration. In contrast to animal cells, which lose the ability to differentiate after a certain stage, plant cells can continue to differentiate throughout their lives, a trait essential for practices like taking plant cuttings.\n\n@@@MICROSCOPY: A HISTORICAL OVERVIEW\nThe origins of microscopy are not crystal clear, but the first microscope is thought to have been created in the 1590s by Dutch eyeglass makers. A significant leap came in 1665 when Robert Hooke\u2019s publication, \"Micrographia,\" introduced the term 'cell' after observing plant cells reminiscent of a honeycomb's cells. Later, in the mid-1670s, scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered sperm cells and bacteria, vastly expanding the understanding of single-celled organisms.\n\n@@@PRACTICAL MICROSCOPY TIPS AND COMPONENTS OF LIGHT MICROSCOPES\nModern microscopes may look different from the early iterations used by Hooke and van Leeuwenhoek, but the commonality lies in their use of magnifying lenses. A light microscope has several key parts highlighted in Table 1.2. The eyepiece lens and objective lenses of varying magnification, stage, specimen placement, lighting mirrors, and focus adjustments all play fundamental roles in the microscopy process. The total magnification of an observed sample is determined by multiplying the magnifications of the eyepiece and objective lenses.\n\n@@@ADVANCEMENTS IN MICROSCOPY: ELECTRON MICROSCOPES\nThe development of electron microscopes, initiated by Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll's transmission electron microscope (TEM) in 1931, marked a significant progress in microscopic technology. Later, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) by Manfred von Ardenne allowed for detailed three-dimensional imaging. Electron microscopes operate using beams of electrons resulting in much higher magnification and resolution compared to light microscopes. The TEM provides flat, cross-sectional images, while the SEM delivers more three-dimensional representations. Despite their monochromatic output, electron microscope images are sometimes colorized for visual impact. The concept of resolution, the smallest distinguishable distance between two points, is substantially enhanced in electron microscopes, achieving separation of as little as 0.1 nm compared to the 200 nm resolution limit of light microscopes.","11":"@@@INTRODUCTION TO EUKARYOTIC CELLS: AN OVERVIEW OF ANIMAL AND PLANT CELLS\nPlant and animal cells are eukaryotic. They can be unicellular or belong to multicellular organisms. Eukaryotic cells almost always have a nucleus and are generally larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells. The structure of a generalised animal cell is shown in Figure 1.6. A generalised cell is one that has been simplified to make the key components easier to identify.\n\u25b2 Figure 1.6 A generalised animal cell as seen with a microscope (magnified \u00d74800) and as three- and two-dimensional diagrams.\n\n@@@COMPONENTS OF ANIMAL CELLS: UNDERSTANDING THEIR FUNCTION AND STRUCTURE\nIn the previous section, we looked at bacterial cells. Animal cells have many components in common with these. The cytoplasm of animal cells is also mainly water and it holds other components such as ribosomes. In the cytoplasm, most of the chemical reactions in the cell happen (such as the making of proteins in ribosomes). The cell-surface membrane of animal cells also surrounds the cell. There are no cell walls in animal cells and so the membrane is on the outside of these cells. The membrane controls what substances go in and out of the cell. Many cells need glucose and oxygen for respiration, and these substances move by diffusion into the cell from the blood, where it is found at a higher concentration. Carbon dioxide moves back into the blood capillaries through the membrane. Mitochondria are small organelles found in the cytoplasm and are only present in eukaryotic cells. They are the site of most of a cell\u2019s respiration. Here the energy stored in glucose is released for the cell to complete the seven life processes. Without this energy, all cells die. More-active cells such as those in muscles or sperm cells usually have more mitochondria because these cells need more energy. Mitochondria have many folds inside them, which make their surface area very large to increase the rate at which energy is released. Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. These organelles are present in the cytoplasm of animal cells. \n\nKEy TERM\nDiffusion The net movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of lower concentration.\n\nnucleus cell surface membrane cytoplasm mitochondria ribosomes\n\n@@@UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF ANIMAL CELLS: THE CENTRAL ROLE OF THE NUCLEUS\nAnimal cells are unlike bacterial cells in that they usually possess a nucleus. This component is present in almost all eukaryotic cells. It is found in the cytoplasm and is surrounded by its own membrane. The cell\u2019s genetic material (DNA) is enclosed within it, arranged into shapes called chromosomes. (Red blood cells do not have a nucleus, so they have more room to absorb and carry the maximum amount of oxygen, which is their main function.) Humans are, of course, classified as animals. Many of our cells are like other animal cells.\n\n@@@GENERAL STRUCTURE OF PLANT CELLS: COMPARISON WITH ANIMAL CELLS\nLike those belonging to animals, plant cells are eukaryotic. This means that they may belong to single-celled or multicellular organisms, they do have a nucleus and they are generally larger than prokaryotic (bacterial) cells.\n\u25b2 Figure 1.7 A generalised plant cell as seen with a microscope (magnified \u00d72800) and as three- and two-dimensional diagrams.\n\n@@@DISTINCTIVE COMPONENTS OF PLANT CELLS: CHLOROPLASTS AND CELL WALLS\nPlant cells have many components in common with animal cells, including a nucleus in which the organism\u2019s genetic material (DNA) is found. Plant cells also possess ribosomes for protein synthesis and mitochondria for respiration in their cytoplasm. Plant cells possess some components not present in animal cells. Chloroplasts are small components, full of a green pigment called chlorophyll which is necessary for photosynthesis to occur. This reaction uses light energy from the Sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, and so provides an energy source for the plant. It is the green chlorophyll in plants that gives some of their parts their green color. Most roots are hidden from the Sun and so cannot photosynthesize. They do not have chloroplasts and so are often white, not green. There are huge numbers of chloroplasts in leaf cells. There are often well over half a million per square millimeter of leaf. Plant cells also possess a cell wall, unlike animal cells. This is made from cellulose and provides structure for the cell. Plants would not be able to stand upright to catch light energy from the Sun without cell walls. The cell surface membrane is found inside the cell wall.\n\nKEy TERM\nPhotosynthesis An endothermic reaction that occurs in the chloroplasts of plants and algae and stores energy in glucose.\n\nmitochondria nucleus cell surface membrane cell wall chloroplasts vacuole cytoplasm ribosomes\n\n\u25b2 Figure 1.8 The structure of a chloroplast (magnification about \u00d715,000).","12":"@@@Overview of Eukaryotic Cells and Their Differentiation from Prokaryotic Cells\nThere are two types of cell \u2014 prokaryotic and eukaryotic. The next few pages are about eukaryotic cells and their organelles (all the tiny bits and bobs that you can only see in detail with a fancy microscope). Organisms can be Prokaryotes or Eukaryotes. 1) Prokaryotic organisms are prokaryotic cells (i.e., they're single-celled organisms) and eukaryotic organisms are made up of eukaryotic cells. 2) Both types of cells contain organelles, which are parts of cells\u2014 each one has a specific function. Eukaryotic cells are complex and include all animal and plant cells, as well as all cells in algae and fungi. Prokaryotic cells are smaller and simpler, for example, bacteria. See page 28 for more.\n\n@@@Distinctive Features of Animal and Plant Cells\nYou Need to Know the Structure of Eukaryotic Cells: Eukaryotic cells are generally a bit more complicated than prokaryotic cells. You've probably been looking at animal and plant cell diagrams for years, so hopefully you'll be familiar with some of the bits and pieces. Animal cells have a plasma (cell surface) membrane, rough endoplasmic reticulum, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasm, and mitochondrion. Plant cells have all the same organelles as animal cells but with a few added extras: a cellulose cell wall with plasmodesmata ('channels' for exchanging substances with adjacent cells), a vacuole (compartment that contains cell sap), and of course good old chloroplasts. You might also see starch grains in plant cells, although they're not organelles. Plants use starch grains to store excess sugars.\n\n@@@Characteristics of Algal and Fungal Cells\nAlgal and Fungal Cells: 1) Algal cells are a lot like plant cells \u2014 they have all the same organelles, including a cell wall and chloroplasts. 2) Fungal cells are also a lot like plant cells, but with two key differences: their cell walls are made of chitin, not cellulose, and they don't have chloroplasts because they don't photosynthesize. Algae carry out photosynthesis, like plants, but can be single-celled or multicellular. Fungi include mushrooms and yeast.\n\n@@@Organelles and Their Functions in Eukaryotic Cells\nDifferent Organelles have Different Functions: This giant table contains a big list of organelles \u2014 you need to know the structure and function of them all. Sorry. Most organelles are surrounded by membranes, which sometimes causes confusion \u2014 don't make the mistake of thinking that a diagram of an organelle is a diagram of a whole cell. They're not cells \u2014 they're parts of cells. ORGANELLE DIAGRAM DESCRIPTION FUNCTION: \n\nCell-surface (Plasma) Membrane\u2014Regulates the movement of substances into and out of the cell and has receptor molecules for responding to chemicals like hormones. \n\nNucleus\u2014Controls the cell's activities (by controlling the transcription of DNA) and is where the nucleolus makes ribosomes. \n\nMitochondrion\u2014The site of aerobic respiration, where ATP is produced. \n\nChloroplast\u2014The site where photosynthesis takes place in plant and algal cells. \n\nGolgi Apparatus\u2014Processes and packages new lipids and proteins and makes lysosomes.\n\nGolgi Vesicle\u2014Stores lipids and proteins made by the Golgi apparatus and transports them out of the cell. \n\nLysosome\u2014Contains digestive enzymes for breaking down invading cells or worn-out cell components. \n\nRibosome\u2014The site where proteins are made. \n\nRough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER)\u2014Folds and processes proteins made at the ribosomes. \n\nSmooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER)\u2014Synthesises and processes lipids. \n\nCell Wall\u2014Supports cells in plants, algae, and fungi and prevents them from changing shape. \n\nCell Vacuole\u2014Helps maintain pressure inside plant cells, keeping them rigid, and isolates unwanted chemicals.\n\n(End of the given text, for further details and the full list of organelle functions, see the original table provided in the learning materials)","13":"@@@INTRODUCTION TO BIOLOGICAL MOLECULES AND CARBOHYDRATES\nThe topic of IA focuses on Biological Molecules, emphasizing that all organisms, despite their differences, share some biochemical characteristics. These include various carbon-based compounds that behave in comparable manners. Part of this shared biochemistry involves carbohydrates, which, alongside proteins and nucleic acids, are generally polymers. Polymers are large, complex molecules made up of long chains of monomers, which are small, basic molecular units. Examples of monomers include monosaccharides (simple sugars like glucose, fructose, and galactose), amino acids, and nucleotides.\n\n@@@STRUCTURE OF CARBOHYDRATES\nCarbohydrates are composed of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O), and their fundamental building blocks are monosaccharides. Specifically, glucose is highlighted as a hexose sugar, meaning it contains six carbon atoms. Two structural variants of glucose, alpha-glucose and beta-glucose, are mentioned as isomers \u2014 compounds with the same formula but different structural arrangements. These two forms have a key structural difference that students need to recognize for their examinations.\n\n@@@FORMATION OF DISACCHARIDES THROUGH CONDENSATION REACTIONS\nMonosaccharides combine through condensation reactions, which result in the formation of new chemical bonds and the release of water molecules. Glycosidic bonds are the type of bonds that form between monosaccharides during this process. When two alpha-glucose molecules join, they create maltose, a disaccharide, through such a reaction. Examples of other disaccharides include sucrose, made from glucose and fructose, and lactose, made from glucose and galactose.\n\n@@@BREAKDOWN OF POLYMERS VIA HYDROLYSIS REACTIONS\nIn contrast to the synthesis seen in condensation reactions, hydrolysis reactions involve the breakdown of polymers into monomers using water molecules. This process, essentially the reverse of condensation, is key to decomposing carbohydrates into their monosaccharide components.\n\n@@@IDENTIFICATION OF SUGARS USING THE BENEDICT\u2019S TEST\nThe Benedict's test is a method used to identify reducing sugars, which include monosaccharides and some disaccharides like maltose and lactose. The test involves adding a blue Benedict's reagent to the sample and then heating it. If reducing sugars are present, a color change in the solution will occur, ranging from green to brick red, depending on the concentration of the sugar. For non-reducing sugars, additional steps involving acid hydrolysis are required before performing the Benedict's test.\n\n@@@POLYSACCHARIDES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS\nAfter discussing monosaccharides and disaccharides, the focus shifts to polysaccharides, complex carbohydrates formed from more than two monosaccharides. Starch, a primary energy storage material in plants, is comprised of amylose and amylopectin \u2014 both polymers of alpha-glucose but with distinct structural properties. An iodine test can be used to identify the presence of starch. Animals store excess glucose as glycogen, a polysaccharide similar to amylopectin but with more extensive branching, allowing for a rapid release of glucose as needed for energy.","14":"@@@Overview of Eukaryotic Cells and Classification of Organisms\nThere are two types of cell \u2014 prokaryotic and eukaryotic.

This giant table contains a big list of organelles \u2014 you need to know the structure and function of them all. Most organelles are surrounded by membranes, which sometimes causes confusion \u2014 don't make the mistake of thinking that a diagram of an organelle is a diagram of a whole cell. They're not cells \u2014 they're parts of cells. The Cell-surface (Plasma) Membrane regulates the movement of substances into and out of the cell. The nucleus controls the cell's activities (by controlling the transcription of DNA \u2014 see page 84). The mitochondrion is the site of aerobic respiration, where ATP is produced. In plant and algal cells, the chloroplast is where photosynthesis takes place. The Golgi apparatus processes and packages new lipids and proteins and makes lysosomes.\n\n@@@Cell Specialization and Organization in Multicellular Organisms\nThe Organelles in Specialised Cells Vary. In multicellular eukaryotic organisms, cells become specialised to carry out specific functions. A cell's structure (i.e. its shape and the organelles it contains) helps it to carry out its function. Specialised cells are organised into tissues, organs, and organ systems. An example is epithelial cells in the small intestine which have lots of mitochondria \u2014 to provide energy for the transport of digested food molecules into the cell. Epithelial cells are grouped into epithelial tissue, and with muscular and glandular tissue, form the stomach as an organ, part of the digestive system, an organ system.\n\n@@@Revision Questions and Contextual Application of Knowledge\nPractice Questions and Exam Questions are provided to test knowledge and understanding related to the topics of cell structure and organelle function. Questions include ones asking about the composition of plant and fungal cell walls, functions of mitochondria and ribosomes, differences between various endoplasmic reticula, and the structure of specialised cells such as ciliated epithelial cells or pancreatic cells. Organelles are crucial and repeatedly show up throughout the chapter, ensuring that understanding their role is essential for grasping further biological concepts.","15":"@@@Analysis of Cell Components\nYou can use microscopes to look at all the lovely organelles you've been learning about. \n\n@@@Magnification and Resolution in Microscopy\nMagnification is Size, Resolution is Detail. We all know that microscopes produce a magnified image of a sample, but resolution is just as important.\n\n@@@Types of Microscopes: Optical\nThere are Two Main Types of Microscope \u2014 Optical and Electron. Optical (light) microscopes use light to form an image. They have a maximum resolution of about 0.2 micrometres (\u00b5m). This means you can't use an optical microscope to view organelles smaller than 0.2 \u00b5m. That includes ribosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, and lysosomes. You may be able to make out mitochondria \u2014 but not in perfect detail. You can also see the nucleus. The maximum useful magnification of an optical microscope is about x 1500.\n\n@@@Types of Microscopes: Electron\nElectron microscopes use electrons to form an image. They have a higher resolution than optical microscopes so give a more detailed image (and can be used to look at more organelles). They have a maximum resolution of about 0.0002 micrometres (\u00b5m). (About 1000 times higher than optical microscopes.) The maximum useful magnification of an electron microscope is about x 1,500,000. A micrometre (\u00b5m) is three - orders of magnitude smaller than a millimetre (1 \u00b5m = 0.001 mm). To convert from \u00b5m to mm, divide by 1000. Technological advancements have led to the development of different types of electron microscopes.\n\n@@@Electron Microscopes: Transmission and Scanning\nElectron Microscopes are either Scanning or Transmission. Transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) use electromagnets to focus a beam of electrons, which is then transmitted through the specimen. Denser parts of the specimen absorb more electrons, which makes them look darker on the image you end up with. TEMs give high-resolution images, so you can see the internal structure of organelles like chloroplasts. However, they can only be used on thin specimens. Scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) scan a beam of electrons across the specimen. This knocks off electrons from the specimen, which are gathered in a cathode ray tube to form an image. The images show the surface of the specimen, and they can be 3-D. SEMs can be used on thick specimens but give lower resolution images than TEMs.\n\n@@@Preparation of Specimens for Optical Microscopy\nYou View Specimens Under an Optical Microscope Using Slides. Here's how to prepare a 'temporary mount' of a specimen on a slide: Start by pipetting a small drop of water onto the slide (a strip of clear glass or plastic). Then use tweezers to place a thin section of your specimen on top of the water drop. Add a drop of a stain. Stains are used to highlight objects in a cell. For example, eosin is used to make the cytoplasm show up. Iodine in potassium iodide solution is used to stain starch grains in plant cells. Finally, add the cover slip (a square of clear plastic that protects the specimen). To do so, stand the slip upright on the slide, next to the water droplet. Then carefully tilt and lower it so it covers the specimen. Try not to get any air bubbles under there \u2014 they'll obstruct your view of the specimen.\n\n@@@Topic Overview\nTopic 2A \u2014 Cell Structure and Division","16":"@@@Analysis of Cell Components: Cell Fractionation Separates Organelles\n\nSuppose you wanted to look at some organelles under an electron microscope. First, you'd need to separate them from the rest of the cell \u2014 you can do this by cell fractionation. There are three steps to this technique: (1) Homogenisation \u2014 Breaking Up the Cells - Homogenisation can be done in several different ways, e.g., by vibrating the cells or by grinding the cells up in a blender. This breaks up the plasma membrane and releases the organelles into solution. The solution must be kept ice-cold, to reduce the activity of enzymes that break down organelles. The solution should also be isotonic \u2014 this means it should have the same concentration of chemicals as the cells being broken down, to prevent damage to the organelles through osmosis. A buffer solution should be added to maintain the pH. (2) Filtration \u2014 Getting Rid of the Big Bits - Next, the homogenised cell solution is filtered through a gauze to separate any large cell debris or tissue debris, like connective tissue, from the organelles. The organelles are much smaller than the debris, so they pass through the gauze. (3) Ultracentrifugation \u2014 Separating the Organelles - After filtration, you're left with a solution containing a mixture of organelles. To separate a particular organelle from all the others you use ultracentrifugation.\n\nThe process of ultracentrifugation involves the following steps: (1) The cell fragments are poured into a tube. The tube is put into a centrifuge and is spun at a low speed. The heaviest organelles, like nuclei, get flung to the bottom of the tube by the centrifuge. They form a thick sediment at the bottom \u2014 the pellet. The rest of the organelles stay suspended in the fluid above the sediment \u2014 the supernatant. (2) The supernatant is drained off, poured into another tube, and spun in the centrifuge at a higher speed. Again, the heaviest organelle, this time the mitochondria, forms a pellet at the bottom of the tube. The supernatant containing the rest of the organelles is drained off and spun in the centrifuge at an even higher speed. (3) This process is repeated at higher and higher speeds, until all the organelles are separated out. Each time, the pellet at the bottom of the tube is made up of lighter and lighter organelles. Organelles are separated in the following order of mass (from heaviest to lightest): nuclei, mitochondria, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and finally ribosomes. There is also a humorous note relating to the experience of centrifugation and a visual depiction of an endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, lysosomes, mitochondria, and nuclei separated in the order of their mass. For clarity in experiments, if interested in observing mitochondria specifically, it's suggested to homogenise, filter, and ultracentrifuge first, and then decide whether to use a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) or Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), taking into account their limitations.\n\n@@@Cell Division \u2014 Investigating Mitosis\n\nIt's time to dust off your lab coat and get out your safety specs. Here are all the techniques you need to study mitosis. You'll need to know how to stain root cells on slides and how to use an optical microscope and graticules. Root Tips Can be Stained and Squashed to Observe Mitosis - To observe the stages of mitosis, you need to prepare and stain a root tip. Safety gear includes goggles, a lab coat, and gloves when using stains. The steps for this process are:\n\n(1) Cut 1 cm from the tip of a growing root.\n(2) If using ethano-orcein to stain, the tips also need to be fixed in ethanoic acid.\n(3) Prepare a boiling tube with 1 M hydrochloric acid set in a water bath at 60\u00b0C, and incubate the root tip in it for about 5 minutes.\n(4) Rinse the root tip well with cold water and leave it to dry.\n(5) Place the tip on a microscope slide and cut 2 mm from the very tip. Discard the rest.\n(6) Break the tip open and spread the cells thinly.\n(7) Add a few drops of stain and leave it for a few minutes.\n(8) If using Feulgen stain, an extra rinse is needed.\n(9) Place a cover slip on top and squash the cells to thin the tissue enabling light passage.\n\nDifferent stains are available, such as toluidine blue O, ethano-orcein, and Feulgen, each making chromosomes easier to see. Avoid smearing the cover slip to prevent damage. You can then observe cells in different stages of mitosis under an optical microscope.\n\nYou Can Observe Cells Using an Optical Microscope - Using an optical microscope involves the following steps:\n\n(1) Clip the prepared slide onto the stage.\n(2) Select the lowest-powered objective lens.\n(3) Use the coarse adjustment knob to bring the stage close to the objective lens.\n(4) Look down the eyepiece and adjust the stage position with the coarse knob to bring the image into rough focus.\n(5) Use the fine adjustment knob for a clear image.\n(6) For greater magnification, swap to a higher-powered lens and refocus.\n\nIt's important to note magnification and label drawings when recording mitotic cells. The Mitotic Index and its significance in determining tissue growth and abnormalities are discussed, with a formula provided for its calculation: mitotic index = (number of cells with visible chromosomes) \/ (total number of cells observed). A high mitotic index in plant root tips indicates active growth, whereas in other tissue samples, it may suggest tissue repair or cancerous growth.","17":"@@@Investigating Mitosis: Preparation and Observation Techniques\nIt's time to dust off your lab coat and get out your safety specs. Here are all the techniques you need to study mitosis. You'll need to know how to stain root cells on slides and how to use an optical microscope and graticules. Root Tips Can be Stained and Squashed to Observe Mitosis You need to know how to prepare and stain a root tip in order to observe the stages of mitosis. Make sure you're wearing safety goggles and a lab coat before you start. You should also wear gloves when using stains. 1) Cut 1 cm from the tip from a growing root (e.g. of an onion). It needs to be the tip because that's where growth occurs (and so that's where mitosis takes place). 2) If you're using ethano-orcein to stain the cells, the tips will also need to be fixed in ethanoic acid. 3) Prepare a boiling tube containing 1 M hydrochloric acid and put it in a water bath at 60 \u00b0C. Transfer the root tip into the boiling tube and incubate for about 5 minutes. 4) Use a pipette to rinse the root tip well with cold water. Leave the tip to dry on a paper towel. 5) Place the root tip on a microscope slide and cut 2 mm from the very tip of it. Get rid of the rest. 6) Use a mounted needle to break the tip open and spread the cells out thinly. 7) Add a few drops of stain and leave it for a few minutes. The stain will make the chromosomes easier to see under a microscope. There are loads of different stains, all with crazy names (toluidine blue O, ethano-orcein, Feulgen stain... 8) If you're using the Feulgen stain, you'll need an extra rinse. 9) Place a cover slip over the cells and push down firmly to squash the tissue. This will make the tissue thinner and allow light to pass through it. Don't smear the cover slip sideways (or you'll damage the chromosomes). Now you can look at all the stages of mitosis under an optical microscope (see below). You should see something that looks like the photograph on the right. Prophase Anaphase Metaphase Interphase HERVE CONGE. ISM\/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY - You need to be able to recognise cells in the different stages of mitosis \u2014 see p. 32 for more info.\n\n@@@Utilizing an Optical Microscope to Study Mitotic Cells\nYou Can Observe Cells Using an Optical Microscope You need to know how to use an optical microscope to observe your prepared root tip cells: 1) Start by clipping the slide you've prepared onto the stage. 2) Select the lowest-powered objective lens (i.e. the one that produces the lowest magnification). 3) Use the coarse adjustment knob to bring the stage up to just below the objective lens. 4) Look down the eyepiece (which contains the ocular lens). Use the coarse adjustment knob to move the stage downwards, away from the objective lens until the image is roughly in focus. 5) Adjust the focus with the fine adjustment knob, until you get a clear image of what's on the slide. 6) If you need to see the slide with greater magnification, swap to a higher-powered objective lens and refocus. If you're asked to draw cells undergoing mitosis under the microscope, make sure you write down the magnification the specimen was viewed under. You'll also need to label your drawing.\n\n@@@Calculating the Mitotic Index\nThe Mitotic Index Is the Proportion of Cells Undergoing Mitosis You can calculate the mitotic index of your cells using this formula: mitotic index = number of cells with visible chromosomes \/ total number of cells observed This lets you work out how quickly the tissue is growing and if there's anything weird going on. A plant root tip is constantly growing, so you'd expect a high mitotic index (i.e. lots of cells in mitosis). In other tissue samples, a high mitotic index could mean that tissue repair is taking place or that there is cancerous growth in the tissue.\n\n@@@Measuring Cell Size with Graticules and Micrometers\nYou Can Use A Graticule and Micrometer to Calculate the Size of Cells... 1) You need to be able to calculate the size of the cells you're looking at. That's where the eyepiece graticule and stage micrometer come in \u2014 they're a bit like rulers. 2) An eyepiece graticule is fitted onto the eyepiece. It's like a transparent ruler with numbers, but no units. 3) The stage micrometer is placed on the stage \u2014 it is a microscope slide with an accurate scale (it has units) and it's used to work out the value of the divisions on the eyepiece graticule at a particular magnification. 4) This means that when you take the stage micrometer away and replace it with the slide containing your tissue sample, you'll be able to measure the size of the cells. Here's an example: 4.5 eyepiece divisions = 1 stage division. Line up the eyepiece graticule and the stage micrometer. Each division on the stage micrometer is 0.1 mm long. At this magnification, 1 division on the stage micrometer is the same as 4.5 divisions on the eyepiece graticule. To work out the size of 1 division on the eyepiece graticule, you need to divide 0.1 by 4.5: 1 division on eyepiece graticule = 0.1 \/ 4.5 = 0.022 mm So if you look at a cell under the microscope at this magnification and it\u2019s 4 eyepiece divisions long, you know it measures: 4 x 0.022 = 0.088 mm. The eyepiece graticule will need to be re-calibrated at different magnifications. If you're given an image of cells under the microscope in the exam, you can calculate their actual size using this formula: Example: If the image of a cell measures 5 mm and the magnification is x 100, then the actual size of the cell will be: 5 \/ 100 = 0.05 mm. actual size = size of image \/ magnification\n\n@@@Understanding Microscopy Artefacts\nArtefacts Can Get in the Way of Your Observations 1) Artefacts are things that you can see down the microscope that aren't part of the cell or specimen that you're looking at. 2) They can be anything from bits of dust, air bubbles and fingerprints, to inaccuracies caused by crushing and staining your sample. 3) Artefacts are usually made during the preparation of your slides and shouldn't really be there at all \u2014 you'll need to prepare your root tip cells carefully to avoid creating artefacts. Artefacts are especially common in electron micrographs because specimens need a lot of preparation before you can view them under an electron microscope. The first scientists to use these microscopes could only distinguish between artefacts and organelles by repeatedly preparing specimens in different ways. If an object could be seen with one preparation technique, but not another, it was more likely to be an artefact than an organelle.\n\n@@@Practice Questions on Cell Division and Mitosis\nPractice Questions Q1 Why do you need to squash the tissue when preparing a slide of plant root tip cells? Exam Question Q1 A sample of cells was prepared to observe mitosis. In total, 42 cells were observed. 32 of those had visible chromosomes. Calculate the mitotic index for this sample. Give your answer to 2 decimal places. [2 marks] \u2018Staining your samples\u2019 \u2014 a common problem at the start of exams... Wow \u2014 I bet you never realised there was so much to know about using a microscope. Still, staining is pretty straightforward and so's preparing a slide. Using a graticule is tricky, but once you get your head round it you'll be fine.","18":"@@@Introduction to Cell Membrane Structure\nYou might remember a bit about cell membranes from p. 25. Well now it's time to delve a little deeper into their structure and functionality. All cells are surrounded by cell membranes, and in eukaryotic cells, many of the organelles are also enclosed by membranes.\n\n@@@Functions of the Cell Membrane\nCell-surface membranes serve as barriers between the cell and its external environment, controlling which substances can enter and leave the cell. They are selectively permeable, allowing some molecules to pass through by diffusion, osmosis, or active transport, while restricting others. Similarly, membranes around organelles segregate the cell into different compartments, maintaining a boundary between the organelle and the cytoplasm, and controlling substance exchange within the cell.\n\n@@@Structure of Cell Membranes: The Fluid Mosaic Model\nThe basic structure of cell membranes, primarily composed of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates, is consistent across all cell types. The fluid mosaic model proposed in 1972 is a widely accepted description of the membrane's organization, where the phospholipid molecules form a double layer that is fluid due to constant movement amongst the molecules. Embedded within this bilayer are cholesterol molecules, various proteins\u2014including channel and carrier proteins that facilitate transport, and receptor proteins for cell signaling\u2014and glycoproteins which aid in cell recognition and interaction.\n\n@@@Functional Roles of Membrane Components\nEach component of the cell membrane serves a unique purpose. Phospholipids organize into a bilayer with hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails, forming a barrier to water-soluble substances. Cholesterol, another lipid component, contributes to membrane stability by fitting snugly between phospholipid molecules, making the membrane less fluid and more structured. This stability is especially critical in animal cells, which lack supporting cell walls.\n\n@@@Investigating Membrane Permeability in the Laboratory\nThe permeability of cell membranes is influenced by environmental factors like temperature and solvent concentration. A laboratory method to examine this involves using beetroot pieces, where pigment leakage indicates membrane permeability. By varying the temperature or solvent exposure, one can monitor the color intensity in the solution to gauge the permeability changes.\n\n@@@The Influence of Temperature on Membrane Permeability\nMembrane permeability is temperature-dependent. Below 0 \u00b0C, phospholipids are closely packed, rendering the membrane rigid. However, this also leads to deformation of proteins within the membrane, increasing permeability. Between 0 and 45 \u00b0C, the membrane is semi-permeable, with increasing temperature causing phospholipids to move more, thereby increasing permeability. Above 45 \u00b0C, the bilayer begins to break down, pressure builds within the cell, and proteins deform, dramatically increasing membrane permeability.\n\n@@@Examining the Fluid Mosaic Model\nThe fluid mosaic model is an interesting concept that describes the dynamic nature of cell membranes. This model is crucial because it explains the cell's capacity to alter shape and adapt without bursting due to rigidity. The membrane's fluidity is fundamental to the cell's mechanical stability and functionality.","19":"@@@Exchange Across Cell Membranes \u2014 Diffusion: Understanding the Passive Movement of Particles\nExchange Across Cell Membranes through Diffusion begins to unravel the seemingly complex process of how some substances cross cell membranes without expending energy\u2014an excitement for those keen on cellular processes. A depth exploration of diffusion, the passive movement of particles, unfolds thusly:\n1) Diffusion is the process where particles (molecules or ions) move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration naturally, aiming to reach an equilibrium.\n2) Molecules move in both directions, but there is a net movement towards the area of lower concentration, which continues until an even distribution is achieved within the liquid or gas.\n3) This movement path\u2014from higher to lower concentration\u2014is termed the concentration gradient. Movement along this gradient is known as traveling \"down\" the concentration gradient.\n4) Diffusion is passive, requiring no energy to occur.\n5) For particles to diffuse across cell membranes, they must freely traverse the membrane.\n\nThe ability of molecules to pass through the cell membrane depends on their characteristics. Polar molecules, with partial positive and negative charges, differ from non-polar molecules that do not carry the same charge distinctions. For example, molecules like oxygen and carbon dioxide can diffuse with ease through cell membranes because of their petite size, allowing passage between phospholipids, and their non-polar nature, enabling them to dissolve in the hydrophobic bilayer.\n\n@@@Facilitated Diffusion: The Role of Carrier Proteins and Protein Channels in Membrane Transport\nSometimes, molecules require assistance to diffuse expeditiously across cell membranes. This section elucidates Facilitated Diffusion, the diffusion process for large or charged particles.\n1) Large molecules, such as amino acids and glucose, would move sluggishly through the phospholipid bilayer due to their size.\n2) Charged particles, including ions and polar molecules, would also diffuse at a slow pace given their water solubility and the bilayer's hydrophobic center.\n3) Thus, to expedite the process, these larger or charged particles diffuse through carrier proteins or channel proteins present in the membrane, a process known as facilitated diffusion.\n4) Facilitated diffusion, mirroring diffusion, moves particles down a concentration gradient without energy usage.\n\nCarrier proteins work by attaching to a large molecule first, then altering their shape to release the molecule to the other side of the membrane, obeying the concentration gradient.\n\nChannel proteins provide another facilitated diffusion pathway, creating pores in the membrane for charged particles to diffuse through, based on their concentration gradient, with each protein catering to different charged particles.\n\n@@@The Rate of Diffusion: Factors Influencing Particle Movement Across Cell Membranes\nThis section examines the factors impacting the rate of diffusion, from concentration gradients to membrane adaptions for rapid transport.\n1) The concentration gradient significantly affects the rate of diffusion; the higher it is, the quicker diffusion occurs, though the rate decreases as equilibrium gets closer.\n2) The exchange surface's thinness is also critical\u2014the thinner it is, the more rapid the diffusion, as the distance traveled by the particles is reduced.\n3) A larger surface area, such as that of the cell-surface membrane, provides a faster diffusion rate.\n\nMicrovilli, for example, increase the surface area available for diffusion, as seen in epithelial cells within the small intestine. These microvilli can substantially increase a cell's surface area, thus boosting the diffusion rate.\n\nTo distinguish, simple diffusion relies on the concentration gradient, while facilitated diffusion not only relies on it but also on the availability and quantity of channel or carrier proteins present. The presence of more proteins equates to a faster facilitated diffusion rate. Special channel proteins like aquaporins illustrate the function by enabling water to diffuse through cell membranes efficiently.\n\nTesting knowledge on diffusion can appear in exams where one might be asked to calculate diffusion rates from graphs, which could involve finding a line's gradient or drawing tangents.\n\n@@@Practice and Exam Questions on Diffusion and Rate Factors\nFinally, to solidify understanding, a set of practice questions challenges the learner's comprehension of passive diffusion and the role of microvilli. Additionally, an exam question calls for detailed knowledge involving facilitated diffusion of chloride ions, including the molecules involved, why simple diffusion is inefficient, and the implications over time. Through these inquiries, students get to delve deeper into the workings of molecules that endlessly move without growing weary, painting a picture of cellular functionality where small molecules like oxygen resort to simple diffusion, and large or charged molecules get a boost from channel or carrier proteins. All the while, this sets the stage for the upcoming topic of active transport.","20":"@@@Understanding Osmosis: The Diffusion of Water Molecules Across Cell Membranes\nThese two pages are entirely about the movement of water molecules. If you've mastered diffusion (see pages 38-39), you'll nail this lot in no time. Osmosis is Diffusion of Water Molecules. Osmosis is the diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane, from an area of higher water potential (i.e., higher concentration of water molecules) to an area of lower water potential (i.e., lower concentration of water molecules). Water potential is the potential (likelihood) of water molecules to diffuse out of or into a solution. Pure water has the highest water potential. All solutions have a lower water potential than pure water. If two solutions have the same water potential, they're said to be isotonic. LOWER water potential net movement of water molecules. OUT. IN Higher water potential water molecules diffuse both ways membrane. Water molecule. The Rate of Osmosis Depends on Several Factors. The factors affecting the rate of osmosis are similar to those affecting the rate of diffusion (see previous page). \n\n1) The water potential gradient \u2014 the higher the water potential gradient, the faster the rate of osmosis. As osmosis takes place, the difference in water potential on either side of the membrane decreases, so the rate of osmosis levels off over time.\n\n2) The thickness of the exchange surface \u2014 the thinner the exchange surface, the faster the rate of osmosis. \n\n3) The surface area of the exchange surface \u2014 the larger the surface area, the faster the rate of osmosis.\n\n@@@Osmosis: Practical Experiments and Water Potential Insights\nYou can do Experiments to Investigate Water Potential using Serial Dilutions. You can do a simple experiment, using potato cylinders, to find out the water potential of plant tissue (see next page). First though, you need to make up several solutions of different, known concentrations to test the cylinders in. You can do this using a serial dilution technique: \n\nThis is how you'd make five serial dilutions of a sucrose solution, starting with an initial sucrose concentration of 2 M and diluting each solution by a factor of 2... Line up five test tubes in a rack. You don't have to dilute solutions by a factor of 2. For example, to dilute by a factor of 10, take 1 cm3 from your original sample and add it to 9 cm3 of water. Transfer 5 cm3. Add 10 cm3 of the initial 2 M sucrose solution to the first test tube and 5 cm3 of distilled water to the other four test tubes. Then, using a pipette, draw 5 cm3 of the solution from the first test tube, add it to the distilled water in the second test tube and mix the solution thoroughly. You now have 10 cm3 of solution that's half as concentrated as the solution in the first test tube (it's 1 M). Repeat this process three more times to create solutions of 0.5 M, 0.25 M, and 0.125 M. \n\n@@@Advanced Techniques in Osmosis: Using Scale Factors to Prepare Solutions\nYou Can Also Make Solutions of Different Concentrations By Finding the Scale Factor. You can make sucrose solutions of any concentration by finding the scale factor. For example, if you want to make 15 cm3 of 0.4 M sucrose solution...\n\n1) Start with a solution of a known concentration, e.g. 1 M. \n\n2) Find the scale factor by dividing the concentration of this solution by the concentration of the solution you want to make. So in this case, the scale factor = 1 M \/ 0.4 M = 2.5. \n\n3) This means that the solution you want to make is 2.5 times weaker than the one you have. To make the solution 2.5 times weaker, use 2.5 times less of it, i.e., 15 cm3 \/ 2.5 = 6 cm3. Transfer this amount to a clean test tube. \n\n4) Top up the test tube with distilled water to get the volume you want to make. In this case, you want to make 15 cm3 of solution, so you need to add: 15 - 6 = 9 cm3 of distilled water.\n\n@@@Determining Water Potential in Potatoes Through Osmotic Experiments\nUse Your Solutions To Find the Water Potential of Potato Cells. \n\n1) Use a cork borer to cut potatoes into identically sized chips, about 1 cm in diameter. \n\n2) Divide the chips into groups of three and measure the mass of each group using a mass balance. \n\n3) Place one group into each of your sucrose solutions. \n\n4) Leave the chips in the solutions for at least 20 minutes (making sure that they all get the same amount of time). \n\n5) Remove the chips and pat dry gently with a paper towel. \n\n6) Weigh each group again and record your results. \n\n7) Calculate the % change in mass for each group. \n\n8) Use the results to make a calibration curve, showing % change in mass against sucrose concentration. The potato chips will gain water (and therefore mass) in solutions with a higher water potential than the chips, and lose water in solutions with a lower water potential. The point at which the curve crosses the x-axis (where the % change in mass is 0) is the point at which the water potential of the sucrose solution is the same as the water potential of the potato cells. Find the concentration at this point, then look up the water potential for that concentration of sucrose solution in, e.g., a textbook.\n\n@@@Reviewing Osmosis and Applying Practical Knowledge\nPractice Questions\n\nQ1 Define osmosis. \n\nQ2 Give two factors that affect the rate of osmosis. \n\nQ3 What are serial dilutions?\n\nExam Question\n\nQ1 Pieces of potato of equal mass were put into different concentrations of sucrose solution for 24 hours. The difference in mass for each is recorded in the table. \n\na) Explain why the pieces of potato in 1% and 2% sucrose solutions gained mass. [2 marks] \n\nb) Suggest a reason why the mass of the piece of potato in 3% sucrose solution stayed the same.

Osmosis is just a fancy name for the diffusion of water molecules. But whether water moves in or out of a cell depends on the water potential of the surrounding solution. Water potential can be pretty confusing \u2014 if you can't make head nor tail of an exam question about it try replacing the word 'potential' with 'concentration' and it'll become clearer.","21":"@@@Introduction to Enzyme Activity and Factors Influencing It\nNow you know what enzymes are and how they work, let's take a look at what makes them tick. Humans need things like money and the newest mobile phone, but enzymes are quite content with the right temperature and pH.\n\n@@@Temperature's Influence on Enzyme Activity\nTemperature has a Big Influence on Enzyme Activity. Like any chemical reaction, the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction increases when the temperature's increased. More heat means more kinetic energy, so molecules move faster. This makes the enzymes more likely to collide with the substrate molecules. The energy of these collisions also increases, which means each collision is more likely to result in a reaction. But, if the temperature gets too high, the reaction stops. \n1) The rise in temperature makes the enzyme's molecules vibrate more. \n2) If the temperature goes above a certain level, this vibration breaks some of the bonds that hold the enzyme in shape. \n3) The active site changes shape and the enzyme and substrate no longer fit together. \n4) At this point, the enzyme is denatured\u2014 it no longer functions as a catalyst. \noptimum temperature \nTemperature\n\n@@@pH Influence on Enzyme Activity\npH Also Affects Enzyme Activity. Every enzyme has an optimum temperature. For most human enzymes, it's around 37\u00b0C but some enzymes, like those used in biological washing powders, can work well at 60 \u00b0C. All enzymes have an optimum pH value. Most human enzymes work best at pH 7 (neutral), but there are exceptions. Pepsin, for example, works best at acidic pH 2, which is useful because it's found in the stomach. Above and below the optimum pH, the H+ and OH- ions found in acids and alkalis can mess up the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds that hold the enzyme's tertiary structure in place. This makes the active site change shape, so the enzyme is denatured.\n\n@@@Effect of Enzyme Concentration on Reaction Rate\nEnzyme Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction. \n1) The more enzyme molecules there are in a solution, the more likely a substrate molecule is to collide with one and form an enzyme-substrate complex. So increasing the concentration of the enzyme increases the rate of reaction. \n2) But, if the amount of substrate is limited, there comes a point when there's more than enough enzyme molecules to deal with all the available substrate, so adding more enzyme has no further effect.\n\n@@@Impact of Substrate Concentration on The Rate of Reaction\nSubstrate Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction Up to a Point. \n1) The higher the substrate concentration, the faster the reaction\u2014more substrate molecules means a collision between substrate and enzyme is more likely and so more active sites will be used. This is only true up until a 'saturation' point though. After that, there are so many substrate molecules that the enzymes have about as much as they can cope with (all the active sites are full), and adding more makes no difference. \n2) Substrate concentration decreases with time during a reaction (unless more substrate is added to the reaction mixture), so if no other variables are changed, the rate of reaction will decrease over time too. This makes the initial rate of reaction (the reaction rate at the start) the highest rate of reaction.\n\n@@@Enzyme Inhibition Mechanisms\nEnzyme Activity can be Inhibited. Enzyme activity can be prevented by enzyme inhibitors. Inhibition can be competitive or non-competitive.\n\nCOMPETITIVE INHIBITION molecules that bind to the enzyme that they inhibit. \n1) Competitive inhibitor molecules have a similar shape to that of the substrate molecules. \n2) They compete with the substrate molecules to bind to the active site, but no reaction takes place. \n3) Instead they block the active site, so no substrate molecules can fit in it. \n4) How much the enzyme is inhibited depends on the relative concentrations of the inhibitor and the substrate. \n5) If there's a high concentration of the inhibitor, it'll take up nearly all the active sites and hardly any of the substrate wil get to the enzyme. \n6) But if there's a higher concentration of substrate, then the substrate's chances of getting to an active site before the inhibitor increase. So increasing the concentration of substrate will increase the rate of reaction (up to a point).\n\nNON-COMPETITIVE INHIBITION \n1) Non-competitive inhibitor molecules bind to the enzyme away from its active site. \n2) This causes the active site to change shape so the substrate molecules can no longer bind to it. \n3) They don't 'compete' with the substrate molecules to bind to the active site because they are a different shape. \n4) Increasing the concentration of substrate won't make any difference to the reaction rate\u2014enzyme activity will still be inhibited.\n\n@@@Practical Application and Understanding Enzyme Inhibition\nPractice Questions \nQ1 Draw a graph to show the effect of temperature on enzyme activity. \nQ2 Draw a graph to show the effect of pH on enzyme activity. \nQ3 Explain the effect of increasing substrate concentration on the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction.\n\nExam Question \nQ1 Inhibitors prevent enzymes from working properly.

Many poisons are enzyme inhibitors, e.g. cyanide. Even though there are thousands of enzymes in our bodies, inhibiting just one of them can cause severe problems. Some drugs are enzyme inhibitors though, e.g. penicillin, so they're not all bad.","22":"@@@The Immune System Overview\n\nAn infectious disease is one that is caused by pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Infectious diseases can be really nasty, but luckily there's an army of cells in the body that helps to protect us \u2014 the immune system. \n\n@@@Foreign Antigens Trigger an Immune Response\n\nAntigens are molecules (usually proteins) that can generate an immune response when detected by the body. They are usually found on the surface of cells and are used by the immune system to identify pathogens (organisms that cause disease), abnormal body cells (e.g., cancerous or pathogen-infected cells, which have abnormal antigens on their surface), toxins, and cells from other individuals of the same species (e.g., organ transplants).\n\n@@@Phagocytes Engulf Pathogens as the First Stage of the Immune Response\n\nThere are four main stages in the immune response: The first stage of the immune response involves phagocytes, which are a type of white blood cell that carries out phagocytosis (engulfment of pathogens). They're found in the blood and in tissues and are the first cells to respond to an immune system trigger inside the body. The process includes the phagocyte recognizing foreign antigens on a pathogen, engulfing it, containing it in a phagocytic vacuole, and then a lysosome fusing with this vacuole to break down the pathogen using lysozymes. Afterward, the phagocyte presents the pathogen's antigens on its surface to activate other immune system cells.\n\n@@@Phagocytes Activate T-cells as the Second Stage of the Immune Response\n\nThe next stage involves the activation of T-cells by phagocytes. A T-cell (also called a T-lymphocyte) with receptor proteins on its surface binds to complementary antigens presented by phagocytes. This activation of the T-cell leads to different responses by different types of T-cells, for example, helper T-cells (TH cells) release chemical signals that activate phagocytes and cytotoxic T-cells (Tc cells) which kill abnormal and foreign cells, as well as B-cells, which secrete antibodies.\n\n@@@T-cells Activate B-cells, Leading to Clonal Selection\n\nThe third stage is the activation of B-cells by T-cells, which divide into plasma cells. B-cells (B-lymphocytes) are covered with antibodies that bind antigens to form an antigen-antibody complex. The antibody on the surface of a B-cell binds to a complementary shaped antigen, and with substances released from helper T-cells, the B-cell is activated in clonal selection and divided into plasma cells.\n\n@@@Plasma Cells Produce Specific Antibodies as the Final Stage of the Immune Response\n\nThe fourth stage involves plasma cells, which are identical to the B-cell and secrete antibodies specific to the antigen. These antibodies can bind to pathogens resulting in agglutination where pathogens clump together, enabling phagocytes to phagocytose many pathogens at once. The destruction of pathogens carrying the antigen is thus facilitated in the body. Antibody specificity is based on the variable regions with unique tertiary structures complementary to specific antigens, and the constant regions are identical in all antibodies.\n\n@@@The Immune Response Subdivisions and Memory Formation\n\nThe immune response is split into two subdivisions: the cellular response involving T-cells and other cells, and the humoral response involving B-cells, clonal selection, and monoclonal antibody production. Both types of response remove pathogens and interact with each other, as T-cells help to activate B-cells, and antibodies make it easier for phagocytes to engulf pathogens. Memory cells are produced following exposure to an antigen which allows the body to quickly respond to a second infection, producing a quicker and stronger response, which is known as the secondary immune response. Memory cells remain in the body for a long time, with memory T-cells remembering the antigen and memory B-cells recording the antibodies needed.","23":"@@@Understanding Immunity and the Role of Vaccines\n\nImmunity and vaccines play crucial roles in protecting individuals and populations from diseases. The primary response grants immunity against a disease but only after an infection has occurred. Vaccination provides a method to stimulate memory cell production without actually contracting the disease. Vaccines contain antigens that induce the body to produce memory cells against a pathogen without causing disease symptoms, resulting in immunity without sickness. Individuals who are vaccinated are protected, and herd immunity is established, decreasing the likelihood of disease spread, even to those who are not vaccinated. Vaccines may contain free antigens or ones attached to dead or weakened pathogens and can be administered through injection or oral intake. Booster vaccines may be required to ensure ongoing production of memory cells.\n\n@@@The Challenge of Antigenic Variation in Pathogen Evasion\n\nNot all pathogens are easily thwarted by the immune system. Antigenic variation occurs when pathogens alter their surface antigens, enabling them to evade the immune response even upon subsequent infections. This genetic change in pathogens such as HIV and influenza virus complicates vaccine development, as memory cells from a previous infection will not recognize newly altered antigens. The flu vaccine exemplifies this, as it must be updated annually to combat new strains of the virus that arise due to antigenic variation, with health authorities working to select and distribute the most effective vaccine each year. This dynamic challenge requires adaptive strategies to provide protection against evolving pathogens.\n\n@@@Active and Passive Immunity: Types and Characteristics\n\nImmunity can be categorized into active and passive forms. Active immunity, where the immune system produces its own antibodies in response to an antigen, can be natural, following an infection, or artificial, resulting from vaccination. Passive immunity involves the transfer of antibodies from another organism, and can also be natural, such as maternal antibodies, or artificial, through antibody injections like those used in response to tetanus. The differences between these types of immunity are significant. Active immunity leads to memory cell production and long-term protection, while passive immunity provides immediate but temporary protection without memory cell formation.\n\n@@@Practical Understanding and Examination of Immunity Concepts\n\nThe study of immunity encompasses both practical understanding and theoretical knowledge, often assessed in exams. Students may encounter questions about the mechanics of vaccines, the concept of antigenic variability, and the distinctions between active and passive immunity. Exam questions might explore the effectiveness of vaccination programs, the recurring nature of diseases like influenza, and the timing and duration of immune protection afforded by different types of immunity. These questions help solidify understanding of immunological principles and their applications in medical science.","24":"@@@ Antibodies in Medicine: Their Crucial Role in Health and Disease\nAntibodies aren't only great for fighting off infection, they're also excellent tools for use in medical diagnosis and drug development. Let's all give three cheers for antibodies. Without them, we'd all probably be dead by now.\n\n@@@ Monoclonal Antibodies: Precision Tools for Targeted Therapy\nMonoclonal antibodies are antibodies produced from a single group of genetically identical B-cells (plasma cells). This means that they're all identical in structure. As you know, antibodies are very specific because their binding sites have a unique tertiary structure (see p.44) that only one particular antigen will fit into (one with a complementary shape). You can make monoclonal antibodies that bind to anything you want, e.g., a cell antigen or other substance, and they will only bind to (target) this molecule.\n\nEXAMPLE: Targeting Drugs to Cancer Cells\n1) Different cells in the body have different surface antigens.\n2) Cancer cells have antigens called tumor markers that are not found on normal body cells.\n3) Monoclonal antibodies can be made that will bind to the tumor markers.\n4) You can also attach anti-cancer drugs to the antibodies.\n5) When the antibodies come into contact with the cancer cells they will bind to the tumor markers.\n6) This means the drug will only accumulate in the body where there are cancer cells.\n7) So, the side effects of an antibody-based drug are lower than other drugs because they accumulate near specific cells.\n\nEXAMPLE: Medical Diagnosis Through Pregnancy Testing\nPregnancy tests detect the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) that's found in the urine of pregnant women:\n1) The application area contains antibodies for hCG bound to a colored bead (blue).\n2) When urine is applied to the application area any hCG will bind to the antibody on the beads, forming an antigen-antibody complex.\n3) The urine moves up the stick to the test strip, carrying any beads with it.\n4) The test strip contains antibodies to hCG that are stuck in place (immobilized).\n5) If there is hCG present the test strip turns blue because the immobilized antibody binds to any hCG \u2014 concentrating the hCG-antibody complex with the blue beads attached.\nIf no hCG is present, the beads will pass through the test area without binding to anything, and so it won't go blue.\n\n@@@ The ELISA Test: A Versatile Method for Medical Diagnosis Using Antibodies\nThe enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) allows you to see if a patient has any antibodies to a certain antigen (see example below) or any antigen to a certain antibody. It can be used to test for pathogenic infections, for allergies (e.g. to nuts or lactose), and for just about anything you can make an antibody for. In an ELISA test, an antibody is used which has an enzyme attached to it. This enzyme can react with a substrate to produce a colored product. This causes the solution in the reaction vessel to change color. If there's a color change, it demonstrates that the antigen or antibody of interest is present in the sample being tested (e.g., blood plasma). In some types of ELISA, the quantity of this antigen\/antibody can be worked out from the intensity of the color change. \n\nThere are several different types of ELISA:\n- Direct ELISA uses a single antibody that is complementary to the antigen you're testing for.\n- Indirect ELISA uses two different antibodies. This method is outlined below:\n\nEXAMPLE: Using an ELISA as an HIV Test\nAn indirect ELISA test can be used to see if a patient possesses antibodies to the HIV virus:\n1) HIV antigen is bound to the bottom of a well in a well plate (a plastic tray with loads of little circular pits in it).\n2) A sample of the patient's blood plasma, which might contain several different antibodies, is added to the well.\n3) If there are any HIV-specific antibodies (i.e., antibodies against HIV), these will bind to the HIV antigen stuck to the bottom of the well.\n4) The well is then washed out to remove any unbound antibodies.\n5) A secondary antibody, that has a specific enzyme attached to it, is added to the well.\n6) This secondary antibody can bind to the HIV-specific antibody (which is also called the primary antibody). \n7) The well is washed out again to remove any unbound secondary antibody. If there's no primary antibody in the sample, all of the secondary antibody will be washed away.\n8) A solution is added to the well. This solution contains a substrate, which is able to react with the enzyme attached to the secondary antibody and produce a colored product.\n9) If the solution changes color, it indicates that the patient has HIV-specific antibodies in their blood and is infected with HIV.\n\nThe washing steps are important to make sure unbound antibodies aren't left in the well, which could affect the results. For instance, unbound secondary antibodies could cause the test to appear positive when there are no HIV antibodies present. If the result was negative, there would be no color change because there would be no HIV-specific antibodies for the secondary antibody to bind to.\n\n@@@ Practice Questions: Testing Your Understanding of Antibodies\nQ1: What are monoclonal antibodies?\nExam Question: Describe how monoclonal antibodies can be used to target a drug to cancer cells. [4 marks]\nAntibodies \u2014 the multi-tool of the immune system... Monoclonal antibodies are really useful \u2014 they can even be made against other antibodies. For example, people with asthma produce too many of a type of antibody that causes inflammation in the lungs. Monoclonal antibodies can be made to bind this type of antibody, so it can no longer cause inflammation, which can reduce the asthma symptoms.","25":"@@@Introduction to Lipids\nLipids are really nice. Without them, we'd have no cell membranes. You owe it to them to make sure you can remember all of the stuff about them on these pages. It'll help you and your membranes get a good grade.\n\n@@@Triglycerides and Their Structure\nTriglycerides are a kind of lipid, having one molecule of glycerol with three fatty acids attached to it. Fatty acid molecules have long tails made of hydrocarbons. The tails are 'hydrophobic' (they repel water molecules), making lipids insoluble in water. All fatty acids have the same basic structure, with a carbon atom linking the fatty acid to the glycerol, an 'R' group which is the variable hydrocarbon tail, and the carboxyl group ('COOH') bonded to the rest of the molecule.\n\n@@@Formation of Triglycerides Through Condensation Reactions\nTriglycerides are formed through a process where fatty acids join to a glycerol molecule. When a fatty acid attaches to glycerol, an ester bond is formed, and a molecule of water is released\u2014a condensation reaction. This process is repeated two more times to form a complete triglyceride, where each of the three fatty acids is linked to the glycerol backbone.\n\n@@@Variations in Fatty Acids: Saturated vs. Unsaturated\nFatty acids can be classified as saturated or unsaturated, depending on the presence of double bonds within their hydrocarbon tails. Saturated fatty acids do not contain any double bonds between their carbon atoms, while unsaturated fatty acids have at least one double bond, causing the chain to kink.\n\n@@@Phospholipids and Their Role in Cell Membranes\nPhospholipids, which are the primary lipids found in cell membranes, share similarities with triglycerides. However, they have one significant difference: one of the fatty acid molecules in a phospholipid is replaced by a phosphate group. The phosphate group is hydrophilic (attracts water), contrasting with the hydrophobic nature (repel water) of the fatty acid tails. This dual nature is crucial for the structure and function of the cell membrane.\n\n@@@Appendix: Course Structure\nThe text likely comes from a section of a larger educational material, indicated by \"Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\".","26":"@@@HIV and Viruses: Basic Concepts and Impact on the Immune System\n\nViruses aren't cells like bacteria. They're not even living things\u2014they can only reproduce inside the cells of another organism (called the host). All viruses cause disease, and you need to know all about one particularly nasty blighter...HIV is the Virus That Causes AIDS. 1) HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that affects the immune system. It eventually leads to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). 2) AIDS is a condition where the immune system deteriorates and eventually fails. This makes someone with AIDS more vulnerable to other infections, like pneumonia (see next page). 3) HIV infects (and eventually kills) helper T-cells, which act as the host cells (see p. 28) for the virus. Remember, helper T-cells send chemical signals that activate phagocytes, cytotoxic T-cells and B-cells (see p. 44) so they're hugely important cells in the immune response. Without enough helper T-cells, the immune system is unable to mount an effective response to infections because other immune system cells don't behave how they should. 4) People infected with HIV develop AIDS when the helper T-cell numbers in their body reach a critically low level.\n\n@@@The Structure of HIV\n\nHIV has a Spherical Structure. You might get asked about the structure of HIV in your exam. 1) A core that contains the genetic material (RNA) and some proteins (including the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is needed for virus replication). 2) An outer coating of protein called a capsid. 3) An extra outer layer called an envelope. This is made of membrane stolen from the cell membrane of a previous host cell. 4) Sticking out from the envelope are loads of copies of an attachment protein that help HIV attach to the host helper T-cell.\n\n@@@HIV Replication Process\n\nHIV Replicates Inside its Host\u2019s Helper T-Cells. HIV (and all other viruses) can only reproduce inside the cells of the organism it has infected. HIV replicates inside the helper T-cells of the host. It doesn't have the equipment (such as enzymes and ribosomes) to replicate on its own, so it uses those of the host cell. Here's how HIV replicates: 1) The attachment protein attaches to a receptor molecule on the cell membrane of the host helper T-cell. 2) The capsid is released into the cell, where it uncoats and releases the genetic material (RNA) into the cell's cytoplasm. 3) Inside the cell, reverse transcriptase is used to make a complementary strand of DNA from the viral RNA template (see p. 16-17 for more on DNA and RNA). 4) From this, double-stranded DNA is made and inserted into the human DNA. 5) Host cell enzymes are used to make viral proteins from the viral DNA found within the human DNA. 6) The viral proteins are assembled into new viruses, which bud from the cell and go on to infect other cells. During the initial infection period, HIV replicates rapidly and the infected person may experience severe flu-like symptoms. After this period, HIV replication drops to a lower level. This is the latency period. During the latency period (which can last for years), the infected person won't experience any symptoms.\n\n@@@Clinical Progression and Illnesses Associated with AIDS\n\nPeople with AIDS are Susceptible to a Range of Illnesses. People with HIV are classed as having AIDS when symptoms of their failing immune system start to appear or their helper T-cell count drops below a certain level. People with AIDS generally develop diseases that wouldn't cause serious problems in people with a healthy immune system. The length of time between infection with HIV and the development of AIDS varies between individuals but without treatment it's usually around 10 years. 1) The initial symptoms of AIDS include minor infections of mucous membranes (e.g. the inside of the nose, ears and genitals), and recurring respiratory infections. 2) As AIDS progresses the number of immune system cells decreases further. Patients become susceptible to more serious infections including chronic diarrhoea, severe bacterial infections and tuberculosis. 3) During the late stages of AIDS patients have a very low number of immune system cells and can develop a range of serious infections such as toxoplasmosis of the brain (a parasite infection) and candidiasis of the respiratory system (fungal infection). It's these serious infections that kill AIDS patients, not HIV itself. The length of time that people survive with AIDS varies a lot. Factors that affect progression of HIV to AIDS and survival time with AIDS include existing infections, the strain of HIV they're infected with, age and access to healthcare.\n\n@@@Why Antibiotics Are Ineffective Against HIV and Treatment Strategies\n\nAntibiotics Don\u2019t Work Against Viruses. 1) Antibiotics kill bacteria by interfering with their metabolic reactions. They target the bacterial enzymes and ribosomes used in these reactions. 2) Bacterial enzymes and ribosomes are different from human enzymes and ribosomes. Antibiotics are designed to only target the bacterial ones so they don't damage human cells. Makes sense. 3) Viruses don't have their own enzymes and ribosomes\u2014they use the ones in the host's cells. So because human viruses use human enzymes and ribosomes to replicate, antibiotics can't inhibit them because they don't target human processes. 4) Most antiviral drugs are designed to target the few virus-specific enzymes (enzymes that only the virus uses) that exist. For example, HIV uses reverse transcriptase to replicate (see previous page). Human cells don't use this enzyme so drugs can be designed to inhibit it without affecting the host cell. These drugs are called reverse-transcriptase inhibitors.\n\nThere\u2019s No Cure for HIV. 1) There's currently no cure or vaccine for HIV but antiviral drugs can be used to slow down the progression of HIV infection and AIDS in an infected person. 2) The best way to control HIV infection in a population is by reducing its spread. HIV can be spread via unprotected sexual intercourse, through infected bodily fluids (e.g. like blood from sharing contaminated needles) and from a HIV-positive mother to her fetus. Not all babies from HIV-positive mothers are born infected with HIV and taking antiviral drugs during pregnancy can reduce the chance of the baby being HIV-positive.\n\n@@@Summary and Reflection on Viral Diseases\n\nViruses can be dangerous and hard to treat\u2014they\u2019re just not funny...Well, apart from rhinoviruses, which cause colds, but they're only funny because of the name. It's actually quite a logical name\u2014rhino is from the Greek for nose. They're literally nose viruses. If I was a virus I'd choose somewhere better to infect. Anyway, you need to learn this stuff. Scribble everything down and see what you remember.\n\nPractice Questions- V testing, based on HIV '- anybody detection, before a =- baby is 18 months old can be \u00a3 \u00a3 inaccurate. This is because -- the baby of an HIV-positive \u00a3- mother may have some HIV \u00a3- antibodies in their blood Z- regardless of whether or not \u00a3they're infected.\n\nExam Question\nQ1 What type of cell does HIV replicate in?\nQ2 Why can't antibiotics be used to treat HIV?\n\nQ1 HIV is the virus that eventually causes AIDS. Describe the structure of HIV.

Every organism, whatever its size, needs to exchange things with its environment. Otherwise there'd be no such thing as poop scoops...\n\n1) Cells need to take in oxygen (for aerobic respiration) and nutrients.\n2) They also need to excrete waste products like carbon dioxide and urea.\n3) Most organisms need to stay at roughly the same temperature, so heat needs to be exchanged too.\n\nHow easy the exchange of substances is depends on the organism's surface area to volume ratio.\n\n@@@The Science Behind Surface Area to Volume Ratios in Different Animals\n\nA mouse has a bigger surface area relative to its volume than a hippo. This can be hard to imagine, but you can prove it mathematically. Imagine these animals as cubes:\n\nThe hippo could be represented by a block measuring 2 cm x 4 cm x 4 cm. Its volume is 2 x 4 x 4 = 32 cm3. Its surface area is 2 x 4 x 4 = 32 cm2 (top and bottom surfaces of cube) + 4x2x4 = 32 cm2 (four sides of the cube). Total surface area = 64 cm2. So the hippo has a surface area: volume ratio of 64:32 or 2:1. Compare this to a cube mouse measuring 1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm. Its volume is 1 x 1 x 1 = 1 cm3. Its surfacc area is 6 x 1 x 1 = 6 cm2. So the mouse has a surface area: volume ratio of 6:1. The cube mouse's surface area is six times its volume, but the cube hippo's surface area is only twice its volume. Smaller animals have a bigger surface compared to their volume.\n\n@@@Why Multicellular Organisms Rely on Exchange Organs and Mass Transport Systems\n\nAn organism needs to supply every one of its cells with substances like glucose and oxygen (for respiration). It also needs to remove waste products from every cell to avoid damaging itself.\n\n1) In single-celled organisms, these substances can diffuse directly into (or out of) the cell across the cell-surface membrane. The diffusion rate is quick because of the small distances the substances have to travel.\n2) In multicellular animals, diffusion across the outer membrane is too slow, for two reasons: Some cells are deep within the body \u2014 there's a big distance between them and the outside environment. Larger animals have a low surface area to volume ratio \u2014 it's difficult to exchange enough substances to supply a large volume of animal through a relatively small outer surface.\n\nSo rather than using straightforward diffusion to absorb and excrete substances, multicellular animals need specialised exchange organs (like lungs). They also need an efficient system to carry substances to and from their individual cells \u2014 this is mass transport. In mammals, 'mass transport' normally refers to the circulatory system, which uses blood to carry glucose and oxygen around the body. It also carries hormones, antibodies and waste like CO2. Mass transport in plants involves the transport of water and solutes in the xylem and phloem.\n\n@@@How Body Size and Shape Influence Heat Exchange in Organisms\n\nAs well as creating waste products that need to be transported away, the metabolic activity inside cells creates heat. Staying at the right temperature is difficult, and it's pretty heavily influenced by your size and shape...\n\nSize: The rate of heat loss from an organism depends on its surface area. If an organism has a large volume, e.g. a hippo, its surface area is relatively small. This makes it harder for it to lose heat from its body. If an organism is small, e.g. a mouse, its relative surface area is large, so heat is lost more easily. This means smaller organisms need a relatively high metabolic rate, in order to generate enough heat to stay warm.\n\nShape: \n1) Animals with a compact shape have a small surface area relative to their volume\u2014minimising heat loss from their surface.\n2) Animals with a less compact shape (those that are a bit gangly or have sticky outy bits) have a larger surface area relative to their volume\u2014this increases heat loss from their surface.\n3) Whether an animal is compact or not depends on the temperature of its environment. Here's an example:\n- Arctic fox has small ears and a round head to reduce its SA:V ratio and heat loss.\n- African bat-eared fox has large ears and a more pointed nose to increase its SA:V ratio and heat loss.\n- European fox is intermediate between the two, matching the temperature of its environment.\n\n@@@Adaptation Strategies of Organisms for Efficient Exchange\n\nNot all organisms have a body size or shape to suit their climate\u2014some have other adaptations instead...\n1) Animals with a high SA:volume ratio tend to lose more water as it evaporates from their surface. Some small desert mammals have kidney structure adaptations so that they produce less urine to compensate.\n2) To support their high metabolic rates, small mammals living in cold regions need to eat large amounts of high energy foods such as seeds and nuts.\n3) Smaller mammals may have thick layers of fur or hibernate when the weather gets really cold.\n4) Larger organisms living in hot regions, e.g. elephants and hippos, find it hard to keep cool as their heat loss is relatively slow. Elephants have developed large flat ears to increase their surface area, allowing them to lose more heat. Hippos spend much of the day in the water\u2014a behavioural adaptation to help them lose heat.","28":"@@@Introduction to Gas Exchange in Humans\nIn humans, gas exchange takes place in the lungs. You need to know the structure of the lungs as well as how they're ventilated... take a deep breath... Lungs are Specialised Organs for Gas Exchange. Humans need to get oxygen into the blood (for respiration) and they need to get rid of carbon dioxide (made by respiring cells). This is where breathing (or ventilation as it's sometimes called) and the gas exchange system comes in.\n\n@@@Human Gas Exchange System\nHuman Gas Exchange System includes intercostal muscles, bronchus, bronchiole, alveoli. The process starts when you breathe in, as air enters the trachea (windpipe). The trachea splits into two bronchi \u2014 one bronchus leading to each lung. Each bronchus then branches off into smaller tubes called bronchioles. The bronchioles end in small 'air sacs' called alveoli (this is where gases are exchanged \u2014 see next page). The ribcage, intercostal muscles, and diaphragm all work together to move air in and out. There are actually three layers of intercostal muscles. You need to know about two of them (the internal and external intercostal muscles) for your exam. We've only shown one layer here for simplicity.\n\n@@@Ventilation: Breathing In and Out\nVentilation consists of inspiration (breathing in) and expiration (breathing out). It's controlled by the movements of the diaphragm, internal and external intercostal muscles, and ribcage. Inspiration involves the contraction of the external intercostal and diaphragm muscles, causing the ribcage to move upwards and outwards and the diaphragm to flatten, increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity. As the volume of the thoracic cavity increases, the lung pressure decreases (to below atmospheric pressure). Air will always flow from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure (i.e. down a pressure gradient) so air flows down the trachea and into the lungs. Inspiration is an active process \u2014 it requires energy. Expiration occurs when the muscles relax, causing the ribcage to move downwards and inwards and the diaphragm becomes curved again. This decreases the thoracic cavity's volume and increases air pressure, forcing air out of the lungs. Normal expiration is a passive process and doesn't require energy. During forced expiration, external intercostal muscles relax and internal intercostal muscles contract, pulling the ribcage further down and in. This antagonistic motion facilitates expiration.\n\n@@@Gas Exchange in Alveoli\nIn Humans, gaseous exchange happens in the alveoli. Lungs contain millions of these microscopic air sacs where gas exchange occurs. The alveoli have a large surface area due to the huge number of them present in the lungs, which facilitates the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Each alveolus is made from a single layer of thin, flat cells called alveolar epithelium. Oxygenated blood is sent to the heart while deoxygenated blood arrives from the heart, facilitating the diffusion of O2 out of the alveoli into the blood and CO2 from the blood into the alveoli to be expelled. The Alveoli are anatomically designed to enable efficient gas exchange. Their structural features include a thin exchange surface and a large surface area, along with a steep concentration gradient of oxygen and carbon dioxide, which is continuously maintained by the flow of blood and ventilation.\n\n@@@Practice and Exam Questions\nThere are questions for practice and examination.T he practice questions include: Describe the structure of the human gas exchange system, How is normal expiration different to forced expiration? Describe the movement of carbon dioxide and oxygen across the alveolar epithelium. While exam questions ask to describe two ways in which lungs are adapted for efficient gas exchange and describe the process of inspiration. Each question has a mark allocation indicating its significance or length of response expected. The context of these questions surrounds the adaptation of alveoli and their crucial role in gas exchange, reinforcing the material that needs to be mastered for a deeper understanding of human respiratory physiology.\n\n@@@Lungs and Alveoli: Biological Interface with the Environment\nA mammal's lungs act as an interface with the environment \u2014 they take in air and give out waste gases. Ventilation is the process that moves these gases into and out of the lungs, but the actual exchange of gases with the bloodstream is the responsibility of the alveoli. These well-adapted biological structures are essential for a mammal's respiratory system to function efficiently. The reference to pasta is likely a mnemonic device or a didactic metaphor to facilitate the memorization of the alveoli's function and form.","29":"@@@Overview and Preparation for Dissecting Gas Exchange Systems\nAfter learning all about how different organisms are adapted for efficient gas exchange, you might be wondering what those structures really look like. Well, here are some lovely dissections that you might do. How exciting. As part of your AS or A level in Biology, you're expected to carry out at least one dissection. It could be a dissection of a gaseous exchange system or a mass transport system (or an organ within one of those systems) in either an animal or a plant. You could also be asked about dissections in your exams. There's an example of a plant dissection that you could do on page 79. These two pages cover some animal dissections that you could do as well or instead. Whether it's a plant or animal dissection, you're expected to know how to carry it out safely and ethically. You might also need to record your observations using labelled diagrams.\n\n@@@Dissecting the Gaseous Exchange Systems of Animals\nFirst up, lung dissection is messy, so make sure you're wearing a lab coat. Your dissecting tools (e.g. scalpels, dissecting scissors) should all be clean, sharp, and free from rust \u2014 blunt tools don't cut well and can be dangerous. Lay the lungs your teacher has given you on a cutting board. They'll probably be sheep or pig lungs from a butcher's shop. You should be able to see the trachea and two bronchi going into the lungs. To see the lungs inflate, attach a piece of rubber tubing to the trachea and pump air into the lungs using a foot or bicycle pump. The lungs will deflate by themselves because of the elastin in the walls of the alveoli (see p. 61). Never blow down the tube to inflate the lungs \u2014 you could end up sucking up stale air from inside the lungs into your mouth. Pop the lungs in a clear plastic bag before you start to stop bacteria inside the lungs from being released into the room. Once you've seen the lungs inflate, you can examine the different tissue types in the lungs. The trachea is supported by C-shaped rings of cartilage. If you do cut the cartilage, be careful \u2014 you need to wear goggles to protect your eyes. Cartilage is tough, so if you want to open up the trachea, it's best to cut it lengthways, down the gap in the C-shaped rings. Use dissecting scissors or a scalpel to make the cut. If using a scalpel, cut downwards (not towards you), and don't apply too much pressure to the blade. Continue cutting down one of the bronchi. You should be able to see the bronchioles branching off. Cut off a piece of the lung. The tissue will feel spongy because of the air trapped in all the alveoli. Lungs from a butcher are safe for humans to handle, but they could still contain bacteria that cause food poisoning. That's why it's important to wash your hands after the dissection and disinfect work surfaces.\n\n@@@Dissecting Fish Gills in Bony Fish\nAgain, make sure you're wearing an apron or lab coat. Place your chosen fish (something like a perch or salmon works well) in a dissection tray or on a cutting board. Gills are located on either side of the fish's head. They're protected on each side by a bony flap called an operculum and supported by gill arches. To remove the gills, push back the operculum and use scissors to carefully remove the gills. Cut each gill arch through the bone at the top and bottom. They should look a bit like this: If you look closely, you should be able to see the gill filaments. For more information about the structure and function of fish gills, see page 56. A single gill arch operculum (the gills are under here)\ngill filaments\n\n@@@Dissecting the Gaseous Exchange System in Insects\nBig insects like grasshoppers or cockroaches are usually best for dissecting because they're easier to handle. For dissection, you'll need to use an insect that's been humanely killed fairly recently. First fix the insect to a dissecting board. You can put dissecting pins through its legs to hold it in place. To examine the tracheae, you'll need to carefully cut and remove a piece of exoskeleton (the insect's hard outer shell) from along the length of the insect's abdomen. Use a syringe to fill the abdomen with saline solution. You should be able to see a network of very thin, silvery-grey tubes \u2014 these are the tracheae. They look silver because they're filled with air. You can examine the tracheae under an optical microscope using a temporary mount slide (see p. 30). Again, the tracheae will appear silver or grey. You should also be able to see rings of chitin in the walls of the tracheae \u2014 these are there for support (like the rings of cartilage in a human trachea). Some live insects, e.g. grasshoppers, can cause allergic reactions in some people. They need to be handled very carefully.\n\n@@@Ethical Considerations in Dissection\nDissecting animals (including fish and insects) can give you a better understanding of their anatomy. However, there are some ethical issues involved. Here are some points to think about: Some people argue that it is morally wrong to kill animals just for dissections, as it is unnecessary killing. However, many dissections that are carried out in schools involve animals that have already been killed for their meat, e.g. the sheep's lung dissection on the previous page. (Some people disagree with killing animals altogether though.) There are concerns that the animals used for dissections are not always raised in a humane way \u2014 they may be subject to overcrowding, extremes of temperature, or lack of food \u2014 and they may not be killed humanely either. If animals (e.g. insects) are raised in school for dissection, it's important to make sure they are looked after properly and killed humanely to minimize any suffering or distress.\n\n@@@Applying Knowledge and Preparing for Exams\nPractice Questions\nQ1: Why is it important that dissecting tools are sharp?\nQ2: Describe how to remove the gills in a bony fish.\nExam Questions\nQ1: A student is examining grasshopper tracheae under the microscope. The tracheae were taken from a preserved grasshopper specimen. The grasshopper was killed some time ago and kept in a liquid preservative. The tracheae do not appear silver under the microscope.

As you might imagine, this involves loads of different chemical reactions and our old friends, enzymes. \n\n@@@The Process of Breaking Down Food Molecules During Digestion\n1) The large biological molecules (e.g. starch, proteins) in food are too big to cross cell membranes. This means they can't be absorbed from the gut into the blood. \n2) During digestion, these large molecules are broken down into smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, amino acids), which can move across cell membranes. This means they can be easily absorbed from the gut into the blood, to be transported around the body for use by the body cells. \n3) You might remember from Topic 1 A, that most large biological molecules are polymers, which can be broken down into smaller molecules (monomers) using hydrolysis reactions. Hydrolysis reactions break bonds by adding water. \n4) During hydrolysis, carbohydrates are broken down into disaccharides and then monosaccharides. Fats are broken down into fatty acids and monoglycerides. Proteins are broken down into amino acids.\n\n@@@The Role of Digestive Enzymes in Breaking Down Food\n1) A variety of different digestive enzymes are produced by specialised cells in the digestive systems of mammals. These enzymes are then released into the gut to mix with food. \n2) Since enzymes only work with specific substrates (see page 11), different enzymes are needed to catalyse the breakdown of different food molecules.\n\n@@@Carbohydrate Breakdown by Amylase and Disaccharidases\n1) Amylase is a digestive enzyme that catalyses the conversion of starch (a polysaccharide) into the smaller sugar maltose (a disaccharide). This involves the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds in starch. \n2) Amylase is produced by the salivary glands (which release amylase into the mouth) and also by the pancreas (which releases amylase into the small intestine). \n3) Membrane-bound disaccharidases are enzymes that are attached to the cell membranes of epithelial cells lining the ileum (the final part of the small intestine). They help to break down disaccharides (e.g. maltose, sucrose, and lactose) into monosaccharides (e.g. glucose, fructose, and galactose). Again, this involves the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds. \n4) Monosaccharides can be transported across the cell membranes of the ileum epithelial cells via specific transporter proteins (see next page). The diagram shows the conversion of disaccharides into monosaccharides by disaccharidase enzymes.\n\n@@@Lipid Digestion by Lipase and the Action of Bile Salts\n1) Lipase enzymes catalyse the breakdown of lipids into monoglycerides and fatty acids. This involves the hydrolysis of the ester bonds in lipids. \n2) Lipases are made in the pancreas. They work in the small intestine. \n3) Bile salts are produced by the liver and emulsify lipids \u2014 this means they cause the lipids to form small droplets. \n4) Bile salts are really important in the process of lipid digestion. Several small lipid droplets have a bigger surface area than a single large droplet (for the same volume of lipid). So the formation of small droplets greatly increases the surface area of lipid that's available for lipases to work on. \n5) Once the lipid has been broken down, the monoglycerides and fatty acids stick with the bile salts to form tiny structures called micelles.\n\n@@@Protein Breakdown by Endopeptidases and Exopeptidases\nProteins are broken down by a combination of different proteases (or peptidases). These are enzymes that catalyse the conversion of proteins into amino acids by hydrolysing the peptide bonds between amino acids. Endopeptidases hydrolyse peptide bonds within a protein, while exopeptidases act at the ends of protein molecules to remove single amino acids. Dipeptidases, a type of exopeptidase, work specifically on dipeptides, separating the two amino acids. Examples of endopeptidases include trypsin, chymotrypsin, and pepsin, which are synthesised in the pancreas and released into the small intestine, except for pepsin which is active in the stomach.\n\n@@@Absorption of Digestion Products Across Cell Membranes\nThe products of digestion are absorbed across the ileum epithelium into the bloodstream. Monosaccharides like glucose and galactose are absorbed by active transport along with sodium ions, while fructose is absorbed through facilitated diffusion. Lipid digestion products such as monoglycerides and fatty acids are absorbed with the aid of micelles, which move them towards the epithelium. Amino acids are absorbed using sodium-dependent transporter proteins in the epithelial cell membranes.\n\n@@@Practice and Exam Questions on Digestion\nQ1: What is the function of amylase in digestion?\nQ2: Describe the role of bile salts in lipid digestion.\nFor an exam, questions might involve topics such as lactose intolerance, where one is required to suggest which disaccharidase enzyme is deficient and describe how the digestion products of lactose are absorbed across the epithelial cells of the ileum. \n\n@@@Summary and Encouragement\nThe concept of digestion and absorption can seem daunting due to the detailed processes and numerous enzymes involved. However, breaking down the information like the digestive system breaks down food can make it easier to understand. Recognizing that enzyme names are often linked to their function can be helpful for remembering key details.","31":"@@@INTRODUCTION TO HAEMOGLOBIN AND ITS FUNCTION IN OXYGEN TRANSPORT\n\nHaemoglobin is a protein that carries oxygen around the body. Different species have different versions of it depending on where each species lives. Oxygen is Carried Round the Body by Haemoglobin. Red blood cells contain haemoglobin (Hb). Haemoglobin is a large protein with a quaternary structure - it's made up of more than one polypeptide chain (four of them in fact). Each chain has a haem group, which contains an iron ion and gives haemoglobin its red colour. Haemoglobin has a high affinity for oxygen \u2014 each molecule can carry four oxygen molecules. In the lungs, oxygen joins to haemoglobin in red blood cells to form oxyhaemoglobin. This is a reversible reaction \u2014 when oxygen leaves oxyhaemoglobin (dissociates from it) near the body cells, it turns back to haemoglobin. There are many chemically similar types of haemoglobin found in many different organisms, all of which carry out the same function. As well as being found in all vertebrates, haemoglobin is found in earthworms, starfish, some insects, some plants, and even in some bacteria.\n\n@@@HAEMOGLOBIN SATURATION DEPENDS ON PARTIAL PRESSURE OF OXYGEN\n\nHaemoglobin Saturation Depends on the Partial Pressure of Oxygen. The partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) is a measure of oxygen concentration. The greater the concentration of dissolved oxygen in cells, the higher the partial pressure. Similarly, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) is a measure of the concentration of CO2 in a cell. Haemoglobin's affinity for oxygen varies depending on the partial pressure of oxygen: Oxygen loads onto haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin where there's a high pO2, and Oxyhaemoglobin unloads its oxygen where there's a lower pO2. Oxygen enters blood capillaries at the alveoli in the lungs. Alveoli have a high pO2 so oxygen loads onto haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin. When cells respire, they use up oxygen \u2014 this lowers the pO2. Red blood cells deliver oxyhaemoglobin to respiring tissues, where it unloads its oxygen. The haemoglobin then returns to the lungs to pick up more oxygen.\n\n@@@DISSOCIATION CURVES AND OXYGEN TRANSPORT\n\nDissociation Curves Show How Affinity for Oxygen Varies. A dissociation curve shows how saturated the haemoglobin is with oxygen at any given partial pressure. 100% saturation means every haemoglobin molecule is carrying the maximum of 4 molecules of oxygen, and 0% saturation means none of the haemoglobin molecules are carrying any oxygen. The graph is 'S-shaped' because when haemoglobin (Hb) combines with the first O2 molecule, its shape alters in a way that makes it easier for other molecules to join too. But as the Hb starts to become saturated, it gets harder for more oxygen molecules to join. As a result, the curve has a steep bit in the middle where it's really easy for oxygen molecules to join, and shallow bits at each end where it's harder. When the curve is steep, a small change in pO2 causes a big change in the amount of oxygen carried by the Hb.\n\n@@@OXYGEN UNLOADING INFLUENCED BY CARBON DIOXIDE CONCENTRATION AND THE BOHR EFFECT\n\nCarbon Dioxide Concentration Affects Oxygen Unloading. To complicate matters, haemoglobin gives up its oxygen more readily at higher partial pressures of carbon dioxide (pCO2). It's a cunning way of getting more oxygen to cells during activity. When cells respire they produce carbon dioxide, which raises the pCO2. This increases the rate of oxygen unloading (i.e., the rate at which oxyhaemoglobin dissociates to form haemoglobin and oxygen) \u2014 so the dissociation curve 'shifts' right. The saturation of blood with oxygen is lower for a given pO2, meaning that more oxygen is being released. This is called the Bohr effect.\n\n@@@ADAPTATION AND VARIATION OF HAEMOGLOBIN IN DIFFERENT ORGANISMS\n\nHaemoglobin is Different in Different Organisms. Different organisms have different types of haemoglobin with different oxygen transporting capacities. Having a particular type of haemoglobin is an adaptation that helps the organism survive in a particular environment. Organisms that live in environments with a low concentration of oxygen have haemoglobin with a higher affinity for oxygen than human haemoglobin \u2014 the dissociation curve is to the left of ours. Organisms that are very active and have a high oxygen demand have haemoglobin with a lower affinity for oxygen than human haemoglobin \u2014 the curve is to the right of the human one.\n\n@@@PRACTICE AND EXAM QUESTIONS ON HAEMOGLOBIN AND DISSOCIATION CURVES\n\nPractice Questions. Q1 How many oxygen molecules can each haemoglobin molecule carry? Q2 Where in the body would you find a low partial pressure of oxygen? Q3 Why are oxygen dissociation curves S-shaped? Exam Question.

Well, I don't know about you but after these pages I need a sit down. Most people get their knickers in a twist over partial pressure \u2014 it's not the easiest thing to understand. Whenever you see it written down just pretend it says concentration instead (cross it out and write concentration if you like) and everything should become clearer. Honest. The Bohr Effect.","32":"@@@Introduction to Enzyme-Controlled Reactions and Measurement Techniques\nScience isn't all about words and theory; it's also about getting your pipette dirty and making bad smells (in the name of discovery of course). These pages show you how to measure the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction.\n\n@@@Measuring the Rate of Enzyme-Controlled Reactions with Oxygen Production\nYou can measure the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction. Here are two ways of measuring the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction: 1) You can measure how fast the product of the reaction is made. Catalase catalyses the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. It's easy to measure the volume of oxygen produced and to work out how fast it's given off. The diagram below shows the apparatus you'll need. The oxygen released displaces the water from the measuring cylinder. (A stand and clamp would also be pretty useful to hold the cylinder upside down, as would a stopwatch and a water bath.)\n\n@@@Step-by-Step Guide for Measuring Reaction Rate Using Catalase\nHere's how to carry out the experiment:\n1) Set up boiling tubes containing the same volume and concentration of hydrogen peroxide.\n2) To keep the pH constant, add equal volumes of a suitable buffer solution to each tube. (A buffer solution is able to resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or alkali are added.)\n3) Set up the rest of the apparatus as shown in the diagram.\n4) Put each boiling tube in a water bath set to a different temperature (e.g. 10 \u00b0C, 20 \u00b0C, 30 \u00b0C, and 40 \u00b0C) along with another tube containing catalase (wait 5 minutes before moving onto the next step so the enzyme gets up to temperature).\n5) Use a pipette to add the same volume and concentration of catalase to each boiling tube. Then quickly attach the bung and delivery tube.\n6) Record how much oxygen is produced in the first minute (60 s) of the reaction. Use a stopwatch to measure the time.\n7) Repeat the experiment at each temperature three times, and use the results to find an average volume of oxygen produced.\n8) Calculate the average rate of reaction at each temperature by dividing the volume of oxygen produced by the time taken (i.e. 60 s). The units will be cm3\/s.\nA negative control reaction, i.e., a boiling tube not containing catalase, should also be carried out at each temperature.\n\n@@@Measuring Reaction Rate by Substrate Breakdown with Amylase\n2) You can measure how fast the substrate is broken down. The enzyme amylase catalyses the breakdown of starch to maltose. The diagram shows how the experiment can be set up. You'll need the apparatus shown in the diagram as well as a stopwatch. A drop of iodine in potassium iodide is put into each well on a spotting tile. A known concentration of amylase and starch are then mixed together in a test tube. A dropping pipette is used to put a drop of this mixture into one of the wells containing the iodine solution on the spotting tile at regular intervals and the resulting color is observed. The iodine solution goes dark blue-black when starch is present but remains its normal browny-orange color when there's no starch around. You can see how fast amylase is working by recording how long it takes for the iodine solution to no longer turn blue-black when starch\/amylase mixture is added. Repeat the experiment using different concentrations of amylase. Make sure that you also repeat the experiment three times at each amylase concentration.\n\n@@@Investigating the Effects of Different Variables on Enzyme-Controlled Reactions\nThe experiments above show you how you can investigate the effects of temperature and enzyme concentration on the rate of enzyme-controlled reactions. You can also alter these experiments to investigate the effect of a different variable, such as pH (by adding a buffer solution with a different pH to each test tube) or substrate concentration (you could use serial dilutions to make substrate solutions with different concentrations). The key to experiments like this is to remember to only change one variable \u2014 everything else should stay the same.\n\n@@@Topic Summary: Biological Molecules\nTopic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules","33":"@@@Overview of the Circulatory System\nThe circulatory system, as the name suggests, is responsible for circulating substances throughout the body, particularly blood, which is essential for life. The system is indispensable in most multicellular organisms, including mammals, insects, and fish. Due to a low surface area to volume ratio, complex organisms require a specialized system to transport vital raw materials from special exchange organs to individual cells; this needs a cirulatory system comprised of the heart and various types of blood vessels. The circulatory system operates on two main circuits: one for directing blood from the heart to the lungs and back, and another for transporting it around the rest of the body. Not to be overlooked, the heart also has its own blood supply provided by the coronary arteries.\n\n@@@Structure and Function of Diverse Blood Vessels\nThe text describes the different types of vessels within the circulatory system, such as arteries, arterioles, and veins, each having unique features and roles. Arteries are robust and muscular, capable of maintaining high pressure necessary for delivering blood from the heart to the body. They further branch into arterioles, which regulate blood flow to various regions based on the body's demands. In contrast, veins are structured to transport blood back to the heart under low pressure, generally carrying deoxygenated blood except for the pulmonary veins, and they have valves to prevent backflow. Central to the exchange of substances are the capillaries, the smallest blood vessels, which facilitate the transfer of nutrients and gases between cells and blood.\n\n@@@Capillary Functions and the Formation of Tissue Fluid\nThe capillaries network into capillary beds within tissues to maximize the diffusion of necessary substances, such as glucose and oxygen, to cells. The proximity of capillaries to cells and their one-cell-thick walls optimize this diffusion. Tissue fluid is formed from blood plasma and surrounds tissue cells, providing them with nutrients and oxygen while receiving metabolic waste. The movement of substances in and out of capillaries and tissue fluid is governed by hydrostatic and osmotic pressure. Any surplus tissue fluid is collected by the lymphatic system and returned to the circulatory system.\n\n@@@Pathological Implications and Study Materials\nThe text also intimates that an imbalance in hydrostatic pressure can cause the accumulation of excess tissue fluid within tissues, a condition related to high blood pressure. This segment prepares students with practice and exam questions related to the circulatory system, asking them to name blood vessels, describe various types, explain fluid movements, and connect structural features of blood vessels to their functions. Lastly, a light-hearted personal anecdote remarks on transport efficiency and emphasizes the biological fascination with the interplay between structure and function, especially in veins, arteries, and capillaries.ss","34":"@@@Introduction to the Heart\nThe HeartAs I'm sure you know already, your heart is the 'pump' that gets oxygenated blood to your cells.

The volume of the atria and ventricles changes as they contract and relax. Pressure changes also occur, due to the changes in chamber volume (e.g. decreasing the volume of a chamber by contraction will increase the pressure in a chamber). The cardiac cycle can be simplified into three stages:\u00a9 ( Ventricles relax, atria contract )The ventricles are relaxed.The atria contract, decreasing the volume of the chambers and increasing the pressure inside the chambers. This pushes the blood into the ventricles.

Blood returns to the heart and the atria fill again due to the higher pressure in the vena cava and pulmonary vein. In turn this starts to increase the pressure of the atria. As the ventricles continue to relax, their pressure falls below the pressure of the atria and so the AV valves open.

This means the pressure is higher in the left ventricle (and in the aorta compared to the pulmonary artery).\n\nPractice Questions and an Exam Question are provided with the topics to test understanding, including questions about the sides of the heart carrying oxygenated blood, the purpose of the semi-lunar valves, and identifying blood vessels. Exam questions challenge students to use the data in a table showing blood pressure in two heart chambers at different times during part of the cardiac cycle, with specific questions related to AV valves, ventricular relaxation, and calculating percentage increase in left ventricle blood pressure.\n\nThe text concludes with a whimsical analogy comparing the cardiac cycle to a \"bewilderingly complicated pump-action bicycle,\" suggesting the importance of understanding the interplay of pressure and volume changes for exams.\n\nThe relevant topic section is \"Topic 3B \u2014 More Exchange and Transport Systems.\"","36":"@@@Introduction to Cardiovascular Disease\nDiseases associated with your heart and blood vessels are called cardiovascular diseases (cardio = heart, vascular = blood vessels \u2014 geddit?). There are certain factors that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.\n\n@@@Pathogenesis of Cardiovascular Disease: Atheroma Formation\nMost Cardiovascular Disease Starts with Atheroma Formation. The wall of an artery is made up of several layers (see p. 70). The endothelium (inner lining) is usually smooth and unbroken. If damage occurs to the endothelium (e.g., by high blood pressure) white blood cells (mostly macrophages) and lipids (fat) from the blood, clump together under the lining to form fatty streaks. Over time, more white blood cells, lipids and connective tissue build up and harden to form a fibrous plaque called an atheroma. This plaque partially blocks the lumen of the artery and restricts blood flow, which causes blood pressure to increase. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a type of cardiovascular disease. It occurs when the coronary arteries have lots of atheromas in them, which restricts blood flow to the heart muscle. It can lead to myocardial infarction (see below).\n\n@@@Complications of Atheroma: Aneurysm and Thrombosis\nAtheromas Increase the Risk of Aneurysm and Thrombosis. Two types of disease that affect the arteries are:\n\nAneurysm \u2014 a balloon-like swelling of the artery. Atheroma plaques damage and weaken arteries. They also narrow arteries, increasing blood pressure. When blood travels through a weakened artery at high pressure, it may push the inner layers of the artery through the outer elastic layer to form a balloon-like swelling \u2014 an aneurysm. This aneurysm may burst, causing a haemorrhage (bleeding).\n\nThrombosis \u2014 formation of a blood clot. An atheroma plaque can rupture (burst through) the endothelium (inner lining) of an artery. This damages the artery wall and leaves a rough surface. Platelets and fibrin (a protein) accumulate at the site of damage and form a blood clot (a thrombus). This blood clot can cause a complete blockage of the artery, or it can become dislodged and block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body. Debris from the rupture can cause another blood clot to form further down the artery.\n\n@@@Myocardial Infarction Due to Cardiovascular Disease\nInterrupted Blood Flow to the Heart can Cause a Myocardial Infarction. The heart muscle is supplied with blood by the coronary arteries. This blood contains the oxygen needed by heart muscle cells to carry out respiration. If a coronary artery becomes completely blocked (e.g., by a blood clot) an area of the heart muscle will be totally cut off from its blood supply, receiving no oxygen. This causes a myocardial infarction \u2014 more commonly known as a heart attack. A heart attack can cause damage and death of the heart muscle. Symptoms include pain in the chest and upper body, shortness of breath and sweating. If large areas of the heart are affected complete heart failure can occur, which is often fatal.\n\n@@@Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease\nSome Factors Increase the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease. Some of the most common risk factors for cardiovascular disease are:\n\nHigh blood cholesterol and poor diet. If the blood cholesterol level is high (above 240 mg per 100 cm3) then the risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. This is because cholesterol is one of the main constituents of the fatty deposits that form atheromas (see previous page). Atheromas can lead to increased blood pressure and blood clots. This could block the flow of blood to coronary arteries, which could cause a myocardial infarction (see previous page for details). A diet high in saturated fat is associated with high blood cholesterol levels. A diet high in salt also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease because it increases the risk of high blood pressure (see below).\n\nCigarette smoking. Both nicotine and carbon monoxide, found in cigarette smoke, increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Nicotine increases the risk of high blood pressure (see below). Carbon monoxide combines with haemoglobin and reduces the amount of oxygen transported in the blood, and so reduces the amount of oxygen available to tissues. If heart muscle doesn't receive enough oxygen it can lead to a heart attack (see previous page). Smoking also decreases the amount of antioxidants in the blood \u2014 these are important for protecting cells from damage. Fewer antioxidants means cell damage in the coronary artery walls is more likely, and this can lead to atheroma formation.\n\nHigh blood pressure. High blood pressure increases the risk of damage to the artery walls. Damaged walls have an increased risk of atheroma formation, causing a further increase in blood pressure. Atheromas can also cause blood clots to form (see previous page). A blood clot could block the flow of blood to the heart muscle, possibly resulting in myocardial infarction. So anything that increases blood pressure also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, e.g. being overweight, not exercising and excessive alcohol consumption. Other factors include age (risk increases with age) and sex (men are more at risk than women).\n\nMost of these factors are within our control \u2014 a person can choose to smoke, eat fatty foods, etc. However, some risk factors can't be controlled, such as having a genetic predisposition to coronary heart disease or having high blood pressure as a result of another condition, e.g. some forms of diabetes. Even so, the risk of developing cardiovascular disease can be reduced by removing as many risk factors as you possibly can.","37":"@@@Introduction to Lipids: Importance and Basic Composition\nLipids are really nice. Without them, we'd have no cell membranes. You owe it to them to make sure you can remember all of the stuff about them on these pages. It'll help you and your membranes get a good grade. Triglycerides are a Kind of Lipid Triglycerides have one molecule of glycerol with three fatty acids attached to it.\n\n@@@Structure of a Triglyceride and its Hydrophobic Nature\nStructure of a Triglyceride Fatty acid molecules have long tails made of hydrocarbons. The tails are 'hydrophobic' (they repel water molecules). These tails make lipids insoluble in water. All fatty acids have the same basic structure, but the hydrocarbon tail varies.

When the ester bond is formed, a molecule of water is released\u2014 it's a condensation reaction. This process happens twice more to form a triglyceride.\n\n@@@Properties of Fatty Acids: Saturated versus Unsaturated\nFatty Acids can be Saturated or Unsaturated There are two kinds of fatty acids \u2014 saturated and unsaturated. The difference is in their hydrocarbon tails (R group). Saturated fatty acids don't have any double bonds between their carbon atoms. Unsaturated fatty acids have at least one double bond between carbon atoms, which cause the chain to kink. Saturated hydrocarbon tail Unsaturated hydrocarbon tail\n\n@@@Phospholipids and their Role in Cell Membranes\nPhospholipids are Similar to Triglycerides 1) The lipids found in cell membranes aren't triglycerides\u2014 they're phospholipids. 2) Phospholipids are pretty similar to triglycerides except one of the fatty acid molecules is replaced by a phosphate group. 3) The phosphate group is hydrophilic (attracts water). The fatty acid tails are hydrophobic (repel water). This is important in the cell membrane (see next page to find out why). Structure of a Phospholipid\n\n@@@Functional Importance of Lipids and their Structures\nThe Structures of Lipids Relate to Their Functions You need to know how the structures of triglycerides and phospholipids are related to their functions: Triglycerides are mainly used as energy storage molecules. They're good for this because: 1) The long hydrocarbon tails of the fatty acids contain lots of chemical energy\u2014 a load of energy is released when they're broken down. Because of these tails, lipids contain about twice as much energy per gram as carbohydrates. 2) They're insoluble, so they don't affect the water potential (see p. 40) of the cell and cause water to enter the cells by osmosis (which would make them swell). The triglycerides clump together as insoluble droplets in cells because the fatty acid tails are hydrophobic (water-repelling) \u2014 the tails face inwards, shielding themselves from water with their glycerol heads. Phospholipids make up the bilayer of cell membranes (see p. 36). Cell membranes control what enters and leaves a cell. 1) Their heads are hydrophilic and their tails are hydrophobic, so they form a double layer with their heads facing out towards the water on either side. 2) The centre of the bilayer is hydrophobic, so water-soluble substances can't easily pass through it \u2014 the membrane acts as a barrier to those substances.\n\n@@@Testing for Lipids: The Emulsion Test\nUse the Emulsion Test for Lipids If you wanted to find out if there was any fat in a particular food you could do the emulsion test: 1) Shake the test substance with ethanol for about a minute so that it dissolves, then pour the solution into water. 2) Any lipid will show up as a milky emulsion. 3) The more lipid there is, the more noticeable the milky color will be. Test substance and ethanol Shake Add to water Milky color indicates lipid\n\n@@@Review and Application of Knowledge on Lipids\nPractice Questions Q1 What type of bond is made from a condensation reaction between glycerol and a fatty acid molecule?

[2 marks] The test for lipids \u2014 stick them in a can of paint... Not really. Otherwise you might upset your Biology teacher a bit. Instead, why not sit and contemplate all those phospholipids jumping around in your plasma membranes... their water-loving, phosphate heads poking out of the cell and into the cytoplasm, and their water-hating, hydrocarbon tails forming an impenetrable layer in between...","38":"@@@Understanding Cardiovascular Disease: Introduction and Atheroma Formation\nDiseases associated with your heart and blood vessels are called cardiovascular diseases (cardio = heart, vascular = blood vessels \u2014 geddit?). There are certain factors that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Most cardiovascular disease starts with atheroma formation. The wall of an artery is made up of several layers (see p. 70). The endothelium (inner lining) is usually smooth and unbroken. If damage occurs to the endothelium (e.g. by high blood pressure) white blood cells (mostly macrophages) and lipids (fat) from the blood, clump together under the lining to form fatty streaks. Over time, more white blood cells, lipids and connective tissue build up and harden to form a fibrous plaque called an atheroma. This plaque partially blocks the lumen of the artery and restricts blood flow, which causes blood pressure to increase. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a type of cardiovascular disease. It occurs when the coronary arteries have lots of atheromas in them, which restricts blood flow to the heart muscle. It can lead to myocardial infarction (see below).\n\n@@@Further Complications: Aneurysm and Thrombosis from Atheromas\nAtheromas increase the risk of aneurysm and thrombosis. An aneurysm is a balloon-like swelling of the artery, which can occur if atheroma plaques damage and weaken arteries, and also narrow them, increasing blood pressure. The increased pressure can push the inner layers of the artery through the outer elastic layer to form a balloon-like swelling \u2014 an aneurysm. If an aneurysm bursts, it can cause serious hemorrhage (bleeding). A thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot. An atheroma plaque can rupture the endothelium of an artery, damaging the wall and creating a rough surface where platelets and fibrin accumulate to form a clot. This thrombus can block the artery completely or dislodge and cause a blockage elsewhere in the body. Debris from the rupture can also lead to further blood clots.\n\n@@@Myocardial Infarction: Blood Flow Interruption and its Effects\nInterrupted blood flow to the heart can lead to a myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack. The coronary arteries supply the heart muscle with oxygenated blood for respiration. A complete blockage in a coronary artery can cut off the blood supply to part of the heart muscle, leading to the death of that tissue\u2014a myocardial infarction. Symptoms can include chest pain, shortness of breath, and sweating. In severe cases, where large areas of the heart are affected, complete heart failure can occur, which is often fatal.\n\n@@@Risk Factors and Lifestyle Choices Influencing Cardiovascular Disease\nSome factors that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease include high blood cholesterol and poor diet, which contribute to atheroma formation and therefore increase the risk of high blood pressure and blood clots. A diet high in saturated fat and salt also increases these risks. Cigarette smoking introduces nicotine and carbon monoxide, which impair cardiovascular health by increasing blood pressure and reducing oxygen transportation. High blood pressure alone can lead to artery wall damage and atheroma formation. Age, sex, genetic predisposition, and conditions like diabetes are additional risk factors, though lifestyle choices and managing controllable risk factors can mitigate some of the risks.\n\n@@@Interpreting Data on Risk Factors and Cardiovascular Disease\nEvaluating studies on cardiovascular risk factors is crucial. For example, analyzing the data from a study involving 27,939 American women showed that the relative risk of a cardiovascular event increases with higher LDL cholesterol levels. However, drawing valid conclusions requires looking at the study design, sample size, and variables considered. Conflicting evidence from different studies might exist, and resolving these conflicts often necessitates further research. Data from large populations and good study designs provide stronger evidence, while things like self-reported questionnaires can introduce unreliability.\n\n@@@Learning and Application: Studies on Cardiovascular Risk and Revision Tips\nUnderstanding how to interpret and evaluate studies is an essential skill. For instance, knowing how to assess the strength of evidence from a study involving 168,000 people from 63 countries, which found a correlation between waist measurement and cardiovascular disease, is critical. When revising, it's important to grasp the connections between atheromas, thrombosis, and heart attacks, recognizing that lifestyle factors such as diet and smoking can exacerbate the risks associated with cardiovascular diseases.","39":"@@@Introduction to Transport in Plants and the Role of Xylem\nTransport in Plants \u2014 Xylem: Transport in plants isn't really roads and railways, but I guess it's a bit like a flowing river that's carrying stuff around in a network of tubes. When you consider the movement of water, it's all about the xylem. It's pretty exciting stuff.\n\n@@@Tissue Types Involved in Plant Transport\nTwo Types of Tissue are Involved in Transport in Plants: 1) Xylem tissue transports water and mineral ions in solution. These substances move up the plant from the roots to the leaves. 2) Phloem tissue transports organic substances like sugars (also in solution) both up and down the plant \u2014 there's more about the phloem on pages 80-81. 3) Xylem and phloem are mass transport systems (see page 54) \u2014 they move substances over large distances.\n\n@@@Structure and Function of Xylem Vessels\nXylem vessels are the part of the xylem tissue that actually transports the water and ions. Xylem vessels are very long, tube-like structures formed from dead cells (vessel elements) joined end to end. There are no end walls on these cells, making an uninterrupted tube that allows water to pass up through the middle easily.\n\n@@@Mechanism of Water Movement in Plants\nWater Moves Up a Plant Against the Force of Gravity: Cohesion and tension help water move up plants, from roots to leaves, against the force of gravity. 1) Water evaporates from the leaves at the 'top' of the xylem (this is transpiration \u2014 see below). 2) This creates tension (suction), which pulls more water into the leaf. 3) Water molecules are cohesive (they stick together \u2014 see page 21) so when some are pulled into the leaf others follow. 4) Water enters the stem through the roots.\n\n@@@Transpiration and Its Role in Plants\nTranspiration is Loss of Water from a Plant\u2019s Surface: Transpiration is the evaporation of water from a plant's surface, especially the leaves. 1) Water evaporates from the moist cell walls and accumulates in the spaces between cells in the leaf. 2) When the stomata open (see page 57), it moves out of the leaf down the concentration gradient (there's more water inside the leaf than in the air outside).\n\n@@@Factors Influencing Transpiration\nFour Main Factors Affect Transpiration Rate: 1) Light \u2014 the lighter it is the faster the transpiration rate (i.e., there's a positive correlation between light intensity and transpiration rate). 2) Temperature \u2014 the higher the temperature the faster the transpiration rate. 3) Humidity \u2014 the lower the humidity, the faster the transpiration rate (i.e., there's a negative correlation between humidity and transpiration rate). 4) Wind \u2014 the windier it is, the faster the transpiration rate.\n\n@@@Measuring Transpiration with a Potometer\nTransport in Plants \u2014 Xylem: A Potometer can be Used to Estimate Transpiration Rate: A potometer is a special piece of apparatus used to estimate transpiration rates. It actually measures water uptake by a plant but it's assumed that water uptake by the plant is directly related to water loss by the leaves.\n\n@@@Procedures for Using a Potometer\nProcedure for Using a Potometer: Here's what you'd do: 1) Cut a shoot underwater to prevent air from entering the xylem. 2) Assemble the potometer in water and insert the shoot underwater. 3) Remove the apparatus from the water but keep the end of the capillary tube submerged. 4) Dry the leaves, shut the tap, and record the starting position of the air bubble. 5) Start a stopwatch and record the distance moved by the bubble per unit time.\n\n@@@Studying Plant Tissues: Dissection and Microscopy\nYou Might Have to Dissect Plants: To examine plant tissues such as xylem or phloem under a microscope, one must follow a meticulous process that involves cutting a cross-section of the stem and then preparing the section of the tissue using stains and mounting it onto a slide.\n\n@@@Review and Examination Techniques\nPractice Examination Questions: End of the chapter includes practice and exam-style questions to test the understanding of the function of xylem tissue, factors affecting transpiration rate, and methods used to measure the transpiration rate like the potometer.\n\n@@@Xylem's Significance and a Touch of Humor\nConclusion and Levity: The section concludes by emphasizing the importance of xylem for water transport in plants, culminating in a note that xylem should not be confused with Wylam, a small village in Northumberland, adding a light-hearted touch to the educational content.","40":"@@@Introduction to Transport in Plants \u2014 Phloem Function and Adaptations\nTransport in plants plays a crucial role in their survival and growth. Phloem tissue, distinct from xylem, is specialized in the movement of dissolved organic substances such as sugars and amino acids. The structure of phloem tissue facilitates this transport, where critical cell types include sieve tube elements and companion cells. Sieve tube elements, living cells forming the transport tubes, lack a nucleus and contain minimal organelles to maximize solute movement. Companion cells play a supportive role for sieve tube elements by managing metabolic processes necessary for active transport. \n\n@@@Mechanism of Solutes Movement \u2014 Translocation\nTranslocation, the energy-dependent process in which solutes are transferred from a source (where solutes are created) to a sink (where they're utilized), is fundamental to plant health and development. Sources typically are the photosynthetically active leaves, and sinks include areas of growth and storage organs. Enzymatic activity ensures a concentration gradient is maintained between these points to facilitate constant solute movement. Sucrose, a common solute, is often converted into other substances like starch at sink locations to perpetuate this gradient.\n\n@@@The Mass Flow Hypothesis \u2014 The Theoretical Framework for Phloem Transport\nOur understanding of how phloem transports solutes is encapsulated in the mass flow hypothesis, which proposes a mechanism based on pressure gradients facilitated by water potential differences. Solutes are actively loaded into the phloem at the source, lowering the water potential therein. This osmotically drives water into the sieve tubes from the xylem and companion cells, creating pressure. At the sink, solutes are removed, water potential increases, and pressure reduces, resulting in water leaving the tubes. The differential pressures propel solutes through the phloem, with numerous experiments indicating varying solute movement strategies, including through cell walls.\n\n@@@Evaluating Evidence For and Against the Mass Flow Hypothesis\nDiverse experiments have been conducted to understand and validate the mass flow model. Among these, observing the effects of bark removal; utilizing radioactive tracers; studying phloem pressure with aphids, and the impact of metabolic inhibitors promote comprehension of this complex process. While evidence supports the model of mass transport, anomalies challenge its comprehensiveness. Issues like the difficulty of solute movement through sieve plates and solute distribution not strictly following water potential suggest that our models could evolve with new data and insights.\n\n@@@Experimental Demonstration of the Translocation of Solutes\nExperimental techniques, particularly using radioactive tracers, have been developed to demonstrate and analyze the movement of solutes within plants. By providing a radioactively labeled substance to a part of the plant, its subsequent incorporation into sugars and amino acids, and their redistribution can be observed using autoradiography. Images produced from this process illustrate the dynamic nature of translocation over time, from the leaves\u2014the production sites\u2014toward various sinks, such as roots and fruits.\n\n@@@Practical Applications and Understanding of the Mass Flow Hypothesis\nStudents of plant biology must not only understand the theory behind phloem transport but also the application of this knowledge. Practice questions aim to reinforce the principles of the mass flow hypothesis, such as establishing pressure gradients, and the actual movement paths of photosynthesis products. These theories aptly describe our current understanding, yet they remain scientific models, subject to change with new evidence and research advancements. In the broader context of transport within living organisms, the mass flow concept serves as a fundamental framework that may extend and modify itself as scientific investigation continues.","41":"@@@Introduction to DNA, Genes, and Chromosomes\n82 Topic 4 begins with a lighthearted reference to DNA\u2019s impact on personal traits, then moves on to explain how DNA is responsible for coding our genetic information and the differences in DNA storage between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. This section introduces the subject matter related to DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, promising to provide detailed information on the packaging of DNA, what genes are, and their role in coding for proteins and other molecules.\n\n@@@DNA Storage in Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Cells\nDNA is universally structured among organisms, but there is a notable difference in the way it is stored between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. In eukaryotic cells, including both animal and plant cells, DNA is linear and interacts with proteins. DNA molecules exist as chromosomes found in the cell nucleus. They are made thread-like by being wound around histone proteins and further coiled to form compact chromosomes. The mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells possess their own DNA, circular in shape and not bound to histones, similar to the DNA in prokaryotic cells. On the other hand, prokaryotic cells, primarily bacteria, contain shorter and circular DNA chromosomes that supercoil to fit within the cell structure.\n\n@@@The Function and Composition of Genes\nGenes are sequences of DNA bases coding for either polypeptides or functional RNA. They determine the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide, thereby dictating the protein's primary structure. This sequence is determined by the order of triplet bases in DNA. Furthermore, genes can code for functional RNA molecules, such as tRNA and rRNA, which are essential for protein synthesis. This section also introduces concepts like the genome, which is the complete set of a cell's genes, and the proteome, which is the full range of proteins a cell can produce.\n\n@@@Genetic Coding and Variation in Eukaryotes\n83 The discussion extends to nuances in eukaryotic DNA, emphasizing that most DNA does not encode polypeptides but may code for functional RNA. Details about introns and exons within the genes are provided, explaining that introns, the non-coding sections, are removed during protein synthesis, while exons which do code for amino acids are spliced together. Eukaryotic DNA also contains non-coding repeats, regions outside of genes that have repetitive sequences. Additionally, this subsection covers genome variation through alleles, which are different forms of a gene coding for variants of a polypeptide, influencing characteristics such as blood type. Essential genetic concepts are iterated, inclusive of the organization of chromosomes in homologous pairs within a cell nucleus, the position of alleles at a specific locus, and the implication of these allelic differences.\n\n@@@Practice and Exam Questions\nIn a didactic conclusion, readers are presented with practice questions aiming to reinforce concepts such as DNA triplets, introns, non-coding repeats, and loci. Exam questions task readers with describing eukaryotic DNA storage and calculating the number of amino acids in a polypeptide section based on exon and intron lengths within a DNA sequence. These assessments are designed to ensure understanding and retention of the material presented within the topic, with a focus on the importance of introns and exons in genetic coding.","42":"@@@Overview of RNA and Protein Synthesis\nProtein synthesis involves two stages \u2014 transcription and translation. They both involve RNA. RNA is a single polynucleotide strand and it contains uracil (U) as a base instead of thymine (see p. 16). Uracil always pairs with adenine during protein synthesis. There are different types of RNA, each serving a distinct role in the process of protein synthesis.\n\n@@@Types of RNA\nThere are several types of RNA to be aware of:\n- Messenger RNA (mRNA) is created during transcription. It carries the genetic code from DNA to the ribosomes, where it is utilized in protein assembly during translation. mRNA consists of groups of three adjacent bases, known as codons.\n- Transfer RNA (tRNA) is involved in translation. It transports the amino acids to the ribosomes, where they are linked to form proteins. tRNA has a specific structure, which includes a cloverleaf shape due to intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Every tRNA molecule has an anticodon at one end and an amino acid binding site at the other.\n\n@@@Transcription: The First Stage of Protein Synthesis\nTranscription is the process where an mRNA copy of a gene is made. This occurs within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, or in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells since they lack a nucleus. The process starts with RNA polymerase binding to DNA and initiating the mRNA synthesis by transcribing one strand of the DNA. The strands of DNA separate and nucleotide pairing occurs, where uracil replaces the thymine from DNA. The mRNA is formed and processed before it leaves the nucleus via a nuclear pore to the cytoplasm, where it is ready for translation.\n\n@@@RNA and Protein Synthesis Differences Between Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes\nThe transcription process results in different intermediate products in eukaryotes compared to prokaryotes. In eukaryotes, initially, both introns and exons are copied into pre-mRNA, which is then spliced to remove the introns, resulting in mature mRNA. In prokaryotes, the mRNA is synthesized directly from DNA without a splicing process as prokaryotic DNA does not contain introns.\n\n@@@Translation: The Second Stage of Protein Synthesis\nDuring translation, which occurs at the ribosomes, amino acids are linked together to form a protein, following the sequence coded by the mRNA. The mRNA attaches to a ribosome, tRNA brings in amino acids, and through a sequence of base pairing and peptide bond formation, a polypeptide chain grows until a stop signal on the mRNA is reached, marking the end of the protein synthesis.\n\n@@@Assessment and Summary Questions\nThe text includes a set of practice questions and an exam question to encourage understanding and retention of the material covered:\n- The structure of tRNA and the site of transcription in eukaryotes are used as practice questions to reinforce learning.\n- An exam question describes a scenario in which a drug that inhibits cell growth binds to DNA and interferes with RNA polymerase, asking for an explanation on how this would affect protein synthesis.\n\nThe final paragraph refers to the reader's need to understand the detailed process of protein synthesis, using a lighthearted tone to suggest various methods to memorize the information. It emphasizes the complexity and significance of protein synthesis and indirectly motivates the reader to appreciate the biological details involved.","43":"@@@Enzyme-Controlled Reactions: Measuring the Reaction Rate\n\nScience isn't all about words and theory; it's also about getting your pipette dirty and making bad smells (in the name of discovery, of course). These pages show you how to measure the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction. You can measure the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction. Here are two ways of measuring the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction: \n\n1) You Can Measure How Fast the Product of the Reaction is Made\nCatalase catalyses the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. It's easy to measure the volume of oxygen produced and to work out how fast it's given off. The diagram below shows the apparatus you'll need. The oxygen released displaces the water from the measuring cylinder. (A stand and clamp would also be pretty useful to hold the cylinder upside down, as would a stopwatch and a water bath.)\n\nHere's how to carry out the experiment:\n1) Set up boiling tubes containing the same volume and concentration of hydrogen peroxide.\n2) To keep the pH constant, add equal volumes of a suitable buffer solution to each tube. (A buffer solution is able to resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or alkali are added.)\n3) Set up the rest of the apparatus as shown in the diagram.\n4) Put each boiling tube in a water bath set to a different temperature (e.g. 10 \u00b0C, 20 \u00b0C, 30 \u00b0C, and 40 \u00b0C) along with another tube containing catalase (wait 5 minutes before moving onto the next step so the enzyme gets up to temperature).\n5) Use a pipette to add the same volume and concentration of catalase to each boiling tube. Then quickly attach the bung and delivery tube.\n6) Record how much oxygen is produced in the first minute (60 s) of the reaction. Use a stopwatch to measure the time.\n7) Repeat the experiment at each temperature three times, and use the results to find an average volume of oxygen produced.\n\nCalculate the average rate of reaction at each temperature by dividing the volume of oxygen produced by the time taken (i.e., 60 s). The units will be cm\u00b3\/s. A negative control reaction, i.e., a boiling tube not containing catalase, should also be carried out at each temperature.\n\n2) You Can Measure How Fast the Substrate is Broken Down\nThe enzyme amylase catalyses the breakdown of starch to maltose. The diagram shows how the experiment can be set up. You'll need the apparatus shown in the diagram as well as a stopwatch. \n\nA drop of iodine in potassium iodide is put into each well on a spotting tile. A known concentration of amylase and starch are then mixed together in a test tube. A dropping pipette is used to put a drop of this mixture into one of the wells containing the iodine solution on the spotting tile at regular intervals and the resulting color is observed. The iodine solution goes dark blue-black when starch is present but remains its normal browny-orange color when there's no starch around. You can see how fast amylase is working by recording how long it takes for the iodine solution to no longer turn blue-black when starch\/amylase mixture is added. Repeat the experiment using different concentrations of amylase. Make sure that you also repeat the experiment three times at each amylase concentration.\n\nThe experiments above show you how you can investigate the effects of temperature and enzyme concentration on the rate of enzyme-controlled reactions. You can also alter these experiments to investigate the effect of a different variable, such as pH (by adding a buffer solution with a different pH to each test tube) or substrate concentration (you could use serial dilutions to make substrate solutions with different concentrations). The key to experiments like this is to remember to only change one variable \u2014 everything else should stay the same.\n\n@@@Interpreting Graphs of Enzyme-Controlled Reactions\n\nYou need to be able to interpret graphs of enzyme-controlled reactions. The results of enzyme-controlled reactions are usually shown in line graphs. You might be asked to interpret the graph of an enzyme-controlled reaction in the exam. The graph below shows the release of a product over time for reactions conducted at different temperatures. First, look at the start of the graph and compare the rates of reaction here. E.g., the rate of reaction is fastest at 65\u00b0C. Use what you know about factors affecting enzyme activity to explain why (see p. 12). You might have to work out the initial rate of reaction (see below).\n\nNow, look at what else the graphs are showing you and make comparisons between the different temperatures. At 37\u00b0C the graph has plateaued (flattened out) because all the substrates have been used up. At 65\u00b0C the graph has plateaued earlier than at 37\u00b0C, because the high temperature caused the enzyme to denature, so the reaction stopped sooner. Not as much product was made because not all the substrates were converted to product before the enzyme was denatured, so there is still substrate left. At 25\u00b0C the rate of reaction is remaining constant and the volume of product is continuing to increase because not all of the substrates have been used up.\n\nYou Can Use a Tangent to Calculate the Initial Rate of Reaction\nThe initial rate of reaction is the rate of reaction right at the start of the reaction, close to time equals zero (t = 0) on the graph. To work out the initial rate of reaction, carry out the following steps:\n\n1) Draw a tangent to the curve at t = 0, using a ruler. Do this by positioning the ruler so it's an equal distance from the curve at both sides of where it's touching it. Here you'll have to estimate where the curve would continue if it carried on below zero. Then draw a line along the ruler. (For more on drawing tangents see p. 212.)\n2) Then calculate the gradient of the tangent \u2014 this is the initial rate of reaction. Gradient = change in the y-axis\/change in x-axis. In this graph, it's: 40 cm\u00b3\/8 s = 5 cm\u00b3\/s.\n\nIf you're comparing the initial rate of reaction for two different reactions, you can work out the ratio of the rates to give you a quick and easy comparison. \n\nPractice Question\nYou are testing the effects of pH on the action of an enzyme. What other variables must you keep constant?\n\nExam Question\nQ1: A student carries out an enzyme-controlled reaction at 37\u00b0C and 65\u00b0C.\nHer results are shown in the graph above.\nDraw a tangent to find the initial rate of reaction at 65\u00b0C. Show your working. [1 mark]\n\nMy rate of reaction depends on what time of day it is... In your exam, you could get asked about methods used to measure the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction or to calculate the rate from a graph. It's worth your time to memorize the examples and learn the math on these pages.","44":"@@@The Genetic Code and Nucleic Acids: Characteristics and Interpretation\nThe genetic code is exactly as it sounds\u2014a code found in your genes that tells your body how to make proteins. It can be interpreted, just like any other code, which is exactly what you might have to do in your exam. The Genetic Code is non-overlapping, degenerate, and universal. 1) The genetic code is the sequence of base triplets (codons) in mRNA which code for specific amino acids. 2) In the genetic code, each base triplet is read in sequence, separate from the triplet before it and after it. Base triplets don't share their bases\u2014the code is non-overlapping. Order of bases on mRNA: Base triplet (codon), Code read in sequence, mRNA base triplet, Amino acid, Order of amino acids in a protein, UCA = (serine). 3) The genetic code is also degenerate\u2014there are more possible combinations of triplets than there are amino acids (20 amino acids but 64 possible triplets). This means that some amino acids are coded for by more than one base triplet, e.g. tyrosine can be coded for by UAU or UAC. 4) Some triplets are used to tell the cell when to start and stop production of the protein\u2014these are called start and stop signals (or codons). They're found at the beginning and end of the mRNA. E.g., UAG is a stop signal. 5) The genetic code is also universal\u2014the same specific base triplets code for the same amino acids in all living things. E.g., UAU codes for tyrosine in all organisms.\n\n@@@How to Interpret Data about Nucleic Acids\nYou need to be able to interpret data about nucleic acids. The table on the right shows the mRNA codons (triplets) for some amino acids. You might have to interpret information like this in the exam. For example, using the table, you could be asked to give the DNA sequence for amino acids. The mRNA codons for the amino acids are given in the table. Because mRNA is a complementary copy of the DNA template, the DNA sequence for each amino acid is made up of bases that would pair with the mRNA sequence: mRNA codon, Amino Acid, DNA sequence (of the template strand), UCU (Serine) - AGA, CUA (Leucine) - GAT, etc. You could also be asked to work out the amino acids from a given DNA sequence and a table, write the amino acid sequence for a section of mRNA, or give the tRNA anticodons from mRNA codons. When interpreting data on nucleic acids, remember that DNA contains T and RNA contains U. To work out the sequence of amino acids from some mRNA, you need to break the genetic code into codons and then use the information in the table to work out what amino acid they code for. Sequence of mRNA: From mRNA: Codons: Amino acids (Example: Leucine, Valine, Arginine, Tyrosine, Serine).\n\n@@@Investigating the Role of Nucleic Acids in Protein Synthesis\nIn the exam, you might have to interpret data from experiments done to investigate nucleic acids and their role in protein synthesis. Here's an example (you don't need to learn it): Investigating the effect of new drugs on nucleic acids: 1) To investigate how two new drugs affect nucleic acids and their role in protein synthesis, bacteria were grown in normal conditions for a few generations, then moved to media containing the drugs. 2) After a short period of time, the concentration of protein and complete strands of mRNA in the bacteria were analyzed. The results are shown in the bar graph. 3) Both mRNA and protein concentration were lower in the presence of drug 1 compared to the no-drug control. This suggests that drug 1 affects the production of full-length mRNA, so there's no mRNA for protein synthesis during translation. 4) mRNA production in the presence of drug 2 was unaffected, but less protein was produced. This suggests that drug 2 interferes with translation. mRNA was produced, but less protein was translated from it. 5) Further tests to establish the nature of the two drugs were carried out. Drug 1 was found to be a ribonuclease. Drug 2 was found to be a single-stranded, clover-shaped molecule capable of binding to the ribosome. 6) A molecule capable of binding to mRNA would have had a similar effect to drug 1 since it would have prevented mRNA from being read by the ribosomes and stopped it from being translated.\n\n@@@Practice and Exam Questions on the Genetic Code\nPractice Questions include mRNA codon and amino acid correlation, such as UGU (Cysteine), CGC (Arginine), etc. Example exam questions are provided to assess understanding of the genetic code, degeneracy, and universality, along with questions requiring translation of mRNA sequences and interpretation of results based on codon information. The key to the genetic code is to be able to interpret it, so knowledge of how DNA, mRNA, and tRNA work together to make a protein is essential for handling genetic code-related data. Remember DNA to RNA base pairing details such as C with C, and A with T (or U in the case of RNA).","45":"@@@Meiosis and Genetic Variation: The Basics\nTopic 4B \u2014 Diversity, Classification and Variation introduces the exciting concept of gametes\u2014the sex cells referred to as sperm in males and eggs in females. These are crucial in sexual reproduction because they combine during fertilization to form a zygote, which then divides and develops into a new organism. Normal body cells contain a diploid number of chromosomes, which means there are two sets\u2014one from each parent. However, gametes differ as they have a haploid number, just a single set of chromosomes. When a sperm fuses with an egg at fertilization, the resulting cell restores the normal diploid number, with equal contributions from both parents. This fusion not only blends parental DNA but also introduces genetic variation due to the random nature of fertilization, leading to offspring with different chromosomal combinations than their parents, thus increasing genetic diversity within a species.\n\n@@@Meiosis: An Essential Process for Producing Gametes\nMeiosis, a process occurring in the reproductive organs, reduces chromosome numbers by half to produce haploid cells from diploid ones. This halving is crucial to prevent doubling the chromosome count when gametes fuse. Meiosis involves DNA replication, forming chromatids, and two divisions\u2014Meiosis I and Meiosis II. During Meiosis I, homologous chromosome pairs separate, and Meiosis II sees the splitting of sister chromatids, resulting in four genetically distinct haploid gametes. Knowing when and where meiosis occurs in various life cycles is important for understanding sexual reproduction in different organisms. The concept of homologous chromosome pairs is particularly poignant in humans, who have 23 such pairs, each containing one chromosome from each parent. Although these chromosomes carry the same genes, the alleles\u2014different versions of those genes\u2014may vary, providing further genetic diversity.\n\n@@@Chromatid Exchange and Independent Segregation: Sources of Genetic Variation\nDuring Meiosis I, a process called crossing over occurs where homologous chromosomes pair and exchange chromatid segments, leading to new allele combinations which create genetic diversity. Moreover, meiosis promotes variation through the random assortment of maternal and paternal chromosomes into gametes, known as independent segregation. This shuffling of genetic material results in daughter cells with unique combinations of chromosomes, further enriching genetic diversity. These two mechanisms are critical to the unique genetic outcomes for potential offspring.\n\n@@@Contrasting Meiosis with Mitosis: Understanding Different Cell Division Outcomes\nContrasting meiosis with mitosis, which was discussed on page 32, highlights distinct differences in outcomes. In mitosis, a single cell division creates two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell, maintaining the same chromosome number. Meiosis, on the other hand, involves two division stages leading to four daughter cells that are genetically diverse and contain half the chromosomes of the parent cell. The absence of homologous chromosome pairing, crossing over, and independent segregation in mitosis accounts for the identical genetic makeup of daughter cells and differs significantly from the genetic variety produced by meiosis. Understanding these differences is fundamental when explaining the outcomes of these two forms of cell division.","46":"@@@Topic Overview: Diversity, Classification and Variation\nTopic 4B dives into the intricacies of diversity, classification, and variation within organisms. This is primarily explored through the processes of meiosis and genetic variation, which are integral to sexual reproduction and the subsequent genetic uniqueness of individuals.\n\n@@@Meiosis and Genetic Variation: Introduction\nAhh, now on to some really exciting stuff \u2014 the production of gametes (sex cells to you and me). This is how we end up different from our parents and our siblings \u2014 and yet, in some ways, strangely alike... DNA from one generation is passed to the next by gametes. Gametes are the sperm cells in males and egg cells in females. They join together at fertilization to form a zygote, which divides and develops into a new organism. Normal body cells have the diploid number (2n) of chromosomes \u2014 meaning each cell contains two of each chromosome, one from the mum and one from the dad. Gametes have a haploid (n) number of chromosomes \u2014 there's only one copy of each chromosome. At fertilization, a haploid sperm fuses with a haploid egg, making a cell with the normal diploid number of chromosomes. Half these chromosomes are from the father (the sperm) and half are from the mother (the egg). During sexual reproduction, any sperm can fertilize any egg. Fertilization is random and produces zygotes with different combinations of chromosomes to both parents. This mixing of genetic material in sexual reproduction increases genetic diversity within a species.\n\n@@@The Process of Forming Gametes by Meiosis\nMeiosis is a type of cell division that occurs in the reproductive organs. Diploid cells undergo meiosis to produce haploid gametes, ensuring that, upon fertilization, the resultant zygote maintains the species' specific chromosome number rather than doubling it. The steps of meiosis include DNA replication, chromosome condensation into homologous pairs, separation of these pairs during Meiosis I, and division of sister chromatids during Meiosis II, resulting in four genetically unique haploid cells. Understanding meiosis is crucial for recognizing its occurrence across various organisms' life cycles and predicting chromosomal compositions in offspring. This section also explains the concept of homologous chromosome pairs in humans, which consist of 46 chromosomes total, 23 from each parent.\n\n@@@Increased Genetic Variation through Meiosis\nTwo critical events in meiosis-I lead to genetic variation: crossing over and independent segregation. During meiosis-I, homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange segments, resulting in chromatids with new allele combinations. Additionally, the random separation of these homologous chromosomes into daughter cells during meiosis-I ensures varied combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes, contributing to genetic diversity. Meiosis produces genetically distinct cells, unlike mitosis, which results in identical daughter cells. This distinction is vital for genetic diversity, evident in sexual reproduction, while mitosis is essential for growth and tissue repair.\n\n@@@Chromosome Mutations and Disorders\nChromosome mutations can occur during cell division when meiosis malfunctions, causing daughter cells to have additional or missing chromosomes or chromosome parts. This can lead to inherited conditions, exemplified by non-disjunction, where chromosomes fail to separate correctly. For instance, non-disjunction of chromosome 21 can result in Down's Syndrome, characterized by an extra copy of chromosome 21 in the affected individual. Similarly, Turner syndrome in females is explained by non-disjunction of sex chromosomes leading to a single X chromosome instead of two.\n\n@@@Practical Implementation and Exam Preparation\nPractice and exam questions regarding topics like haploid and diploid concepts, meiosis mechanics, and outcomes of meiosis versus mitosis are provided to solidify the understanding of the subject. These questions aim to test the ability to define terms, explain processes, and apply knowledge to new scenarios such as non-human organisms. Such exercises prepare students for higher-level explorations of the topic and reinforce the core concepts explained throughout the text.\n\n@@@Final Thoughts\nReproduction may not be as thrilling as it's portrayed to be, but understanding it is crucial for appreciating biological diversity. The processes of crossing over and independent segregation during meiosis are central to generating genetic variation and the subsequent richness of life. Diagrams and explanations throughout this section serve to demystify these complex processes and emphasize their importance in the continuity and evolution of life forms.","47":"@@@Introduction to Photosynthesis\nRight, pen at the ready.

They are found in plant cells.\n2) Thylakoids (fluid-filled sacs) are stacked up in the chloroplast into structures called grana (singular = granum). The grana are linked together by bits of thylakoid membrane called lamellae (singular = lamella).\n4) Chloroplasts contain photosynthetic pigments (e.g. chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotene). These are coloured substances that absorb the light energy needed for photosynthesis. The pigments are found in the thylakoid membranes \u2014 they're attached to proteins. The protein and pigment is called a photosystem.\n5) There are two photosystems used by plants to capture light energy. Photosystem I (or PSI) absorbs light best at a wavelength of 700 nm and photosystem II (PSII) absorbs light best at 680 nm.\n6) Contained within the inner membrane of the chloroplast and surrounding the thylakoids is a gel-like substance called the stroma.

The light energy excites the electrons in the chlorophyll, leading to their eventual release from the molecule. The chlorophyll has been photoionised.\n4) Some of the energy from the released electrons is used to add a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP, and some is used to reduce NADP to form reduced NADP. ATP transfers energy and reduced NADP transfers hydrogen to the light-independent reaction.\n5) During the process H2O is oxidised to O2.\nThe Light-Independent Reaction\n1) This is also called the Calvin cycle and as the name suggests it doesn't use light energy directly.

This reaction is called photophosphorylation (see p. 105).\n2) Making reduced NADP from NADP.\n3) Splitting water into protons (H+ ions), electrons and oxygen. This is called photolysis (see p. 105).\nThe light-dependent reaction actually includes two types of photophosphorylation \u2014 non-cyclic and cyclic. Each of these processes has different products (see next page).\n\n@@@Details on Photophosphorylation: Non-Cyclic and Cyclic\nNon-cyclic Photophosphorylation Produces ATP, Reduced NADP and O2\nTo understand the process you need to know that the photosystems (in the thylakoid membranes) are linked by electron carriers. Electron carriers are proteins that transfer electrons. The photosystems and electron carriers form an electron transport chain \u2014 a chain of proteins through which excited electrons flow. All the processes in the diagrams are happening together \u2014 I've just split them up to make it easier to understand.\n1) Light energy excites electrons in chlorophyll jLight energy is absorbed by PSII.

This reaction also requires H+ ions, which come from reduced NADP (also from the light-dependent reaction). Reduced NADP is recycled to NADP.

Topic 5A \u2014 Photosynthesis and Respiration","48":"@@@Introduction to Respiration\nRespiration is a fundamental process that you, along with many other living organisms, engage in to produce energy. This text will guide you through the intricate reactions involved in respiration. You'll be introduced to two primary types of respiration: aerobic, which requires oxygen, and anaerobic, which does not require oxygen. Both pathways begin with glycolysis, a process through which glucose is converted into pyruvate, setting the stage for either aerobic or anaerobic respiration.\n\n@@@Overview of Glycolysis and Pyruvate Formation\nThe process of glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm and involves the breakdown of glucose (a 6-carbon molecule) into two molecules of pyruvate (each with 3 carbons). This process occurs without the need for oxygen, thus being an anaerobic process, and results in a net gain of ATP and reduced NAD. Glycolysis itself can be broken down into two stages: phosphorylation and oxidation. Through these stages, ATP and reduced NAD are generated, and pyruvate, a crucial molecule for the subsequent pathways, is produced.\n\n@@@Distinguishing Aerobic and Anaerobic Respiration\nIn aerobic respiration, the generated pyruvate is transported into the mitochondrial matrix, where it undergoes further reactions. These include the link reaction, which converts pyruvate into acetyl coenzyme A, and the Krebs cycle, which produces additional energy carriers. During anaerobic respiration, pyruvate is not transported to the mitochondria but instead is converted to either ethanol or lactate, allowing for the continuation of glycolysis and a small but critical production of ATP.\n\n@@@Further Stages of Aerobic Respiration: Link Reaction and Krebs Cycle\nThe aerobic respiration process continues with the link reaction, where pyruvate is converted into acetyl coenzyme A, and then enters the Krebs cycle. The Krebs cycle is a set of reactions that take place in the mitochondria, involving further decarboxylation and dehydrogenation. The Krebs cycle turns twice for each glucose molecule and generates reduced coenzymes and ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation.\n\n@@@Oxidative Phosphorylation and ATP Production\nOxidative phosphorylation is the final stage of aerobic respiration where considerable amounts of ATP are produced. This stage encompasses the electron transport chain and chemiosmosis, which use the energy derived from reduced coenzymes to synthesize ATP. Specifically, protons are pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane and their subsequent flow back into the matrix via ATP synthase generates ATP. Oxygen serves as the final electron acceptor in the chain.\n\n@@@Efficiency of Aerobic Respiration and Final ATP Yield\nAn overall view of aerobic respiration reveals that a single molecule of glucose can yield up to 32 molecules of ATP. This efficiency is due to the series of reactions that precisely produce energy carriers and ATP at different stages: glycolysis, the link reaction, and the Krebs cycle. However, the exact number of ATP molecules generated can vary, with recent research suggesting that each reduced NAD and FAD contributes to slightly fewer ATP molecules than previously thought.\n\n@@@Impact of Mitochondrial Diseases and Alternative Respiratory Substrates\nMitochondrial diseases, which impair the function of oxidative phosphorylation or the Krebs cycle, can lead to a reduction in ATP production. This may result in an increased reliance on anaerobic respiration and the accumulation of lactate, causing muscle fatigue, weakness, and elevated lactate levels in the bloodstream. Additionally, aerobic respiration can utilize compounds other than glucose, such as products from the breakdown of lipids and proteins.\n\n@@@Practical Applications of Respiration Knowledge\nUnderstanding respiration at the cellular level is not only crucial for academic success but also has practical implications, such as explaining lactate buildup in muscle cells after a sprint or how substances like carbon monoxide can impair ATP production. Exam preparation involves mastering the details of these biochemical processes.\n\n@@@Study Tips and Encouragement\nAs daunting as the study of respiration chemistry may seem, perseverance and repeated review will ensure you grasp the material. Encouragement is extended to keep at it, with the reminder that this knowledge is not only necessary for exams but also serves as a stepping stone to greater achievements.","49":"@@@Proteins: Introduction and Amino Acid Building Blocks\nThere are loads of different proteins with loads of different functions. But what are proteins? What do they look like? Well, for your enjoyment, here are the answers to all those questions and many, many more... Proteins are made from long chains of amino acids. 1) The monomers of proteins are amino acids. 2) A dipeptide is formed when two amino acids join together. 3) A polypeptide is formed when more than two amino acids join together. 4) Proteins are made up of one or more polypeptides. Grant's cries of \"die peptide, die\" could be heard for miles around. He'd never forgiven it for sleeping with his wife. Different amino acids have different variable groups. Amino acids have the same general structure \u2014 a carboxyl group (-COOH), an amine or amino group (-NH2) and an R group (also known as a variable side group).\n\n@@@Amino Acid Diversity and Polypeptide Formation\nStructure of an Amino Acid: R ^\u2014variable group IH, N \u2014 C COOH \\group carboxyl group All living things share a bank of only 20 amino acids.

Amino acids are linked together by condensation reactions to form polypeptides. A molecule of water is released during the reaction. The bonds formed between amino acids are called peptide bonds. The reverse reaction happens during digestion. Amino acid 1 RI - c - IHH - amino acid 2 RI - c - IH condensation COOH CQOH \\ + Na molecule of water is formed during condensation.\n\n@@@Protein Structure: Primary to Quaternary\nProteins Have Four Structural Levels: Proteins are big, complicated molecules. They're much easier to explain if you describe their structure in four 'levels'. These levels are a protein's primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures. Primary Structure \u2014 this is the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain. Secondary Structure \u2014 the polypeptide chain doesn't remain flat and straight. Hydrogen bonds form between the amino acids in the chain. This makes it automatically coil into an alpha (\u03b1) helix or fold into a beta (\u03b2) pleated sheet \u2014 this is the secondary structure. Tertiary Structure \u2014 the coiled or folded chain of amino acids is often coiled and folded further. More bonds form between different parts of the polypeptide chain, including hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds (attractions between negative and positive charges on different parts of the molecule). Disulfide bridges also form whenever two molecules of the amino acid cysteine come close together \u2014 the sulfur atom in one cysteine bonds to the sulfur atom in the other. For proteins made from a single polypeptide chain, the tertiary structure forms their final 3D structure. Quaternary Structure \u2014 some proteins are made of several different polypeptide chains held together by bonds. The quaternary structure is the way these polypeptide chains are assembled together. For proteins made from more than one polypeptide chain (e.g. haemoglobin, insulin, collagen), the quaternary structure is the protein's final 3D structure.\n\n@@@Topic Classification\nTopic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules","50":"@@@Introduction to Nervous Coordination and Neurones\nTopic 6B covers the essential aspects of nervous coordination, focusing on the roles and behaviors of neurones. The section starts with a light-hearted call to action, suggesting that the reader should have their notepad ready to explore the fascinating world of motor neurones and the intricate process of action potentials.\n\n@@@Resting Potential and Membrane Polarization\nNeurone cell membranes exhibit polarization at rest, characterized by a positive charge outside compared to the inside, owing to the difference in the distribution of positive ions. This polarization creates a potential difference or voltage across the membrane known as resting potential, typically around -70 mV. This state is actively maintained by the sodium-potassium pumps and potassium ion channels, making use of active transport and facilitated diffusion, respectively.\n\n@@@Action Potential and Neurone Stimulation\nThe process of action potential begins when a stimulus prompts sodium ion channels to open, allowing sodium ions to flood into a neurone. If the stimulus reaches a certain threshold, it results in a rapid change in potential difference, characterized by depolarization, followed by repolarization, and potentially leading to hyperpolarization. This series of events is integral for the transmission of nerve impulses, where the action potential cannot immediately reoccur due to the refractory period during which ion channels recover.\n\n@@@Wave of Depolarization and Refractory Period\nAn action potential triggers a wave of depolarization that travels along the neurone as sodium ions induce subsequent regions of the neurone to experience the same influx. Meanwhile, the refractory period ensures that action potentials are discrete, imposing limits on impulse frequency and guaranteeing unidirectional travel.\n\n@@@All-or-Nothing Principle of Action Potentials\nThe all-or-nothing nature of action potentials signifies that once the stimulus crosses the threshold, an action potential will launch consistently regardless of stimulus intensity, while sub-threshold stimuli will not generate an action potential. Larger stimuli result in more frequent action potentials rather than stronger ones.\n\n@@@Factors Influencing the Speed of Conduction\nThe text outlines three main factors affecting the speed at which action potentials are conducted: myelination, axon diameter, and temperature. Myelinated neurones feature a myelin sheath, allowing fast saltatory conduction, whereas non-myelinated neurones experience a slower impulse transmission along the axon. Larger axon diameters present less resistance to ion flow, resulting in quicker depolarization. The conduction speed also typically increases with temperature up to a certain point, after which protein denaturation hampers the speed.\n\n@@@Practice and Exam Questions on Nervous Coordination\nToward the end of the section, practice questions are presented to test understanding of the refractory period, the all-or-nothing nature of action potentials, the function of Schwann cells, and factors affecting conduction speed. An exam question follows, which includes a detailed graph displaying the changes in an action potential over time, with sub-questions probing the reader to explain specific changes and calculate the number of action potentials over a given period.\n\n@@@Recap and Encouragement for Understanding Neurones\nIn closing, the text provides encouragement for readers dealing with the complexity of neurone behavior. It emphasizes the importance of electrical charges across neurone membranes initiated by ion pumps and suggests that writing out the information can help solidify the concepts involved in transmitting an action potential. The text focuses on how these electrical charges help to propagate action potentials.","51":"@@@ Overview of Synaptic Transmission and Synapse Structure\n139Synaptic Transmission\u2014When an action potential arrives at the end of a neurone, the information has to be passed on to the next cell, which could be another neurone, a muscle cell, or a gland cell. A synapse is the junction between two cells which facilitates this transmission. This includes:\n- Synapses between neurons, or neurons and effector cells like muscles or gland cells.\n- The synaptic cleft which is the tiny gap between cells at a synapse.\n- The presynaptic neurone with its synaptic knob containing vesicles filled with neurotransmitters.\n- The process of neurotransmitters being released into the cleft when an action potential arrives, which then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.\n- The potential effects on the postsynaptic cell, which could be the generation of a new action potential, muscle contraction, or hormone secretion.\n- Synapses ensure unidirectionality of the impulse and are subject to mechanisms ensuring neurotransmitters are removed from the synaptic cleft to prevent continuous activity.\n- Examples of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine (ACh) and noradrenaline, with cholinergic synapses using acetylcholine.\n- A diagram illustrating the typical structure of a synapse including synaptic knob, vesicles, synaptic cleft, and receptors.\n\n@@@ Cholinergic Synapse Transmission Mechanics\nACh Transmits the Nerve Impulse Across a Cholinergic Synapse\u2014The transmission process detailed from the arrival of an action potential at the synaptic knob of the presynaptic neurone, including:\n- Stimulation of voltage-gated calcium ion channels.\n- Calcium ion influx leading to the movement and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane.\n- Release and diffusion of acetylcholine across the synaptic cleft and binding to cholinergic receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.\n- Sodium ion channels opening in response, potentially causing an action potential if the threshold is met.\n- The breakdown of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase to prevent continuous signaling.\n- A representation of the entire process in the cholinergic synapse, its specific receptors, and enzyme interactions.\n\n@@@ Modulation of Synaptic Response and Neuromuscular Junctions\n140Synaptic Transmission\u2014The next section discusses the nature of neurotransmitters and their varying impacts on synaptic transmission, including:\n- Excitatory neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, which depolarize the postsynaptic membrane and can induce an action potential.\n- Inhibitory neurotransmitters, which hyperpolarize the postsynaptic membrane preventing an action potential.\n- The concept of summation, both spatial and temporal, which allows for a cumulation of signals to potentially reach a threshold for an action potential.\n- The specific case of neuromuscular junctions, which are synapses between motor neurons and muscle cells, how they operate like cholinergic synapses, and their unique features.\n- Both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the context of whether they collectively can or cannot cause an action potential.\n\n@@@ Effects of Drugs on Synaptic Function and Review Questions\n141Synaptic Transmission\u2014Elaborates on how various drugs can influence synaptic transmission through mechanisms like:\n- Agonists, mimicking neurotransmitters, activate more receptors (e.g., nicotine).\n- Antagonists, blocking receptors and preventing activation by neurotransmitters (e.g., curare).\n- Enzyme inhibitors, which prevent neurotransmitter breakdown leading to prolonged receptor activation (e.g., nerve gases).\n- Drugs that stimulate or inhibit neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neurone (e.g., amphetamines, alcohol).\n- Practice and exam questions that test understanding of unidirectionality at synapses, neurotransmitter removal mechanisms, the role of calcium ions, types of neurotransmitters, and the identification of neuromuscular receptor types.\n- A graph depicting potential difference across a postsynaptic membrane and related analysis questions.\n- Further topics on the immune system's impacts on synapses in diseases such as myasthenia gravis, and hypothetical scenarios involving drugs like galantamine that affect synaptic enzymes.\n- Encouragement to review neurotransmitter mechanisms, with an emphasis on understanding through diagrams and labels to aid learning.\n\nTopic 6B \u2014 Nervous Coordination","52":"@@@Introduction to Genetic Inheritance\nTopic 7A \u2014 GeneticsInheritance begins with an attention-grabbing jest about genetic inheritance not being related to who inherits family heirlooms like \"Mum's best china.\" Instead, it's a segue into the topic of genetic inheritance, which refers to the process by which genes and characteristics are passed down from parents to offspring.\n\n@@@Key Genetic Terms and Definitions\nA list of essential genetic terms is provided for a fundamental understanding of genetics. The terms include Gene, Allele, Genotype, Phenotype, Dominant, Recessive, Codominant, Locus, Homozygote, Heterozygote, and Carrier. Each term is diligently defined to give clarity on their individual roles and implications in genetics.\n\n@@@Understanding Genetic Diagrams and Monohybrid Crosses \nThis section discusses how genetic diagrams, also known as Punnett squares, are used to show the potential genotypes of offspring. It elaborates on the process involving diploid organisms, gametes, and the concept of monohybrid inheritance, which is the inheritance of a characteristic controlled by a single gene. The inheritance of wing length in fruit flies is highlighted as an example, showing how dominant and recessive alleles interact across generations.\n\n@@@Punnett Square Illustration and Codominance\nThe Punnett square is further explained, offering a step-by-step guide on determining the F1 and F2 generation outcomes in a genetic cross. It exemplifies inheritance patterns using seed texture and color in pea plants as a case study. Furthermore, codominance is explained through the example of sickle-cell anaemia, showcasing how heterozygotes express both alleles in the phenotype.\n\n@@@Complexities of Multiple Alleles and Blood Type Inheritance\nHere we delve into the complexities arising when a gene has multiple alleles, as opposed to a simple dominant-recessive relationship. The ABO blood group system is cited, explaining how the three alleles for blood type interact, resulting in different blood groups. The section highlights how diverse genotypes can lead to a variety of phenotypes within a population.\n\n@@@Dihybrid Crosses and Phenotypic Ratio Predictions\nThe focus is on dihybrid crosses that simultaneously examine inheritance patterns for two different genes. Genetic diagrams for dihybrid crosses are introduced, illustrating how different combinations of alleles can lead to varying observed phenotypic ratios among offspring, with the pea plant seeds' texture and color used as the model.\n\n@@@Summarizing Different Types of Genetic Crosses and Phenotypic Ratios\nA summary provides a concise overview of typical phenotypic ratios that result from monohybrid, dihybrid, and codominant crosses. This part also acknowledges that real-world genetic outcomes may not always align with theoretical predictions due to factors like sex linkage, autosomal linkage, or epistasis.\n\n@@@Practical Application and Exam Practice\nTying it all together, this section provides practice and exam-style questions to apply the theoretical knowledge of genetics. It reinforces the concepts of genotype, phenotype, and the functions of dihybrid crosses. Theoretical understanding is tested with sample questions on pea plant genetics and the inheritance of coat color in cows, inviting readers to draw genetic diagrams to illustrate their understanding.\n  \n@@@Conclusion and Encouragement for Learning Genetics\nIn a light-hearted closing remark, the reader is encouraged not to despair despite the complexity and volume of terms in genetics. The narrative assures that with a solid understanding of key terms and the workings of genetic diagrams, the subject matter will all \"fall into place.\"","53":"@@@Understanding Sex-Linked Characteristics\nRight, this stuff is fairly hard, so if you don't get it first time don't panic, just work through it again until you do. Some characteristics are sex-linked. The genetic information for gender is carried on two sex chromosomes. In mammals, females have two X chromosomes (XX) and males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). A characteristic is said to be sex-linked when the allele that codes for it is located on a sex chromosome. The Y chromosome is smaller than the X chromosome and carries fewer genes. So most genes on the sex chromosomes are only carried on the X chromosome (called X-linked genes). As males only have one X chromosome, they often only have one allele for sex-linked genes. So, because they only have one copy, they express the characteristic of this allele even if it's recessive. This makes males more likely than females to show recessive phenotypes for genes that are sex-linked. Genetic disorders caused by faulty alleles on sex chromosomes include color blindness and hemophilia. The faulty alleles for both of these disorders are carried on the X chromosome \u2014 they're called X-linked disorders. \n\nExample of Sex-Linked Inheritance\nColour blindness is a sex-linked disorder caused by a faulty allele carried on the X chromosome. As it's sex-linked, both the chromosome and the allele are represented in the genetic diagram, e.g. Xn, where X represents the X chromosome and n the faulty allele for color vision. The Y chromosome doesn't have an allele for color vision so is just represented by Y. Females would need two copies of the recessive allele to be color blind, while males only need one copy. This means color blindness is much rarer in women than men. In the example of genetic diagram, there's a 3 : 1 ratio of offspring without color blindness: offspring with color blindness. But when a female carrier and a male without color-blindness have children (as in this example), only their male offspring are at risk of being color-blind. So you can also say that there's a predicted 2:1:1 ratio \u2014 of female offspring without color-blindness: male offspring without color-blindness: male offspring with color-blindness. This ratio will change if a female carrier (XNXn) and a male with color-blindness (XnY) have children. The predicted ratio will then be 1 : 1 \u2014 of offspring with color-blindness: offspring without color-blindness. The ratio will be the same for offspring of each gender. You only end up with this predicted ratio for a monohybrid F1 cross with a sex-linked characteristic.\n\n@@@Autosomal Genes and Linkage\nAutosome is the fancy name for any chromosome that isn't a sex chromosome. Autosomal genes are the genes located on the autosomes. Genes on the same autosome are said to be linked \u2014 because they're on the same autosome they'll stay together during the independent segregation of chromosomes in meiosis I, and their alleles will be passed on to the offspring together. The only reason this won't happen is if crossing over splits them up first. The closer together two genes are on the autosome, the more closely they are said to be linked. If two genes are autosomally linked, you won't get the phenotypic ratio you expect in the offspring of a cross. For example, in a dihybrid cross between two heterozygous parents you'd expect a 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 ratio in the offspring. Instead, the phenotypic ratio is more likely to be that expected for a monohybrid cross between two heterozygous parents (3:1) because the two autosomally-linked alleles are inherited together. This means that a higher proportion of the offspring will have their parents' (heterozygous) genotype and phenotype. This allows you to use the predicted phenotypic ratio to identify autosomal linkage.\n\n@@@Genetic Cross Results Can Show Autosomal Linkage\nIn the exam, you might get some genetic cross results that show linkage and have to explain them. A scientist was investigating linkage between the genes for eye color and wing length in fruit flies. The gene for normal wings (N) is dominant to the gene for vestigial wings (n), and the gene for red eyes (R) is dominant to the gene for purple eyes (r). The first cross the scientist carried out was between flies homozygous dominant for both normal wings and red eyes (NNRR) and flies homozygous recessive for both vestigial wings and purple eyes (nnrr). The resulting offspring were all heterozygous for normal wings and red eyes (NnRr). The second cross the scientist carried out was between these offspring (NnRr) and the flies homozygous recessive for vestigial wings and purple eyes (nnrr). He expected a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, the results he got for this cross showed an 8:1:1:8 ratio. In order for the NnRr and nnrr genotypes to be so common in the offspring, the NR alleles and the nr alleles in the NnRr parent must have been linked. This means that the NnRr parent produced mostly NR and nr gametes. Some Nr and nR gametes were still made due to crossing over, but there were fewer Nnrr and nnRr offspring overall. As a result, a higher proportion of the offspring have their parents' phenotypes.\n\n@@@Epistatic Gene Interaction\nMany different genes can control the same characteristic \u2014 they interact to form the phenotype. This can be because the allele of one gene masks (blocks) the expression of the alleles of other genes \u2014 this is called epistasis. For instance, in humans, a widow's peak (see picture) is controlled by one gene and baldness by others. If you have the alleles that code for baldness, it doesn't matter whether you have the allele for a widow's peak or not, as you have no hair. The baldness genes are epistatic to the widow's peak gene, as the baldness genes mask the expression of the widow's peak gene. Similarly, flower pigment in a plant is controlled by two genes. Gene 1 codes for a yellow pigment (Y is the dominant yellow allele) and gene 2 codes for an enzyme that turns the yellow pigment orange (R is the dominant orange allele). If you don't have the Y allele, it won't matter if you have the R allele or not as the flower will be colorless. Gene 1 is epistatic to gene 2 as it can mask the expression of gene 2. Crosses involving epistatic genes don't result in the expected phenotypic ratios.\n\n@@@Predicting Phenotypic Ratios involving Epistatic Genes\nJust as you can predict the phenotypic ratios for a normal dihybrid cross, you can predict the phenotypic ratios for dihybrid crosses involving some epistatic genes too. A dihybrid cross involving a recessive epistatic allele results in a phenotypic ratio of 9:3:4, where having two copies of the recessive epistatic allele masks (blocks) the expression of the other gene. For example, crossing a homozygous recessive parent with a homozygous dominant parent will result in this ratio among the F2 generation. A dihybrid cross involving a dominant epistatic allele yields a 12:3:1 ratio. Having at least one copy of the dominant epistatic allele masks the other gene. So, crossing parents with specific homozygous recessive and homozygous dominant genotypes will produce this outcome in the F2 generation. Squash color is an example of this, where a dominant epistatic allele controls the presence of color and another gene controls the actual color expressed. Practice questions at the end can help reinforce the understanding of the concepts, including sex-linked characteristics, autosomal linkage, and epistasis.\n\n@@@Epistasis in Practice Questions and Exam Questions\nQ1 asks about the nature of a sex-linked characteristic. Q2 seeks an explanation of autosomally-linked genes. Q3 inquires about the definition of an epistatic gene. Q4 examines the implications of a dihybrid cross resulting in a 9:3:4 phenotypic ratio in the F1 generation. The exam questions provide further practical applications of these genetic concepts, asking for genetic diagrams and explanations for patterns of inheritance, such as the prevalence of hemophilia in males and the outcome of crosses involving different hair types in a hypothetical organism A. These tests demonstrate how theoretical genetic principles are turned into questions analyzing students' comprehension and application.\n\n@@@Humor in Genetic Understanding\nLastly, a lighthearted comment suggests that biology students expect a 9:1 phenotypic ratio of normal to geek. This quip may serve to lighten the mood after dense information, reflecting a bit of humor sometimes inserted into teaching materials to keep students engaged. As epistasis is acknowledged to be tricky, it reinforces the importance of understanding key principles and being able to navigate through complex genetic concepts.","54":"@@@Overview of DNA and RNA\nThese two pages are all about nucleic acids \u2014 DNA and RNA. These molecules are needed to build proteins, which are required for the cells in living organisms to function. They're right handy little things.\n\n@@@The Function of DNA and RNA\nDNA and RNA Carry Important Information\nDNA and RNA are both types of nucleic acid. They're found in all living cells and they both carry information. 1) DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is used to store genetic information \u2014 that's all the instructions an organism needs to grow and develop from a fertilised egg to a fully grown adult. 2) RNA (ribonucleic acid) is similar in structure to DNA. One of its main functions is to transfer genetic information from the DNA to the ribosomes. Ribosomes are the body's 'protein factories' \u2014 they read the RNA to make polypeptides (proteins) in a process called translation (see p. 85). Ribosomes themselves are made from RNA and proteins.\n\n@@@Nucleotides: The Building Blocks\nDNA and RNA are Polymers of Nucleotides\n1) A nucleotide is a type of biological molecule. It's made from:\n- a pentose sugar (that's a sugar with 5 carbon atoms),\n- a nitrogen-containing organic base, Organic' means that it contains carbon.\n2) Nucleotides are really important. For a start, they're the monomers (see p. 2) that make up DNA and RNA.\n\n@@@Different Sugars in DNA and RNA\nThe Sugar Differences Between DNA and RNA\nThe Sugar in DNA is Called Deoxyribose\n1) The pentose sugar in a DNA nucleotide is called deoxyribose. 2) Each DNA nucleotide has the same sugar and a phosphate group. The base on each nucleotide can vary though. 3) There are four possible bases \u2014 adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C) and guanine (G).\nThe Sugar in RNA is Called Ribose\n1) RNA contains nucleotides with a ribose sugar (not deoxyribose). 2) Like DNA, an RNA nucleotide also has a phosphate group and one of four different bases. 3) In RNA though, uracil (U) replaces thymine as a base.\n\nMary didn't care if it was ribose or deoxyribose, she just wanted her cuppa.\n\n@@@Formation of Polynucleotides\nNucleotides Join Together to Form Polynucleotides\n1) A polynucleotide is a polymer of nucleotides. Both DNA and RNA nucleotides form polynucleotides. 2) The nucleotides join up via a condensation reaction (see p. 2) between the phosphate group of one nucleotide and the sugar of another. 3) This forms a phosphodiester bond (consisting of the phosphate group and two ester bonds). 4) The chain of sugars and phosphates is known as the sugar-phosphate backbone.\n\n@@@Structure of DNA\nDNA's Unique Double-Helix\nDNA is Made of Two Polynucleotide Chains in a Double-Helix Structure\n1) Two DNA polynucleotide strands join together by hydrogen bonding between the bases. 2) Each base can only join with one particular partner \u2014 this is called complementary base pairing (or specific base pairing). 3) Adenine always pairs with thymine (A -T) and cytosine always pairs with guanine (C - G). This means that there are always equal amounts of adenine and thymine in a DNA molecule and equal amounts of cytosine and guanine. 4) Two hydrogen bonds form between A and T, and three hydrogen bonds form between C and G. 5) Two antiparallel (running in opposite directions) polynucleotide strands twist to form the DNA double-helix.\n\n@@@RNA's Structure and Role\nRNA is a Relatively Short Polynucleotide Chain\nRNA is made from a single polynucleotide chain (not a double one). It's much shorter than most DNA polynucleotides.\n\n@@@Understanding the Genetic Code Carriers\nDNA and genetic information\n6) DNA was first observed in the 1800s, but lots of scientists at the time doubted that it could carry the genetic code because it has a relatively simple chemical composition. Some argued that genetic information must be carried by proteins \u2014 which are much more chemically varied. 7) By 1953, experiments had shown that DNA was the carrier of the genetic code. This was also the year in which the double-helix structure, which helps DNA to carry out its function, was determined by Watson and Crick.\n\n@@@Practice Questions and Study Tips\nPractice Questions\nQ1 Name the bases in RNA\nExam Questions\nQ2 The bar chart shows the percentage of the bases in a DNA sample that are adenine and cytosine. On the chart, sketch bars to show the percentages of thymine and guanine in the sample.

[3 marks] [3 marks]\n\nGive me a D. give me an A\/, give me an A! What do you get? \u2014 confused...\nYou need to learn the structure of DNA \u2014 the polynucleotide strands, the hydrogen bonds, and don't forget complementary base pairing. Make sure you know the differences between RNA and DNA too \u2014 interesting stuff.","55":"@@@Introduction to Stem Cells\nStem cells \u2014 they're the daddy of all cells, the big cheese, the top dog, and the head honcho. Here's why... Multicellular organisms are made up from many different cell types that are specialized for their function, such as liver cells, muscle cells, white blood cells. All these specialized cell types originally came from stem cells. Stem cells are unspecialized cells that can develop into other types of cell. They divide to become new cells, which then become specialized. All multicellular organisms have some form of stem cell. Stem cells are found in the embryo (where they become all the specialized cells needed to form a fetus) and in some adult tissues (where they become specialized cells that need to be replaced, for instance, stem cells in the intestines constantly replace intestinal epithelial cells). Totipotent stem cells are able to mature into any type of body cell in an organism, including the cells that make up the placenta in mammals. Totipotent stem cells are only present in mammals in the first few cell divisions of an embryo. Later, embryonic stem cells become pluripotent; they can still specialize into any cell in the body but lose the ability to become the cells that make up the placenta. Adult mammals have either multipotent or unipotent stem cells. Multipotent stem cells can differentiate into a few different types of cells, while unipotent stem cells can only differentiate into one type of cell.\n\n@@@Mechanisms of Cell Specialization in Stem Cells\nStem cells become specialized due to the selective expression of their genes during development. All stem cells contain the same genes, but not all genes are transcribed and translated (expressed). Transcription is when DNA is copied into mRNA, and translation is when proteins are produced using the code in mRNA. Under the right conditions, some genes are expressed and others are turned off. mRNA is only transcribed from specific genes, which is then translated into proteins that alter the cell. These proteins determine cell structure and control cellular processes, leading to a specialized cell. An example given is the production of red blood cells from bone marrow stem cells, which involves expressing the genes needed for hemoglobin production and for removing the nucleus.\n\n@@@Cardiomyocytes Derived from Unipotent Stem Cells\nCardiomyocytes, the heart muscle cells, are thought to be unable to replicate themselves in mature mammals, leading to the belief that heart cells can't regenerate, causing issues when the heart is damaged. Nevertheless, some scientists believe that cardiomyocytes can be replaced by new ones derived from a limited supply of unipotent stem cells in the heart. Research varies on how quickly this regeneration process occurs, with some suggesting it could be a slow process, while others believe it happens more frequently.\n\n@@@Therapeutic Applications of Stem Cells\nStem cells hold potential to treat a variety of human disorders due to their ability to differentiate into a range of specialized cell types. Existing therapies using stem cells include treatments for diseases affecting the blood and immune system, such as bone marrow transplants for leukemia and lymphoma, as well as genetic disorders like sickle-cell anemia and SCID. Research is ongoing for the use of stem cells in treating spinal cord injuries, heart disease, bladder conditions, respiratory diseases, and even growing organs for transplant.\n\n@@@Advances in Stem Cell Types and Sources\nWith the need for stem cells in the medical field, scientists extract them from various sources. Adult stem cells, although limited in differentiation capabilities, can be obtained from adult tissue through simple operations. Embryonic stem cells, derived from early-stage embryos, offer a more versatile range of cell specialization but raise ethical concerns due to the destruction of embryos. To mitigate ethical issues, scientists have developed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) by reprogramming specialized adult body cells to pluripotency, a method that may prove useful in research and medicine.\n\n@@@Ethical Considerations in the Use of Embryonic Stem Cells\nThe procurement of embryonic stem cells through IVF involves the destruction of embryos, prompting ethical debates. Some believe that embryos have the right to life from the moment of fertilization, making it wrong to destroy them, while others have fewer qualms if the embryos are unfertilized and unviable in the long term. The production of adult stem cells, which does not involve embryo destruction, is a preferable alternative for some, although it limits the range of cell types that can be formed. Induced pluripotent stem cells represent a promising development without the ethical issues associated with embryonic stem cells, as they are reprogrammed from adult tissue.\n\n@@@Conclusion: The Potential of Stem Cells in Medicine\nStem cells could significantly impact the medical field by saving lives, improving the quality of life, and offering treatment options for various conditions. Societal decision-makers must balance the pros and cons, scientific advancements, and ethical considerations when implementing stem cell research and therapies. It is crucial for individuals to understand these factors for an informed perspective on the use of stem cells in medical treatments.\n\nNote: The text for the practice questions and exam question prompts has not been included in the subsections as it is related to test preparation rather than informational content on the topic of stem cells.","56":"@@@Overview of Recombinant DNA Technology and Its Practical Applications\nUsing recombinant DNA technology, scientists can manipulate genetic material in order to modify microorganisms, plants, and animals; this practice is known as genetic engineering or genetic modification (GM). Through this technology, microorganisms can be transformed to produce useful proteins, such as insulin, via in vivo cloning. Similar techniques are applied to plants and animals, enabling the expression of desirable proteins by introducing foreign genes into plasmids used as vectors. The correct promoter regions are necessary to ensure the expression of these proteins in the transformed species. In animals, such genetic modification can occur at the embryonic stage for uniform gene expression across all body cells or can be targeted to specific cell types to ease harvesting or to avoid potential damage to the organism from inappropriate protein production.\n\n@@@The Benefits of Recombinant DNA for Humanity\nRecombinant DNA technology holds significant promise for various applications that directly benefit humans. In agriculture, modified crops can lead to higher yields, enhanced nutritional value, and resistance to pests, reducing the likelihood of famine and malnutrition, as well as minimizing the ecological impact of pesticides. An example of this is Golden Rice, which has been developed to combat vitamin A deficiency. Industry benefits as well, with enzymes for processes such as cheese-making now being produced from transformed organisms more efficiently and ethically. Medicine has seen advances due to recombinant DNA technology with faster, more affordable manufacture of drugs and vaccines, represented by the production of synthetic human insulin that is more effective than insulin derived from animals.\n\n@@@Ethical, Financial, and Social Issues Surrounding Recombinant DNA\nDespite the numerous benefits of recombinant DNA technology, there are also significant ethical, financial, and social concerns. Agricultural practices like the monoculture of transformed crops raise apprehensions about increased susceptibility to diseases and loss of biodiversity. The threat of herbal resistance due to gene transfer from transformed crops to wild plant species, and the potential contamination of organic crops with GM seeds poses problems for organic farmers and biodiversity. In industry, the domination of a few large biotechnology companies stirs anti-globalization sentiments, as they can outcompete smaller businesses, stifle consumer choice, and introduce economic challenges in markets like the EU that reject GM foods. Medical issues include the potential limitation on life-saving technologies by patent-holding companies and the misuse of genetic engineering, such as in the controversial idea of designer babies. Furthermore, there are debates around the ownership of genetic material and the implications of seed patents held by corporations on farmers and the legal system.\n\n@@@Potential Humanitarian Impact of Recombinant DNA Technology\nContrasting with the above concerns, many see recombinant DNA technology as a path to humanitarian advances. These include the development of crops resistant to environmental stresses like drought, using transformed crops as bioreactors to produce pharmaceuticals, and the cheaper production of medicines. Additionally, gene therapy, a direct application of recombinant DNA technology to human health, holds promise for treating or curing genetic disorders and cancer, provided ethical dilemmas can be addressed and managed effectively.\n\n@@@Gene Therapy as a Recombinant DNA Application\nGene therapy represents a cutting-edge use of recombinant DNA technology to treat genetic disorders and cancer by altering mutated genes. The specific strategies used in gene therapy are contingent on the type of genetic disorder present. Gene therapy can be classified into two types: somatic therapy, which aims to correct genetic anomalies in body cells and does not affect offspring, and germ line therapy, which alters reproductive cells to prevent the passing down of a disease\u2014but is currently illegal in humans. Various methods, including vectors like viruses, plasmids, or liposomes, are employed to insert beneficial alleles into cells. There are high hopes for gene therapy in the medical community, albeit the technology remains in its early stages and involves numerous ethical considerations.\n\n@@@Case Study and Exam Preparation for Recombinant DNA Topics\nQuestions are presented to students in order to test their understanding of transformed organisms, financial issues of recombinant DNA technology in industry, and gene therapy. An additional case study provides a scenario for applying recombinant DNA technology to enhance drought resistance in wheat, asking students to explain the transformation process, its potential benefits, and the possible objections from anti-globalization activists. Examination preparation also involves pondering the societal implications of recombinant DNA technology, fostering a comprehensive understanding of the topic's various facets for academic success.","57":"@@@Processing and Presenting Data: The Essentials of Data Interpretation\nProcessing data means taking raw data and doing some calculations with it, to make it more useful. Processing the Data Helps You to Interpret it. You Need to be Able to Calculate Percentage Change and Ratios. Calculating percentage change helps to quantify how much something has changed, e.g. the percentage change in the growth rate of pea plants when a fertiliser is added. To calculate it, you use this equation: \nPercentage change = (final value - original value) \/ original value x 100\nA positive value shows an increase, and a negative value shows a decrease. For example, a person's blood glucose concentration before a meal was 4.2 mmol dm-3. Two hours after the meal, it was 6.5 mmol dm-3. Calculate the percentage change. \nPercentage change = (6.5 - 4.2) \/ 4.2 x 100 = 55% (2 s.f.) So the person's blood glucose concentration was 55% higher after the meal. Ratios can also be used to compare different types of quantities, such as comparing an organism's surface area to volume ratio. Ratios are most useful in their simplest form, achieved by dividing each side by the same number until no further simplification is possible.\n\n@@@Using Logarithms to Plot Graphs and the Importance of Averages\nIt's tricky to plot graphs with very small and very large numbers (e.g. both 0.1 and 1000) on the same axis. We can make it easier by converting values to their logarithms and plotting them on a logarithmic scale, such as a log10 scale. On a log10 scale, each value is ten times larger than the value before. This means the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 on a log10 scale correspond to 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000 on a linear scale. To calculate logarithms, one typically uses the log button on a calculator, commonly representing log10, but it's essential to know how your calculator works. When experiments are repeated, it's standard to calculate the mean (average) by adding together all data values and dividing by the number of values in the sample. Additionally, it's often necessary to calculate the range, showing data spread, by subtracting the smallest data value from the largest. However, standard deviation can be more valuable than range, as it indicates how values cluster around the mean, showing precision. Besides the mean, the median and mode are also types of averages. The median is the middle value when data are in numerical order, or the average of the middle two values if the data count is even, while the mode is the value appearing most often, though data may have no mode or multiple modes.\n\n@@@Considerations When Rounding Numbers and Using Standard Form\nWhen processing data, you may round long numbers to a certain number of significant figures. The rule of thumb is to round numbers up if the next digit is five or higher and down otherwise, but the final answer's accuracy should match the least accurate measurement used in the calculation. Additionally, very large or small numbers with many zeros can be expressed in standard form by moving the decimal point left or right, with a positive or negative power of ten representing the number of decimal places moved.\n\n@@@The Relevance of Statistical Tests in Data Analysis\nUnderstanding statistical tests is critical to analyzing data. The Student's t-test is useful for comparing two sets of data means to determine if the difference between them is statistically significant. The Chi-squared test suits categorical data, comparing observed versus expected results, while the correlation coefficient measures the degree of data correlation. Familiarity with statistical symbols such as < (less than), > (more than), \u00ab (much less than), and \u00bb (much more than) is also important.\n\n@@@Graph Selection and Interpretation Skills\nChoosing a suitable graph type is a fundamental step for presenting data. Bar charts or pie charts are appropriate for qualitative or discrete data, while histograms or line graphs serve continuous data. With scatter graphs, relationships between two variables can be visualized. When constructing graphs, ensure the dependent variable is on the y-axis, label axes with quantity and units, and use a scale that allows the graph to cover at least half of the graph paper. Calculate rates from graphs by finding the gradient of a straight or tangent line for linear or curved data representations, respectively. Understanding how to convert units and consider significant figures are also crucial skills for accurate data interpretation.","58":"@@@Introduction to Proteins and Their Amino Acid Building Blocks\n\nProteins are diverse biomolecules essential for various functions within living organisms. They are complex structures composed of long chains of amino acids. As the monomers of proteins, amino acids can combine in various ways: two amino acids join to form a dipeptide, whereas a polypeptide is constituted by the linkage of more than two amino acids. Proteins themselves are then made up of one or more polypeptides. An example provided is Grant's outcry against dipeptides due to a personal grudge, adding a touch of humor to the explanation. To better understand amino acids, they are characterized by having a general structure consisting of a carboxyl group (-COOH), an amine group (-NH2), and a variable R group which distinguishes the 20 types of amino acids shared among all living organisms. Amino acids are linked by condensation reactions to form polypeptides, with peptide bonds being established between amino acids, and water molecules being released in the process. Additionally, the reverse reaction of peptide bond breaking occurs during digestion, known as hydrolysis.\n\n@@@Understanding Protein Structure: The Four Levels\n\nThe intricate nature of proteins can be elucidated through their structural hierarchy spanning four levels. The primary structure refers to the unique sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain. In the secondary structure, hydrogen bond interactions cause the polypeptide chain to automatically coil into an alpha (\u03b1) helix or fold into a beta (\u03b2) pleated sheet. The tertiary structure involves further coiling and folding, with additional bonds, such as hydrogen and ionic bonds, contributing to the protein's three-dimensional conformation. Disulfide bridges, specifically between cysteine amino acids, further stabilize this structure. For proteins comprised of a single polypeptide chain, the tertiary structure represents their final 3D structure. However, proteins with multiple polypeptide chains exhibit a quaternary structure, which defines how these individual chains assemble to form the functional protein, as in the cases of hemoglobin and insulin. The text concludes with an analogy comparing protein structure to a Slinky toy, which can help picture the complex coiling and interaction that proteins undergo.\n\n@@@Diverse Functions of Proteins in Living Organisms\n\nProteins fulfill numerous roles owing to their varied structures and shapes tailored for specific functions. Enzymes, typically spherical due to tight polypeptide folding, are soluble and play significant roles in metabolism, such as breaking down or synthesizing large molecules. Antibodies, crucial components of the immune response, consist of two light polypeptide chains and two heavy chains, featuring a variable region with diverse amino acid sequences. Transport proteins, including channel proteins integral to cell membranes, are made up of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids that cause the proteins to fold, forming channels for molecule and ion transport. Structural proteins, notably strong due to long polypeptide chains and cross-links, include keratin and collagen, present in hair, nails, and connective tissue, respectively.\n\n@@@Identification of Proteins: The Biuret Test\n\nDetecting the presence of proteins in a sample, such as a food sample, can be achieved via the biuret test, which involves two stages. To create an alkaline test environment, a few drops of sodium hydroxide solution are introduced, followed by the addition of copper(II) sulfate solution. A positive result, indicated by a color change to purple, confirms protein presence, whereas the solution remaining blue signifies a negative result. Due to the subtle coloration, careful observation is required during the test. This process is significant in biochemical analyses, where the confirmation of proteins is crucial.\n\n@@@Practice and Exam Questions to Assess Understanding\n\nIn reinforcing the reader's comprehension of the presented material, practice questions prompt them to recall common groups in amino acid molecules, enumerate three functions of proteins, and describe the procedure for testing protein presence in a sample. Exam questions further challenge the understanding by asking for a description of dipeptide formation with a specific example of leucyl-alanine and an explanation of the tertiary structure in a single-polypeptide protein like myoglobin. This section serves as a direct application of the knowledge gained, providing an opportunity for self-assessment and a more tangible grasp of protein structure concepts.","59":"@@@Enzyme Action: Essential Biological Catalysts\nEnzymes crop up loads in biology \u2014 they're really useful because they make reactions work quickly. So, whether you feel the need for some speed or not, read on \u2014 because you really need to know this basic stuff about enzymes. Enzymes speed up chemical reactions by acting as biological catalysts. A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being used up in the reaction itself. Enzymes catalyse metabolic reactions \u2014 both at a cellular level (e.g. respiration) and for the organism as a whole (e.g. digestion in mammals). Enzymes can affect structures in an organism (e.g. enzymes are involved in the production of collagen, an important protein in the connective tissues of animals) as well as functions (like respiration). Enzyme action can be intracellular \u2014 within cells, or extracellular \u2014 outside cells. Enzymes are proteins (see previous page). Enzymes have an active site, which has a specific shape. The active site is the part of the enzyme where the substrate molecules (the substance that the enzyme interacts with) bind to. Enzymes are highly specific due to their tertiary structure (see next page).\n\n@@@Enzymes Lower the Activation Energy of a Reaction\nIn a chemical reaction, a certain amount of energy needs to be supplied to the chemicals before the reaction will start. This is called the activation energy \u2014 it's often provided as heat. Enzymes lower the amount of activation energy that's needed, often making reactions happen at a lower temperature than they could without an enzyme. This speeds up the rate of reaction. When a substrate fits into the enzyme's active site it forms an enzyme-substrate complex \u2014 it's this that lowers the activation energy. Here are two reasons why:\n1) If two substrate molecules need to be joined, being attached to the enzyme holds them close together, reducing any repulsion between the molecules so they can bond more easily.\n2) If the enzyme is catalysing a breakdown reaction, fitting into the active site puts a strain on bonds in the substrate, so the substrate molecule breaks up more easily. The diagram illustrates the energy profile of a chemical reaction both with and without an enzyme, demonstrating how the activation energy is reduced in the presence of an enzyme.\n\n@@@The \u2018Lock and Key\u2019 Model and its Evolution to 'Induced Fit'\nEnzymes are a bit picky \u2014 they only work with substrates that fit their active site. Early scientists studying the action of enzymes came up with the 'lock and key' model. This is where the substrate fits into the enzyme in the same way that a key fits into a lock, and the enzyme is unchanged after the reaction. Scientists soon realized that the lock and key model didn't give the full story. The enzyme and substrate do have to fit together in the first place, but new evidence showed that the enzyme-substrate complex changed shape slightly to complete the fit. This locks the substrate even more tightly to the enzyme. Scientists modified the old lock and key model and came up with the 'induced fit' model.\n\n@@@Topic 1A \u2014 Biological Molecules\nThis section likely relates to a broader discussion on biological molecules, but no further context is given in the text provided.","60":"@@@Enzyme Action and their Role as Biological Catalysts\nEnzymes crop up loads in biology \u2014 they're really useful 'cos they make reactions work quickly.

This is where the substrate fits into the enzyme in the same way that a key fits into a lock. However, new evidence showed that the enzyme-substrate complex changes shape slightly to complete the fit, which brought about a new model known as the 'induced fit' model. This model explains that the substrate doesn't only have to be the right shape to fit the active site, it also makes the active site change shape in the right way as well. The 'induced fit' model is still widely accepted \u2014 for now, anyway.\n\n@@@Enzyme Properties and Their Relationship to Tertiary Structure\nEnzymes are very specific \u2014 they usually only catalyze one reaction, for example, maltase only breaks down maltose, sucrase only breaks down sucrose. This specificity is because only one complementary substrate will fit into the active site. The active site's shape is determined by the enzyme's tertiary structure (which is determined by the enzyme's primary structure). Each different enzyme has a different tertiary structure and so a different shaped active site. If the tertiary structure of the enzyme is altered in any way, the shape of the active site will change. This means that the substrate won't fit into the active site, an enzyme-substrate complex won't be formed, and the enzyme will no longer be able to carry out its function. The tertiary structure of an enzyme may be altered by changes in pH or temperature. The primary structure (amino acid sequence) of a protein is determined by a gene. If a mutation occurs in that gene, it could change the tertiary structure of the enzyme produced.\n\n@@@Conceptual Analogy and Practice Questions\nFurthermore, to better understand the importance of enzymes in reducing activation energy, one can liken it to an assault course where enzymes provide the necessary boost to overcome a significant obstacle, like helping someone over a tall wall. To solidify your understanding of enzymes and their functionality, here are a few practice and exam questions. Practice Questions: Q1 What is an enzyme?

Q2 Explain how a change in the amino acid sequence of an enzyme may prevent it from functioning properly.","61":"@@@Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity\nNow you know what enzymes are and how they work, let's take a look at what makes them tick. Humans need things like money and the newest mobile phone, but enzymes are quite content with the right temperature and pH.\n\n@@@Temperature's Influence on Enzyme Activity\nTemperature has a Big Influence on Enzyme Activity. Like any chemical reaction, the rate of an enzyme-controlled reaction increases when the temperature's increased. More heat means more kinetic energy, so molecules move faster. This makes the enzymes more likely to collide with the substrate molecules. The energy of these collisions also increases, which means each collision is more likely to result in a reaction. But, if the temperature gets too high, the reaction stops. 1) The rise in temperature makes the enzyme's molecules vibrate more. 2) If the temperature goes above a certain level, this vibration breaks some of the bonds that hold the enzyme in shape. 3) The active site changes shape and the enzyme and substrate no longer fit together. 4) At this point, the enzyme is denatured\u2014it no longer functions as a catalyst. Optimum temperature \u2013 every enzyme has an optimum temperature; for most human enzymes, it's around 37\u00b0C but some enzymes, like those used in biological washing powders, can work well at 60 \u00b0C.\n\n@@@pH's Effect on Enzyme Activity\npH Also Affects Enzyme Activity. All enzymes have an optimum pH value. Most human enzymes work best at pH 7 (neutral), but there are exceptions. Pepsin, for example, works best at acidic pH 2, which is useful because it's found in the stomach. Above and below the optimum pH, the H+ and OH- ions found in acids and alkalis can mess up the ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds that hold the enzyme's tertiary structure in place. This makes the active site change shape, so the enzyme is denatured.\n\n@@@Impact of Enzyme Concentration on Reaction Rate\nEnzyme Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction. 1) The more enzyme molecules there are in a solution, the more likely a substrate molecule is to collide with one and form an enzyme-substrate complex. So increasing the concentration of the enzyme increases the rate of reaction. 2) But, if the amount of substrate is limited, there comes a point when there's more than enough enzyme molecules to deal with all the available substrate, so adding more enzyme has no further effect.\n\n@@@Influence of Substrate Concentration on Reaction Rate\nSubstrate Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction Up to a Point. 1) The higher the substrate concentration, the faster the reaction\u2014more substrate molecules mean a collision between substrate and enzyme is more likely and so more active sites will be used. This is only true up until a 'saturation' point though. After that, there are so many substrate molecules that the enzymes have about as much as they can cope with (all the active sites are full), and adding more makes no difference. 2) Substrate concentration decreases with time during a reaction (unless more substrate is added to the reaction mixture), so if no other variables are changed, the rate of reaction will decrease over time too. This makes the initial rate of reaction (the reaction rate at the start) the highest rate of reaction.\n\n@@@Concluding Remarks on Biological Molecules - Topic 1A\nThis discussion provides an overview of how various factors such as temperature, pH, enzyme concentration, and substrate concentration influence enzyme activity. Understanding these factors is crucial for manipulating and predicting the behavior of enzymes in biological systems, as outlined in Topic 1A \u2013 Biological Molecules.","62":"@@@SPECIFICATION REFERENCE: THE CHEMISTRY OF LIFE 1A\nBiology is the study of living things \u2013 which consist of chemicals, like the dragonfly, the plant it rests on (fig A), the cow in fig C, and the salt it licks. Understanding basic principles of chemistry aids in grasping biological systems, as the bonds within and between molecules influence their properties and functions. For instance, understanding water's chemistry requires knowledge of chemical bonds and molecule dipoles.\n\nBasic units of elements are atoms, and compounds form when different elements' atoms react. Atom structure includes a nucleus with protons and neutrons, and surrounding electrons in shells. Chemical stability results from a full outer electron shell, achieved through ionic or covalent bonding. In ionic bonding, atoms give or receive electrons, becoming ions held together by ionic bonds (fig B). Covalent bonding involves sharing electrons, yielding usually neutral, strong molecules; some have dipoles due to uneven electron sharing (fig D).\n\n@@@IONIC AND COVALENT BONDING\nIonic bonding describes the process where atoms involved in a reaction either give or receive electrons, forming anions (negative ions) and cations (positive ions), which are held together by strong ionic bonds, as exemplified by the formation of sodium chloride (fig B). Covalent bonding, in contrast, involves the sharing of electrons between atoms resulting in strong and often neutral molecules, although some can be polar if electrons aren't shared equally, leading to slight charge separations known as dipoles (fig D). These dipoles are common when hydrogen atoms are involved in the bond.\n\n@@@THE IMPORTANCE OF INORGANIC IONS\nCells, comprising 60-70% water, often carry ionic substances that dissociate into ions in solution. These ions perform specific roles within cells and organisms. Nitrate ions contribute to plants' DNA, amino acids, and protein synthesis. Phosphate ions are necessary for ATP, ADP, DNA, and RNA. Chloride ions help in nerve impulses and secretory systems, while hydrogen carbonate ions regulate blood pH. Sodium ions aid in nerve impulses, calcium ions in plants' and animals' structure and muscle function, hydrogen ions in cellular processes and pH balance, and magnesium ions in chlorophyll production. Understanding the differences between ionic substances, charged particles, and polar molecules is crucial for biology students (fig C).\n\n@@@THE CHEMISTRY OF WATER\nAll cellular reactions occur in water, making it vital for bodily substance transportation and as a reaction participant in photosynthesis; it's necessary for all life forms (fig E). Water, a H2O molecule, is polar because of its asymmetric electron distribution, contributing to water's unique properties, such as high melting and boiling points fostered by the many hydrogen bonds between its molecules (fig G).\n\n@@@THE IMPORTANCE OF WATER\nWater's properties make it indispensable in biological systems. Its polarity allows it to dissolve various substances, being a universal solvent and excellent transport medium. Water's unusual density behavior allows ice to float, acting as an insulator. It has a high heat capacity, essential for habitat stability. Water is incompressible, cohesive, and adhesive, playing roles in transport systems and demonstrating high surface tension. These attributes of water, derived from its dipoles and hydrogen bonding, influence various biological functions (fig H). Biology students should understand the connections between water's properties, dipoles, and hydrogen bonding, exploring both positive and negative impacts on organisms.\n\n@@@EXAM HINTS, CHECKPOINT, AND SUBJECT VOCABULARY\nTo excel in biology exams, grasp the concepts of dipoles, differences between ionic and polar substances, formation of hydrogen bonds, and water's impact on life. Discussing issues in exam answers means exploring all aspects and providing balanced assessments. Biology vocabulary to remember includes anion, cation, ionic bonds, covalent bonds, dipole, polar molecule, dissociation, and hydrogen bonds, which are fundamental for problem-solving skills.\n\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

The dipole nature of water plays a crucial role in this context. Learning Objectives include understanding the importance of water, its dipole nature, and its role in biological transport systems.\n\n@@@IONIC AND COVALENT BONDING\nBiology is inherently connected to chemistry since all living things, such as dragonflies, plants, and cows, are composed of chemicals. For instance, the chemical salt, as seen in fig C, is essential for the survival of a cow. A fundamental understanding of chemistry and its principles, particularly chemical bonds and the creation of dipoles in molecules, contributes to a deeper comprehension of biological systems. Atoms are the basic unit of elements and can form compounds by reacting with each other. Atoms consist of a nucleus with protons and neutrons, which is surrounded by electrons in shell orbitals. Chemical reactions involving these atoms aim to achieve a stable outer electron shell through processes like ionic bonding, where electrons are transferred leading to ion formation and the resulting ionic bonds, as shown in fig B with the formation of sodium chloride. On the other hand, covalent bonding involves the sharing of electrons. Some covalent compounds are polarized, with slightly negative and positive parts due to uneven sharing of electrons. Polar molecules such as the water molecule (fig D) exhibit this dipole characteristic, which is common in bonds involving hydrogen atoms.\n\n@@@THE IMPORTANCE OF INORGANIC IONS\nThe dissolution of ionic substances in water leads to dissociation, allowing the ions to separate. Since cells in living organisms are composed of a significant amount of water, ionic substances generally exist as ions within these cells, fulfilling various specialized roles. Inorganic ions have specific functions in both individual cells and organisms. For example, nitrate ions are important for DNA and protein synthesis in plants, phosphate ions are needed for ATP, ADP, DNA, RNA, and chloride ions play a role in nerve impulses and other systems, while hydrogen carbonate ions buffer blood pH. Concerning cations, sodium ions are significant in nerve function, calcium ions are essential for plant cell structure and animal bone formation, hydrogen ions are involved in metabolism and pH balance, and magnesium ions are vital for chlorophyll production in plants. Understanding and differentiating between ionic substances, charged particles, and polar molecules is vital for exam preparedness. Animals, such as cows illustrated in fig C, obtain necessary salts for bodily functions through mineral licks.\n\nThe provided text reminds the reader that it is an uncorrected proof subject to publisher's discretion and not intended for resale, circulation, or distribution. \u00a9Pearson 2018","64":"@@@INTRODUCTION TO MAMMALIAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF BLOOD CLOTTING\nYou have a limited volume of blood. In theory, a minor cut could endanger life as the torn blood vessels allow blood to escape. First, your blood volume will reduce and if you lose too much blood, you will die. Second, pathogens can get into your body through an open wound. In normal circumstances, your body protects you through the clotting mechanism of the blood. This mechanism seals damaged blood vessels to minimise blood loss and prevent pathogens getting in.\n\n@@@INITIAL PHASES OF FORMING A CLOT\nPlasma, blood cells, and platelets flow from a cut vessel. Contact between the platelets and components of the tissue (e.g., collagen fibers in the skin) causes the platelets to break open in large numbers. They release several substances, two of which are particularly important. Serotonin causes the smooth muscle of the blood vessel to contract. This narrows the blood vessels, cutting off the blood flow to the damaged area. Thromboplastin is an enzyme that starts a sequence of chemical changes that clot the blood (see fig H). The cascade of events that results in a life-saving or life-threatening clot. When you cut yourself, this is the process which seals the blood vessels and protects the delicate new tissues that form underneath.\n\n@@@DETAILS OF THE BLOOD CLOTTING PROCESS\nThe blood clotting process is a very complex sequence of events in which there are many different clotting factors. Vitamin K is important in the production of many of the compounds needed for the blood to clot, including prothrombin. Here is a simple version of the events in the blood clotting process.\n\nThromboplastin catalyses the conversion of a large soluble protein called prothrombin found in the plasma into another soluble protein, the enzyme called thrombin. Prothrombin is biologically inactive while thrombin is biologically active \u2013 prothrombin is a precursor of thrombin. This conversion happens on a large scale at the site of a wound. Calcium ions need to be present in the blood at the right concentration for this reaction to happen.\n\nThrombin acts on another soluble plasma protein called fibrinogen, converting it to an insoluble substance called fibrin. Again, fibrinogen is the biologically inactive precursor of biologically active fibrin. The fibrin forms a mesh of fibers to cover the wound.\n\n@@@LEARNING TIP FOR BLOOD CLOTTING PROCESS\nRemember that \u2018pro\u2019 means before.

These pages cover the facts behind the replication mechanism, as well as some of the history behind its discovery. This stuff is really clever. Honest.\n\n@@@The Semi-Conservative Nature of DNA Replication\nDNA replicates by semi-conservative replication. DNA copies itself before cell division (see p. 32) so that each new cell has the full amount of DNA. The method is called semi-conservative replication because half of the strands in each new DNA molecule are from the original DNA molecule. This means that there's genetic continuity between generations of cells (i.e., the cells produced by cell division inherit their genes from their parent cells). The process involves several steps:\n1) The enzyme DNA helicase breaks the hydrogen bonds between bases on the two polynucleotide DNA strands, making the helix unwind to form two single strands.\n2) Each original single strand acts as a template for a new strand. Complementary base pairing means that free-floating DNA nucleotides are attracted to their complementary exposed bases on each original template strand \u2014 A with T and C with G.\n3) Condensation reactions join the nucleotides of the new strands together \u2014 catalyzed by the enzyme DNA polymerase. Hydrogen bonds form between the bases on the original and new strands.\n4) Each new DNA molecule contains one strand from the original DNA molecule and one new strand.\n\n@@@Directionality in DNA Replication: DNA Polymerase Function\nDNA polymerase moves in opposite ways along the antiparallel DNA strands. Each end of a DNA strand is slightly different in its structure. One end is called the 3' (three prime) end and the other is called the 5' (five prime) end. In a DNA helix, the strands run in opposite directions \u2014 they're antiparallel. The active site of DNA polymerase is only complementary to the 3' end of the newly forming DNA strand, meaning the enzyme can only add nucleotides to the new strand at the 3' end. As a consequence, the new strand is made in a 5' to 3' direction and the DNA polymerase moves down the template strand in a 3' to 5' direction. Because the strands are antiparallel, the two DNA polymerases working on each strand move in opposite directions.\n\n@@@Historical Experiment: Evidence for Semi-Conservative Replication\nMeselson and Stahl provided crucial evidence for semi-conservative replication. Initially, Watson and Crick, who determined the structure of DNA, proposed the theory of semi-conservative replication. This was later confirmed by Meselson and Stahl's experiment. Before their work, it was uncertain whether DNA replication was semi-conservative or conservative. They used isotopes of nitrogen to track the replication process:\n1) Two samples of bacteria were grown in nutrient broths, one containing light nitrogen (14N) and the other containing heavy nitrogen (15N).\n2) DNA samples from each batch were centrifuged, with heavy nitrogen DNA settling lower because of its weight.\n3) Bacteria from the heavy nitrogen batch were transferred to a broth with only light nitrogen and allowed to replicate.\n4) If replication was conservative, heavy (original) DNA would settle at the bottom, new light DNA at the top.\n5) If replication was semi-conservative, new bacterial DNA molecules would contain strands of both old heavy DNA and new light DNA, hence settling in the middle.\n6) The DNA settled in the middle, indicating a mixture of heavy and light nitrogen, thus confirming semi-conservative replication in bacteria. After this discovery, other scientists demonstrated that this method is universal for DNA replication in living organisms.\n\n@@@Recap and Study Prompts: Exam Preparation\nMake sure you can recall the mechanism of DNA replication \u2014 you might be asked for it in your exam. You might also be asked to evaluate the work of the scientists who validated Watson and Crick's theory of semi-conservative replication.\nPractice Questions:\nQ1: What is the role of DNA helicase in DNA replication?\nQ2: What's the key difference between the conservative and semi-conservative theories of DNA replication?\nExam Question:\nQ1: Describe the process of semi-conservative DNA replication.

Learning objectives include understanding how the structures of blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries) relate to their functions.\n\n@@@OVERVIEW OF BLOOD VESSELS AND THEIR FUNCTION\nThe blood vessels that make up the circulatory system can be thought of as the biological equivalent of a road transport system. The arteries and veins are like large roads carrying heavy traffic while the narrow town streets and tracks are represented by the vast area of branching and spreading capillaries called the capillary network. In the capillary network, substances carried by the blood are exchanged with cells in the same way that products are transported from factories, oil refineries, or farms and distributed into shops and homes. The structures of the different types of blood vessels closely reflect their functions in your body.\n\n@@@ARTERIES AND THEIR STRUCTURE\nArteries carry blood away from your heart towards the cells of your body. Almost all arteries carry oxygenated blood, with the pulmonary artery and the umbilical artery during pregnancy as exceptions. The arteries leaving the heart branch off in every direction, and the diameter of the lumen gets smaller the further away it is from the heart, ending with the arterioles. The middle layers of the artery wall contain elastic fibers and smooth muscle; arteries nearest to the heart have more elastic fibers, while those further from the heart have a greater proportion of muscle tissue. Blood is pumped out from the heart in a regular rhythm, about 70 times a minute, with each heartbeat sending a high-pressure flow of blood into the arteries. The major arteries close to the heart must withstand these pressure surges and contain a lot of elastic fibers so that they can stretch and accommodate the greater volume of blood without being damaged. Between surges, the elastic fibers return to their original length, squeezing the blood to move it along in a continuous flow. The pulse felt in an artery is the effect of the surge each time the heart beats. The blood pressure in all arteries is relatively high, but it falls in arteries further away from the heart, known as the peripheral arteries. In the peripheral arteries, the muscle fibers in the vessel walls contract or relax to change the size of the lumen, controlling the blood flow. This regulates the activity of organs and will be discussed more in Book 2, Topic 7.\n\n@@@CAPILLARIES AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE IN EXCHANGE\nArterioles lead into networks of capillaries which are very small vessels that spread throughout the tissues of the body. The capillary network links the arterioles and the venules, ensuring no cell is far from a capillary, making the diffusion between cells and blood quick. Capillaries have a very simple structure, with walls that consist of just one very thin cell, which allows rapid diffusion of substances between the blood and the cells. Oxygen and other molecules quickly diffuse out of the blood in the capillaries into nearby body cells, and carbon dioxide and waste molecules diffuse into the capillaries. The blood is oxygenated when entering the capillary network and carries less oxygen when it leaves, now with more carbon dioxide.\n\n@@@VEINS AND THEIR ROLE IN RETURNS TO THE HEART\nVeins carry blood back towards the heart, and most carry deoxygenated blood, with the pulmonary vein and the umbilical vein during pregnancy as exceptions. Tiny venules lead from the capillary network and combine into larger vessels leading back to the heart. Only two veins, the inferior vena cava and the superior vena cava, carry blood from the body tissues back to the heart. Veins can hold a large volume of blood, acting as a blood reservoir, and the low pressure in veins is due to the elimination of pressure surges before the blood reaches the capillary system. Blood returns to the heart by means of muscle pressure and one-way valves. The contraction of large muscles, particularly in the arms and legs, during physical activity squeezes the veins with the help of one-way semilunar valves, pushing blood towards the heart and preventing any backflow. This ensures that blood flows in one direction only. The characteristics of the main types of blood vessels \u2013 arteries, veins, and capillaries \u2013 are different and affect how the blood flows through the body and the role of the vessels within the body.","67":"@@@THE MAMMALIAN HEART: SPECIFICATIONS AND LEARNING OBJECTIVES\nThe section outlines the specifications referenced as 1.8 and 4 related to the study of the mammalian heart, focusing on the relation of its structure and operation to its function, and an understanding of the cardiac cycle. It emphasizes the heart's role within animal transport systems, particularly in mammals, where it is a four-chambered muscular organ, protected within the chest by ribs and sternum. Over an average lifetime, it beats roughly 3 billion times, pumping over 200 million liters of blood.\n\n@@@THE STRUCTURE OF THE HEART AND ITS COMPONENTS\nThe mammalian heart is described as two joint pumps that work in synchronicity, with the right side receiving blood from the body to send to the lungs, and the left side doing the opposite. This process ensures that oxygenated and deoxygenated blood do not mix within the heart, thanks to a thick muscular septum and cardiac muscle that can contract regularly without fatigue. The muscle has an ample blood supply provided by the coronary arteries, and it contains myoglobin, a respiratory pigment with a high affinity for oxygen, to meet the metabolic demands of consistent contractions.\n\n@@@ACTION OF THE HEART AND ITS FUNCTIONAL CYCLE\nThis section provides a deep dive into the heart's operational cycle, detailing how blood flows through the heart and the different pressures involved in the opening and closing of valves. It describes the function of heart chambers and valves like the tricuspid and bicuspid valves, the pressure changes that drive their operation, and the role of tendinous cords. The muscular distinction between the left and right sides of the heart is highlighted, explaining the varying pressure needs based on the proximity of the lungs and extremities of the body. The concept of systole and diastole as parts of the cardiac cycle is explained, noting this as a continuous process of contraction and relaxation.\n\n@@@INTERESTING FACTS AND THE HEART'S INTERNAL COMPLEXITY\nTwo \"Did You Know?\" segments add interesting facts about the heart's development and its anatomy. A description of the septum and the mention of the foramen ovale provide insight into the heart's function in an embryo and the potential condition known as patent foramen ovale. It also points out that while diagrams of the mammalian heart look simple, an actual dissection reveals much more complexity, which aids in understanding how the heart functions as a three-dimensional pump.\n\n@@@VOCABULARY AND LEARNING RESOURCES\nThe section concludes with a checkpoint intended to test comprehension through descriptions and discussions related to the path of blood, the relationship between structure and function in the heart, and key elements thereof. A comprehensive list of subject vocabulary defines important terms associated with the heart, its function, and the cardiac cycle, providing a learning resource for further study and understanding of this crucial organ.","68":"@@@OVERVIEW OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES\n1BSPECIFICATION REFERENCE5. Learning objectives include understanding the course of events that lead to atherosclerosis. Cardiovascular diseases have serious global consequences, with almost 18 million people dying each year, according to World Health Organization data from 2017. Cardiovascular diseases accounted for 31% of all global deaths, making it the leading cause of death and disability. Notably, a third of these deaths occurred in individuals younger than 70, which underlines the severity of cardiovascular diseases and their link to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis, the hardening of the arteries, is a condition that can start in late childhood, involving the buildup of fatty plaques inside arteries, which can restrict or block blood flow. This process is particularly likely to affect the coronary and carotid arteries, with fig B summarizing the typical development of a plaque that starts with slight damage to the endothelium, followed by an inflammatory response, cholesterol build-up, atheroma formation, and then the accumulation of fibrous tissue and calcium salts. This sequence results in hardened plaques that narrow the arteries and increase rigidity. Learning tips highlight the initial damage to the endothelium often being caused by high blood pressure from smoking, and exam hints encourage memorization of the stages of atherosclerosis development.

This condition predominantly occurs in arteries due to the high pressure of blood flow, leading to damage in the endothelium and small areas of damage. In contrast, veins have lower pressure and are less likely to sustain such damage. Cardiovascular diseases were responsible for 31% of deaths, at times due to communicable diseases, childbirth, nutritional conditions, injuries, or other causes. Exam hints stress understanding the terms around atherosclerosis and consequential disorders like aneurysms, angina, and myocardial infarctions. \n\n@@@CONSEQUENCES OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS ON HEALTH\nAtherosclerosis can have severe effects on health, including the formation of aneurysms, raised blood pressure, heart diseases, and strokes. An aneurysm results from the narrowing of an artery by a plaque, causing the artery to bulge and weaken with the potential for catastrophic internal bleeding. Raised blood pressure due to narrow arteries can damage essential organs such as the kidneys, eyes, and brain, possibly leading to kidney damage, blindness, or types of strokes. Heart diseases linked to atherosclerosis include angina and myocardial infarction (heart attack), with angina showing symptoms during exercise due to reduced oxygen supply, and myocardial infarction occurring when an artery is completely blocked by a clot. Diagnostic imaging using dyes, clot-busting drugs, and surgical interventions like stents and bypass surgery are discussed as treatment options. Strokes, another consequence of atherosclerosis, can lead to permanent disabilities or death, depending on the location and severity of the arterial blockage in the brain. Rapid treatment is essential for the survival and recovery process of heart attack and stroke victims. Checkpoint questions ask readers to explain the worsening nature of endothelium plaques and their dangerous implications, describe the role of atherosclerosis in cardiovascular diseases, and compare heart attacks and strokes.

It further details the impact of cardiovascular diseases, which represent a significant cause of global mortality according to World Health Organization data from 2017. The burden of cardiovascular diseases accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide, affecting a considerable number of individuals under the age of 70. Atherosclerosis is highlighted as a key contributor to many cardiovascular conditions.\n\n@@@The Pathophysiology of Atherosclerosis\nAtherosclerosis is characterized by the development of plaques within the arterial walls, starting in late childhood and progressing throughout an individual's life. These plaques can restrict or block blood flow, commonly forming in the coronary and carotid arteries. The text provides a detailed description of plaque development, from endothelial damage to inflammatory response, accumulation of cholesterol, fatty deposits, fibrous tissue, calcium salts, and eventual plaque formation that narrows arteries and stiffens their walls. The learning material encourages readers to remember that endothelial damage, often caused by factors such as high blood pressure and smoking, is the initial stage in atherosclerosis development. Furthermore, the reader is prompted to learn the stages of atherosclerosis for examination purposes.\n\n@@@Mechanisms and Consequences of Plaque Formation\nThe formation of plaques within the arteries is explored in greater detail, emphasizing the role of inflammation, white blood cells, cholesterol accumulation, and the hardening of plaques. These processes contribute to the narrowing and decreased elasticity of arterial walls, compounded by rising blood pressure and possible formation of additional plaques. The text explains the cyclical nature of atherosclerosis' exacerbation and the various factors involved in its development, setting the stage for an in-depth examination in a subsequent chapter.\n\n@@@Health Implications of Atherosclerosis\nSerious health repercussions associated with atherosclerosis are unveiled. The condition can precipitate aneurysms due to arterial narrowing and ensuing blood collection, where increased pressure can lead to a weakened wall and potential rupture, causing life-threatening internal bleeding. Atherosclerosis also contributes to raised blood pressure, which inflicts damage on organs such as the kidneys, eyes, and brain. Kidney damage, retinal cell death leading to blindness, and strokes caused by cerebral bleeding are highlighted as some of the significant risks.\n\n@@@Heart Diseases Resulting from Atherosclerosis\nThe text emphasizes angina and myocardial infarction as the two most common forms of heart disease associated with atherosclerosis. Angina is described as occurring due to gradual plaque accumulation in coronary arteries, which diminishes blood flow and induces pain, particularly during exercise. Treatment options for angina include lifestyle changes, medication to dilate blood vessels, and other drugs to manage heart rate. The consequences of further coronary blockage and the critical nature of understanding these medical terms for exam preparation are underscored. The section concludes with a reminder that atherosclerosis may lead to further complications such as aneurysms, angina, and myocardial infarctions, reinforcing the importance of clarity regarding these terms.","70":"@@@SPECIFICATION REFERENCE: RISK, CORRELATION AND CAUSE\nREFERENCE1 RISK, CORRELATION AND CAUSE1.17 1.15 LEARNING OBJECTIVES: \n- Understand why people\u2019s perception of risks is often different from the actual risks, including underestimating and overestimating the risks due to diet and other lifestyle factors in the development of heart disease.\n- Be able to distinguish between correlation and causation. \nEvery country has diseases which affect its people and may even kill them. Some of these diseases affect you randomly \u2013 there is nothing you can do to change whether you are affected or not. However, for many diseases, especially non-communicable (non-infectious) conditions such as heart disease and cancer, you can increase or lower your risk of becoming ill, based on factors in your lifestyle. If you understand the risk factors, you can help to make yourself and your family healthier.\n\n@@@UNDERSTANDING RISK AND PROBABILITY\nWHAT IS RISK? \nThe word risk is used regularly in everyday conversation, but in science, it has a very specific meaning. In science, risk describes the probability that an event will happen. Probability means the chance or likelihood of the event, calculated mathematically. For example, imagine you have six coloured balls \u2013 red, blue, green, yellow, orange, and purple \u2013 in a black cloth bag (see fig A). If you reach in and pull out a single ball, the probability (risk) of getting, say, a green ball can be expressed in one of three ways:\n- 1 in 6\n- 0.166 recurring (0.17)\n- 17%.\nThis is the case for any one of the six colours in the bag. In the same way, it is possible to work out your risk of developing certain specified diseases or of dying from a specified cause.\n\n@@@PERCEPTION VS. MATHEMATICAL RISK\nHOW DO WE PERCEIVE RISK? \nThe actual risk of doing something is not always the same as the sense of risk one feels. Most people don\u2019t think twice before getting into their car \u2013 but globally you have an annual risk of 1 in 5747 of being killed in a road traffic accident. On the other hand, many people get very worried before flying, but commercial flights have a 1 in 4.5\u20135.5 million risk of crashing. Personal perception of risk is based on a variety of factors which include:\n- How familiar you are with the activity \n- How much you enjoy the activity \n- Whether or not you approve of the activity.\nThe actual mathematical risk may play very little part in developing your personal perception of risk. People often overestimate the benefits, or minimize the risk, of behavior that they want to continue. Conversely, they will over-emphasize the risks of activities they want to avoid or prevent others from doing them. While there is strong evidence that obesity is linked to diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers, people still become overweight due to their liking for eating. Similarly, the knowledge of the mathematical risk of an early death if you smoke cigarettes doesn\u2019t always stop people from smoking.\n\n@@@CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH AND RISK: THE ROLE OF EPIDEMIOLOGY\nEPIDEMIOLOGY: \nIf you know the number of people in a population who are affected by a disease, it is possible to calculate the average risk of developing that disease for a person within that population. However, the risk is higher for some than others, based on lifestyle and inherited genes. Identifying risk factors that may contribute to the cause of a disease is possible by comparing the risks of people with common factors (e.g., smoking) against the average risk for the whole population. In the case of diseases influenced by many factors, such as atherosclerosis, the condition is called multifactorial. The study of disease patterns and causes is known as epidemiology. It's important to note that correlation, when two datasets change together, does not equate to causation; further research is needed to establish a causal link.\n\n@@@ANALYZING DATA AND EXAM HINTS\nEXAM HINT: When provided with data in the form of a graph, make sure to read the axis titles carefully to understand what the data represents. Also, do not base conclusions on a single set of data. For instance, UAE data suggests obesity is linked to diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, consistent with global findings. Dr. Raghib Ali's ongoing Healthy Future Study in Abu Dhabi aims to confirm these patterns and find ways to reduce disease risks. When analyzing stats, such as the UAE obesity and diabetes figures in relation to cardiovascular disease deaths, it is essential to gather more data to substantiate any causal relationships.\n\n@@@PERSONAL AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN CONTEXT OF RISK\nCHECKPOINT: \nQuestions are posed to reinforce understanding, such as explaining the difference between risk, correlation, and causation, and the implications of smoking on heart disease risk, suggesting reasons for the prevalence of obesity despite the known risks, and instructing to create a bar chart based on given statistics to compare with the UAE data.\n\n@@@SUBJECT VOCABULARY DEFINITIONS\nSUBJECT VOCABULARY: \nDefinitions of key terms are provided to clarify scientific concepts discussed in the text, such as non-communicable conditions, risk, probability, risk factors, multifactorial disease, epidemiology, correlation, and causation. This section serves the reader as a glossary for better understanding the topics covered throughout the text.\n\nPlease note that the text above includes a statement that the content is an uncorrected proof, subject to change, and not for resale, circulation, or distribution, as indicated by the copyright statement from Pearson 2018.","71":"@@@SPECIFICATION REFERENCE AND LEARNING OBJECTIVES\nSPECIFICATION REFERENCE1C2 INVESTIGATING THE CAUSES OF CVDs1.16 1.12\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n\u25fc Be able to evaluate the design of studies used to determine health risk factors, including sample selection and \nsample size used to collect data that are both valid and reliable.\n\u25fc Know how factors such as genetics, age and gender increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).\nEverywhere you look, on television, in newspapers and on the \ninternet, there are reports of factors which affect your health. Eat fruit and vegetables, drink orange juice, take lots of exercise, enjoy these foods \u2013 how do we know which advice is based on good science, and which is given to us because someone wants to sell us something? There are many ways in which you can evaluate the design of studies to decide if the data are meaningful.\n\n@@@DESIGNING STUDIES TO INVESTIGATE HEALTH RISKS\nDESIGNING STUDIES\nMost epidemiological studies are based on a very big sample size \u2013 usually, the bigger the study, the more meaningful the results. The ideal is to investigate one factor or variable, keeping all other variables the same (controlled). However, controlling variables is almost impossible when you are working with human beings. The way people live is complex and varies a lot, so it is hard to detect how any one factor affects people. When a larger number of people are studied, it is more likely that patterns may emerge, even with all the other differences between the people involved. Evidence based on large amounts of data is more likely to be statistically significant than evidence based on small studies.\n\n@@@SIGNIFICANCE OF LONGITUDINAL STUDIES AND META-ANALYSIS\nSome epidemiological studies are carried out over a long time. These longitudinal studies are very valuable because they follow the same group of individuals over many years (see fig A). This means the impact of their known lifestyle on their health can be tracked over time. For example, the M\u00fcnster Heart Study looked at cardiovascular disease in 10,856 men aged 36\u201365 in Europe, following them from the start of the study well into the 21st century. The results from this study are still seen as important because so many people were involved over a long period of time. The Framingham Study in the US also provided much data \u2013 but was limited because they were all from similar American citizens. The study started in 1948 and it is still going on \u2013 the scientists have widened the population they gather data from, so it is more relevant now. An ambitious new study called the National Children\u2019s Study has been set up in the US to follow 100,000 children from birth until they are 21 years old. From 2008\u20132012, children were selected to be representative of the whole of the US population. One major objective of the study is to examine how environmental inputs and genetic factors interact to affect the health and development of children. This is believed to be the biggest longitudinal study ever set up. Similarly, the UAE Healthy Future Study will be longitudinal, looking at the same group of volunteers over a number of years.\n\nSometimes, scientists look at all the available studies in a subject area and analyse the available data in a massive literature study. This combines small and large studies and can give more reliable evidence than any one of the studies alone. This is called a metadata analysis (meta-analysis).\n\n@@@EVALUATING SCIENTIFIC STUDIES FOR VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY\nEVALUATING SCIENTIFIC STUDIES\nWhen considering a study, you need to examine the methodology to see if it is valid. That means that it is properly designed to answer the question or questions being asked. You also need to see if the measurements have been carried out with precision. It is important to find out if other scientists have been able to repeat the methodology and have had similar results \u2013 if so, the results are considered more reliable.\nIt is also important to know who carried out the research, who funded it and where it was published. Then to decide whether or not any of these factors might have affected or biased the study. You need to evaluate the data and conclusions from the study in the light of all these factors.\n\n@@@EXAM HINT AND REVIEW OF RISK FACTORS\nEXAM HINT\nRemember the meaning of the following terms.\nValid: answers the question the scientists are asking\nPrecise: measurements with little difference between them\nReliable: the investigation is repeatable by other scientists who get \nsimilar results\nThey are important in evaluating all practical work and research.\n\nIn the next few pages, you are going to look at some of the evidence that scientists have collected suggesting factors that may \u2013 or may not \u2013 affect your risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In each case, you need to look carefully at the type of evidence that is presented and think about what else you need to know to make firm conclusions.\n\n@@@NON-MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS FOR CVDs AND HOW STUDIES INFORM UNDERSTANDING\nRISK FACTORS FOR CVDs\nThe results from many epidemiological studies have identified a range of risk factors linked to CVDs. These factors divide into two main groups \u2013 those you can\u2019t change and those you can do something about (see Section 1C.3).\nNON-MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS FOR ATHEROSCLEROSIS\nThere are three main risk factors for CVDs which cannot (at the present time) be changed.\n \u2022 Genes: studies show that there is a genetic tendency (trend) in some families, and also in some ethnic groups, to develop CVDs. These trends can include\u2013\narteries which are easily damaged\n\u2013 a tendency to develop hypertension which can cause arterial damage and make CVDs more likely\n\u2013 problems with the cholesterol balance of the body.\n \u2022 Age: as you get older, your blood vessels begin to lose their elasticity and to narrow slightly. This can make you more likely to suffer from CVDs, particularly heart disease.\n \u2022 Gender: statistically, under the age of 50, men are more likely to suffer from heart disease (and other CVDs) than women. The female hormone oestrogen, which is an important factor in the woman\u2019s menstrual cycle, appears to reduce the build-up of plaque. This gives women some protection against CVDs until they go through the menopause when oestrogen levels fall.\n\n@@@EVIDENCE FROM GENETIC STUDIES IN SWEDEN\nLOOKING AT THE DATA\nIdentical twin studies are an excellent resource when investigating whether there is a genetic factor at work, because identical twins have exactly the same genes. Any differences should therefore be due to the environment in which they live. A major twin study was conducted in Sweden and was based on over 21,000 pairs of twins, both identical and non-identical. This study showed that (for male twins) if one twin died of heart disease between the ages of 36 and 55, then the risk of the other twin also dying of heart disease was eight times higher than if neither was affected (see fig A). However, as the twins got older, one dying of heart disease had less of a correlation with the other twin also dying of heart disease. In other words, there appears to be a clear genetic link to heart disease in younger men, but it gets less in much older men.\n\n@@@SUBJECT VOCABULARY AND CONCEPTS\nSUBJECT VOCABULARY\nlongitudinal studies scientific studies which follow the same group of individuals for many years\nmetadata analysis (meta-analysis) when data from all the available studies in a particular area are analysed\nvalid an investigation which is well designed to answer the question being asked\nprecision measurements with only slight variation between them\nreliable evidence which can be repeated by several different scientists\nbiased when someone is unfairly for or against an idea (e.g. when a scientist is paid by someone with a vested interest in a specific result \u2013 they may receive benefit from the outcome)\nevaluate to assess or judge the quality of a study and the significance of the results"}}
