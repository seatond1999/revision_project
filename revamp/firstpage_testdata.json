It is commonly \nacknowledged that it is easier to learn and remember things if you have \nactually done them rather than having read about them or been told about \nthem. That is why this book is illustrated throughout by experiments, usually \nwith a set of data for you to work through and questions to answer. \nNothing is like the \u2018real thing\u2019, however, so you should be carrying out many \nof these experiments for yourself in the laboratory. In particular you will need \nto pay careful attention to the experiments designated as Core Practicals  in the \nEdexcel specifi  cation. These will form the basis of questions on practical \nwork in the two AS papers and in Paper 3 of the A level examination. \nYou may be asked to describe these experiments in the examination and\/\nor answer questions based on them. All eight AS Core Practicals  are fully \ndescribed in this Year 1 Student's Book, with a set of typical results and the \nsort of questions you may be asked in the examination.\nMany other experiments are also described in detail. Some are included to \nillustrate and give you a better understanding of the theory, while some are \nparticularly designed to help you develop your practical skills\nThe Edexcel specifi  cation identifi  es particular key practical skills that should \nbe developed through teaching and learning and that will form the basis of \npractical assessment:\n\u25cf independent thinking\n\u25cf use and application of scientifi  c methods and practices\n\u25cf numeracy and the application of mathematical concepts in a practical \ncontext\n\u25cf instruments and equipment.\nFull details of the requirements for practical work, including a comprehensive \nappendix on Uncertainties and practical work , can be found in the specifi  cation \nposted on the Edexcel website: www.edexcel.com.\nBefore we look at these aspects of practical work, however, we need to \nbe clear about certain terminology used in physics, particularly precision, \naccuracy and errors.\nIn the following sections, the bulleted lists in orange  indicate in more detail \nthe skills that will be assessed in the examinations. 2 Practical skills\n807527_C02_Edexcel_Physics_010-024.indd   10 24\/02\/2015   14:06","2":"25 3.1 Speed, velocity and acceleration\n 3 Rectilinear motion\nPrior knowledge\nIn this chapter you will need to be able to:\n\/uni279C substitute numerical values into formulae and equations using appropriate units. \n\/uni279C plot and draw graphs to show how distance and speed change with time \n\/uni279C determine the gradient of linear graphs.\nThe key facts that will be useful are:\n\/uni279C Velocity, acceleration and displacement are vector quantities.\n\/uni279C average velocity = displacement\ntime\n\/uni279C acceleration = change in velocity\ntime\n\/uni279C A body in free fall on Earth accelerates downwards at 9.81 m s\u22122.\nTest yourself on prior knowledge\n1 What is meant by a vector quantity?\n2 Calculate the displacement of an object that travels with an average \nvelocity of 4.5 m s\u22121 for 8.0 s.\n3 The velocity of a car changes from 36 km h\u22121 to 18 km h\u22121 in 8.0 s. \nCalculate the acceleration of the car in m s\u22122.\n4 Calculate the velocity of a brick 2.2 s after it is accidentally dropped \nfrom the top of a building.\n5 Sketch a displacement\u2013time graph for a body moving at constant \nvelocity.\n3.1 Speed, velocity and acceleration\nRectilinear motion means motion along a straight path.

The \nGreek word for amber is elektron , which is the origin of our words \u2018electron\u2019 \nand \u2018electricity\u2019.\nIn this section you will learn that all matter contains electric charges and \nthat if these charges are made to move, an electric current is created. The \ndiff  erence between metallic conductors, semiconductors and insulators is \nthen discussed in terms of the mobility of charges.\nIn simple terms, we can think of all matter as consisting of atoms. These may be \nconsidered to be made up of protons and neutrons, which form a nucleus that is \nsurrounded by a \u2018cloud\u2019 of electrons. Protons and electrons have the property \nof charge , which gives rise to electrical forces. Historically, the charge on \nprotons was called positive  and that on electrons was designated negative .\nUnder normal circumstances we do not observe any eff  ects due to these \ncharges, because most of the time objects have equal numbers of protons and \nelectrons so that the charges cancel out. Indeed, the idea of the conservation \nof charge  (that is, equal quantities of positive and negative charge) is a \nfundamental concept in physics \u2013 rather like the conservation of energy. \nOnly when charges move in some way does their eff  ect become apparent.\nFigure 7.1 confi  rms that there are two types of charge and that like charges \nrepel while unlike charges attract .

We will now look at how we can make charges move. We will \nsee that a cell produces an electromotive force, which creates a potential \ndiff  erence (or \u2018voltage\u2019) in a circuit. The charges in the circuit components \nand connecting wires experience a force, causing the charges to move round \nthe circuit.

The Edexcel \nspecifi  cation has been developed from the best of the Edexcel concept-led \nand the Salters Horners context-led approaches. Although the book has been \nwritten specifi  cally to cover the concept approach to the specifi  cation, it also \nmakes a most valuable resource for the context approach as it is illustrated \nthroughout by contextual examples and practice questions. The authors both \nhave vast experience of teaching, examining and writing about physics. Both \nhave examined for Edexcel at a senior level for over 30 years.\nAs the title suggests, this book is designed primarily as a resource for the fi  rst \nyear of the A-level course. It does, however, encompass all the material you \nneed if you are only pursuing your studies of physics to AS level.\nA key aspect of the text is the emphasis on practical work. Although you \ndo not have a practical examination as such, questions on practical work \npervade both AS papers. If you are doing A level, you will also have a third \npaper comprising practical-based and synoptic questions. There is also an \ninternally assessed Practical Endorsement  at A level, for which you need to start \na portfolio of work in Year 1. All the Core Practicals  in the specifi  cation are \ndescribed here in detail and in such a way that students can carry out the \nexperiments in a laboratory environment. Each experiment has a set of data \nfor the reader to work through, followed by questions similar to those you \nwill be asked in the examination.

The Edexcel \nspecifi  cation has been developed from the best of the Edexcel concept-led \nand the Salters Horners context-led approaches. Although the book has been \nwritten specifi  cally to cover the concept approach to the specifi  cation, it also \nmakes a most valuable resource for the context approach as it is illustrated \nthroughout by contextual examples and practice questions. The authors both \nhave vast experience of teaching, examining and writing about physics. Both \nhave examined for Edexcel at a senior level for over 30 years.\nAs the title suggests, this book is designed primarily as a resource for the fi  rst \nyear of the A-level course. It does, however, encompass all the material you \nneed if you are only pursuing your studies of physics to AS level.\nA key aspect of the text is the emphasis on practical work. Although you \ndo not have a practical examination as such, questions on practical work \npervade both AS papers. If you are doing A level, you will also have a third \npaper comprising practical-based and synoptic questions. There is also an \ninternally assessed Practical Endorsement  at A level, for which you need to start \na portfolio of work in Year 1. All the Core Practicals  in the specifi  cation are \ndescribed here in detail and in such a way that students can carry out the \nexperiments in a laboratory environment. Each experiment has a set of data \nfor the reader to work through, followed by questions similar to those you \nwill be asked in the examination.

Liquids are generally \nconsidered to be incompressible, but \ngases are readily squeezed (try putting \nyour finger over the outlet of a bicycle \npump and pushing in the handle). \nBecause of this, the pressure needs to \nbe stated in addition to the temperature \nwhen the density of a gas is quoted. \nDensity is given the symbol \u03c1 (\u2018rho\u2019).\nTable 12.1 gives some examples of the \ndensities of fluids. The values are at \n293 K and gas pressure of 1.01 \u00d7 105 Pa.Key term\nDensity  is given by the following \nexpression:\ndensity = mass\nvolume\n\u03c1 = m\nv\nActivity 12.1\nFinding the density of air\nA flask and its attachments are placed onto a balance (sensitivity \u00b10.01  g or less) and the \ntotal mass is recorded. A vacuum pump is used to remove as much air as possible from the \nflask (Figure 12.1). The flask should be encased with a stiff wire mesh as a precaution against \nimplosion and safety goggles must be worn. A protective screen between the flask and observers \nis also recommended. The flask and attachments are reweighed so that the mass of the gas \nremoved from the flask can be found.\nTo measure the volume of gas (at its \ninitial pressure), the end of the rubber \ntube is immersed in a beaker of water \nand the clip is released. Water is forced \ninto the tube by the external air pressure,  \nand the volume of the water in the flask \nequals the volume of the evacuated air.\nThe following results were obtained:\n\u25cf mass of flask plus attachments plus \nair = 421.38  g\n\u25cf mass of flask plus attachments after \nair removed = 420.80 g\n\u25cf volume of water used to replace the \nair removed = 450 ml.\nQuestion\n1 Use these readings to determine the \ndensity of air.\nscrew clip\nto\nvacuum\npump borosilicate \nglass flaskrubber tube\nbeaker\nwaterwater r eplacing\nevacuated air\nFigure 12.1 Finding the volume of air removed from a flask.Fluid Density\/kg  m\u20133\nmercury 13 600\nwater 1000\nethanol 790\ncarbon dioxide 1.78\nair 1.24\nhelium 0.161\nhydrogen 0.081Table 12.1 Densities of some fluids.\n807527_C12_Edexcel_Physics_176-190.indd   177 27\/01\/15   1:30 pmPrior knowledge\nThis is a short list of topics that \nyou should be familiar with before \nstarting a chapter.

The diameter, d, of the lead is measured with a micrometer, or \ndigital calipers, at four places along its length, at different orientations, \nto give a good average. The lead is then taped to a half-metre rule, with \nabout 1  cm protruding beyond the zero end of the rule, and the circuit in \nFigure 10.7 is set up.\nFirm contact is made at different lengths, l, along the lead. The current, \nI, and potential difference, V, are recorded, and the corresponding \nresistance, R, is calculated for each value of l. A graph of R against l is \nthen plotted \u2013 it is sensible to plot l in metres at this stage (Figure 10.8).\nR = \u03c1l\nA \nwhere A = \u03c0d2\n4 and R\nl is the gradient of the graph.\nQuestions\nA typical set of results is shown in Table 10.1.\nTable 10.1\nd\/mm 2.24 2.23 2.25 2.24\n1 Why is a micrometer, or digital calipers, a suitable choice of \ninstrument for measuring the diameter of the pencil lead?\n2 What check should you make before using this instrument?\n3 Explain why it is a good technique to measure the diameter \nof the pencil lead at four places along its length, at different \norientations.\n4 Using the data in Table 10.1, plot a graph of resistance R \nagainst length l and hence find a value for the resistivity of \ngraphite.

The fact that the graph does not go through the \norigin shows that there is also a significant systematic error caused by contact \nresistance  due to poor contact between the crocodile clip and the pencil lead. \nA graphical method minimises the random error by averaging out the values and \nvirtually eliminates the systematic error when the gradient is taken.l\/mm V\/V I\/A R\/\u2126\n  20 1.48 0.925\n  40 1.51 0.786\n  60 1.53 0.648\n  80 1.55 0.587\n100 1.58 0.527\n120 1.60 0.465\n807527_C10_Edexcel_Physics_130-147.indd   136 23\/01\/15   9:34 am\n 6 Work, energy and power 86Power and motion\nIf, for example, a canoeist paddles at speed \nv for distance \u0394x against a uniform retarding force F, she will be working at a constant rate:\n\u0394W = F \u00d7 \u0394x\nPower = \u2206W\n\u2206t = F \u00d7\u2009\u2206x\n\u2206t = F \u00d7 \u2206x\n\u2206t = F \u00d7 vPower (W) = retarding force (N) \u00d7 speed (m \ns\u20131)P = Fv\nExample\nA motorised wheelchair is driven at 2.5 \nm s\u20131 against an average resistive force of 80 N.

He did \nthis as a marketing ploy to give some idea of the power of his steam engines \ncompared with the power that could be obtained from a horse. Thus a 5\n hp engine would supposedly generate the same power as five horses. Until about \n50 years ago, cars in Britain were taxed according to a calculated horsepower. \nFor example, the iconic Morris Minor 1000 was rated at 10\n hp (although it actually developed 48\n hp). In today\u2019s terms, 1\n hp = 746 watts, so the Morris Minor developed a power of 48 \u00d7 746 \nW = 36 kW.Test yourself\n7 By taking measurements from the Sankey diagram \nin Figure 6.8, make an estimate of the efficiency of \nthe power station.\n8 a) Calculate the efficiency of a pulley system if \nthe operator pulls on the rope with a force of \n40 N over a distance of 2.0 \nm in order to raise a 100 kg mass by a height of 6 \ncm. b) Give a reason why such a system is not 100% \nefficient.9 Calculate the average power generated by a cyclist \ntravelling at a constant speed of 12 \nm s\u20131 against an average resistive force of 15 \nN. 10 Calculate the average power generated by a horse \npulling a plough if the horizontal, resistive forces \nare 1200 N and the horse ploughs a furrow of length 186 m in 5 minutes.\n807527_C06_Edexcel_Physics_074-090.indd   86\n22\/01\/15   3:51 pm\n137 10.4 Effect of temperature on the resistivity of a metalTest yourself \n3 The material in the table below is taken from a data book:\nMaterial Gauge \nno.Diameter\/\nmmArea\/mm2Ohms per \nmetreResistivity\/  \n\u2126\tm\ncopper 26 0.4572 0.1642 a) 1.72 \u00d7 10\u20138\nconstantan 30 b) 0.0779  6.29 c)\nnichrome 34 0.2337 d) 25.2 e)\n Calculate the missing data a)\u2013e).\n4 The \u2018lead\u2019 in a pencil is made of graphite, with clay added to make it  \nharder.

It is commonly \nacknowledged that it is easier to learn and remember things if you have \nactually done them rather than having read about them or been told about \nthem. That is why this book is illustrated throughout by experiments, usually \nwith a set of data for you to work through and questions to answer. \nNothing is like the \u2018real thing\u2019, however, so you should be carrying out many \nof these experiments for yourself in the laboratory. In particular you will need \nto pay careful attention to the experiments designated as Core Practicals  in the \nEdexcel specifi  cation. These will form the basis of questions on practical \nwork in the two AS papers and in Paper 3 of the A level examination. \nYou may be asked to describe these experiments in the examination and\/\nor answer questions based on them. All eight AS Core Practicals  are fully \ndescribed in this Year 1 Student's Book, with a set of typical results and the \nsort of questions you may be asked in the examination.\nMany other experiments are also described in detail. Some are included to \nillustrate and give you a better understanding of the theory, while some are \nparticularly designed to help you develop your practical skills\nThe Edexcel specifi  cation identifi  es particular key practical skills that should \nbe developed through teaching and learning and that will form the basis of \npractical assessment:\n\u25cf independent thinking\n\u25cf use and application of scientifi  c methods and practices\n\u25cf numeracy and the application of mathematical concepts in a practical \ncontext\n\u25cf instruments and equipment.\nFull details of the requirements for practical work, including a comprehensive \nappendix on Uncertainties and practical work , can be found in the specifi  cation \nposted on the Edexcel website: www.edexcel.com.\nBefore we look at these aspects of practical work, however, we need to \nbe clear about certain terminology used in physics, particularly precision, \naccuracy and errors.\nIn the following sections, the bulleted lists in orange  indicate in more detail \nthe skills that will be assessed in the examinations. 2 Practical skills\n807527_C02_Edexcel_Physics_010-024.indd   10 24\/02\/2015   14:06","36":"25 3.1 Speed, velocity and acceleration\n 3 Rectilinear motion\nPrior knowledge\nIn this chapter you will need to be able to:\n\/uni279C substitute numerical values into formulae and equations using appropriate units. \n\/uni279C plot and draw graphs to show how distance and speed change with time \n\/uni279C determine the gradient of linear graphs.\nThe key facts that will be useful are:\n\/uni279C Velocity, acceleration and displacement are vector quantities.\n\/uni279C average velocity = displacement\ntime\n\/uni279C acceleration = change in velocity\ntime\n\/uni279C A body in free fall on Earth accelerates downwards at 9.81 m s\u22122.\nTest yourself on prior knowledge\n1 What is meant by a vector quantity?\n2 Calculate the displacement of an object that travels with an average \nvelocity of 4.5 m s\u22121 for 8.0 s.\n3 The velocity of a car changes from 36 km h\u22121 to 18 km h\u22121 in 8.0 s. \nCalculate the acceleration of the car in m s\u22122.\n4 Calculate the velocity of a brick 2.2 s after it is accidentally dropped \nfrom the top of a building.\n5 Sketch a displacement\u2013time graph for a body moving at constant \nvelocity.\n3.1 Speed, velocity and acceleration\nRectilinear motion means motion along a straight path.
