HYDROGEN BONDS
Y ou were introduced to hydrogen bonds in Section 1A.1. These same bonds are essential in protein 
structures. In amino acids, tiny negative charges are present on the oxygen of  the carboxyl groups and tiny positive charges are present on the hydrogen atoms of  the amino groups. When these charged groups are close to each other, the opposite charges attract, forming a hydrogen bond. Hydrogen bonds are weak but, potentially, they can be made between any two amino acids in the correct position, so there are many of  them holding the protein together very firmly. They are very important in the folding and coiling of  polypeptide chains (see fig C). Hydrogen bonds break easily and reform if  pH or temperature conditions change.
DISULFIDE BONDS
Disulfide bonds form when two cysteine molecules are close together in the structure of  a polypeptide (see fig C). An oxidation reaction occurs between the two sulfur-containing groups, resulting in a strong covalent bond known as a disulfide bond. These disulfide bonds are much stronger than hydrogen bonds but they happen much less often. They are important for holding the folded polypeptide chains in place.

▲ fig C  Hydr ogen bonds and disulfide bonds maintain the shape of protein molecules and this determines  
their function.
IONIC BONDS
Ionic bonds can form between some of  the strongly positive and negative amino acid side chains 
which are sometimes found deep inside the protein molecules. They are strong bonds, but they are not as common as the other structural bonds.
Y our hair is made of  the protein keratin. Some methods of  styling hair change the bonds within the protein 
molecules. Blow drying or straightening hair breaks the hydrogen bonds and temporarily reforms them with the hair curling in a different way until the hydrogen bonds reform in their original places.
Perming is a chemical treatment which is used in some hair salons to completely change the way hair 
looks for weeks or months. The chemicals break the disulfide bonds between the polypeptide chains and reform them in a different place. This effect is permanent – hair will stay styled in that particular way until it is cut off.
PROTEIN STRUCTURE
Proteins can be described by their primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure (see fig D). 
 •T
he primary structure of  a protein is the sequence of  amino acids that make up the polypeptide 
chain, held together by peptide bonds.
 •T
he secondary structure of  a protein is the arrangement of  the polypeptide chain into a regular, 
repeating three-dimensional (3D) structure, held together by hydrogen bonds. One example is the right-handed helix (α-helix), a spiral coil with the peptide bonds forming the backbone and the R groups protruding in all directions. Another is the ß-pleated sheet, in which the polypeptide chain folds into regular pleats held together by hydrogen bonds between the amino and carboxyl ends of  the amino acids. Most fibrous proteins have this type of  structure. Sometimes there is no regular secondary structure and the polypeptide forms a random coil.LEARNING TIP
Remember that fibrous proteins 
have a simpler structure and so tend to be more stable to changes in temperature and pH.

Information: ###""In the primary structure of a protein, the amino acids are linked by peptide (amide) 
bonds. In the secondary, the polypeptide fills into a more complex 3-D structure. Hydrogen and disulfide 
bonds are important in this."
