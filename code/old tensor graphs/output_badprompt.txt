These cells require a supply of  chemical substances such as glucose and oxygen for cellular respiration. These must be transported from outside a large organism into the cells. Respiration supplies energy for the other reactions of  life, but it also produces the toxic waste product carbon dioxide. This and other waste products need to be removed from the cells before they cause damage to them. \nLarge multicellular organisms have internal transport systems that \ncarry substances to every cell in the body. These systems deliver oxygen and nutrients and remove waste so that cells can carry out their functions efficiently. In large complex animals such as humans, chemicals made in a cell in one part of  the body \u2013 such as a hormone like insulin or adrenaline \u2013 may influence a different type of  cell elsewhere in the body. So substances made internally need to be moved around the body as well.\nIn many animals, including all the vertebrates, this transport \nsystem is the heart and circulatory system and the fluid that flows through it. This is an example of  a mass transport system \u2013 substances are transported in the flow of  a fluid with a mechanism for moving it around the body. All large complex organisms have some form of  mass transport system which overcomes the limits of  diffusion between the internal and external environments. Substances are delivered over short distances from the mass transport system to individual cells deep in the body by processes such as diffusion, osmosis and active transport.\nFEATURES OF MASS TRANSPORT SYSTEMS\nMass transport systems are very effective for moving substances around the body. Most mass transport systems have certain features which are the same. They have:\n \u2022e\nxchange surfaces to get materials into and out of  the transport \nsystem\n \u2022a system of\n vessels that carry substances \u2013 these are usually \ntubes, sometimes following a very specific route, sometimes widespread and branching\n \u2022a w\nay of  making sure that substances are moved in the right \ndirection (e.g. nutrients in and waste out)\n \u2022a w\nay of  moving materials fast enough to supply the needs \nof  the organism \u2013 this may involve mechanical methods such as the pumping of  the heart or ways of  maintaining a concentration gradient so that substances move quickly from one place to another (e.g. using active transport)\n \u2022a suita\nble transport medium (e.g. fluid)\n \u2022in man\ny cases, a way of  adapting the rate of  transport to the \nneeds of  the organism.\nCIRCULATION SYSTEMS\nMany animals have a circulatory system in which a heart pumps blood around the body. Insects have an open circulatory system with the blood circulating in large open spaces. However, most larger animals, including mammals, have a closed circulatory system with the blood contained within tubes. The blood makes a continuous journey out to the most distant parts of  the body and back to the heart.\nLEARNING TIP\nThe main advantages of a closed system are:\n\u2022 the pressure can be increased to make the blood flow more quickly\n\u2022 the flow can be directed more precisely to the organs that need \nmost oxygen and nutrients.\nAnimals such as fish have a single circulation system (see fig \nC). The heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the gills, the organs \nof  gas exchange where the blood takes in oxygen (becomes oxygenated) and gives up carbon dioxide at the same time. The blood then travels on around the rest of  the body of  the fish, giving up oxygen to the body cells before returning to the\u00a0heart.\ngill\ncapillarie saorta\nventricle atriumsystemic\ncapillarie s\n\u25b2 fig C  T he single circulation of a fish  \nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that mass flow is like a stream with all the components \nflowing together.\nBirds and mammals need much more oxygen than fish. Not \nonly do they have to move around without the support of  water, but they also maintain a constant body temperature that may be higher or lower than their surroundings. This takes a lot of  resources, so their cells need plenty of  oxygen and glucose and make waste products that need to be removed quickly. Birds and mammals have evolved the most complex type of  transport system, known as a double circulation because it involves two separate circulation systems. The systemic circulation carries oxygenated blood (oxygen-rich blood) from the heart to the cells of  the body where the oxygen is used. It also carries the deoxygenated blood (blood that has given up its oxygen to the body cells) back to the heart. The pulmonary circulation carries\u00a0deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs to be oxygenated and then carries the oxygenated blood back to the heart (see fig D).\nThe separate circuits of  a double circulatory system ensure that \nthe oxygenated and deoxygenated blood cannot mix, so the tissues receive as much oxygen as possible. Another big advantage is that the fully oxygenated blood can be delivered quickly to the body tissues at high pressure. The blood going through the tiny blood vessels in the lungs is at relatively low pressure, so it does \nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

There are several different types of  leucocyte, which you will study further in  Book 2 Chapter 6B. \nPLATELETS\nPlatelets are tiny fragments of  large cells called megakaryocytes, which are found in the bone marrow. There are about 150\n 000\u2013400\n 000 pla\ntelets per mm3 of  blood. They are \ninvolved in blood clotting (see page 35).\nTRANSPORT OF OXYGEN\nThe many haemoglobin molecules that are in the red blood cells transport oxygen. Each haemoglobin molecule is a large globular protein consisting of  four peptide chains, each with an iron-containing prosthetic group. Each group can collect four molecules of  oxygen in a reversible process to form oxyhaemoglobin:\n   Hb + 4O2 \u21cb Hb.4O2   ____________________________________     haemoglobin + oxygen \u21cb oxyhaemoglobin     \nT\nhe first oxygen molecule that binds to the haemoglobin changes \nthe arrangement of  the molecule making it easier for the following oxygen molecules to bind. The final oxygen molecule binds several hundred times faster than the first. The same process happens in reverse when oxygen dissociates from haemoglobin \u2013 it gets progressively harder to remove the oxygen.\nEXAM HINT\nAlways use suitable scientific terms. This is important because it can \nhelp to focus a response clearly.\nWhen the blood enters the lungs, the concentration of  oxygen \nin the red blood cells is relatively low. Oxygen moves into the red blood cells from the air in the lungs by diffusion. The oxygen is collected and bound to the haemoglobin, so the free oxygen concentration in the cytoplasm of  the red blood cells stays low. This maintains a steep concentration gradient from the air in the lungs to the red blood cells, so more and more oxygen diffuses in and joins onto the haemoglobin.The oxygen levels are relatively low in the body tissues. The concentration of  oxygen in the cytoplasm of  the red blood cells is higher than in the surrounding tissue. As a result, oxygen moves out into the body cells by diffusion down its concentration gradient. The haemoglobin molecules give up some of  their oxygen. When you are at rest or exercising gently, only about 25% of  the oxygen carried by the haemoglobin is released into your cells. There is another 75% in reserve in the transport system for when you are very active.\nThe strong affinity of  haemoglobin for oxygen means that a \nsmall change in the proportion of  oxygen in the surrounding environment can have a big effect on the saturation of  the blood with oxygen. So in the lungs, the haemoglobin rapidly gains oxygen and in the tissues, as the oxygen saturation of  the environment falls, oxygen is released rapidly (see fig C).\n0100\n50\nPartial pressure of oxygenAs deoxygenated blood approaches the lungs, the steep part of the curv e\nmeans that a small increase in partial pr essure  causes a large increase in\n% saturation.\nAs oxygenated blood approaches the tissues, a small decre ase in\npartial pressure causes a large decrease in % saturation (i.e. a large\nrelease of oxygen).Percentage saturation of \nhaemoglobin with oxygenhigh partial\npressureof oxygen \u2013the conditionsin the lungs\nthe \u2018predicted\u2019 straight linethe actual sigmoid curve\nlow partial pressure ofoxygen \u2013 the conditionsin the respiring tissues\n\u25b2 fig C  Oxy gen dissociation curve for human haemoglobin\nTRANSPORT OF CARBON DIOXIDE\nWaste carbon dioxide diffuses from the respiring cells of  the \nbody tissues into the blood along a concentration gradient. The reaction of  the carbon dioxide with water is crucial. When carbon dioxide is dissolved in the blood it reacts slowly with the water to form carbonic acid, H\n2CO3. The carbonic acid separates to form \nhydrogen ions H+ and hydrogencarbonate ions HCO3\u2013:\nCO2 + H2O \u21cb H2CO3 \u21cb HCO3\u2013 + H+\nAbout 5% of  the carbon dioxide is carried in solution in the plasma. A further 10\u201320% combines with haemoglobin molecules to make carbaminohaemoglobin. Most of  the carbon dioxide is transported in the cytoplasm of  the red blood cells as hydrogencarbonate ions. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase controls the rate of  the reaction between carbon dioxide and water to produce carbonic acid.\nIn the body tissues, there is a high concentration of  carbon dioxide \nin the blood, so carbonic anhydrase catalyses the formation of  carbonic acid.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

Make it clear that both atria pump at the same time and both ventricles pump at the same time.\n1 T he inferior vena cava collects deoxygenated blood from the \nlower parts of  the body, while the superior vena cava receives \ndeoxygenated blood from the head, neck, arms and chest. Deoxygenated blood is delivered to the right atrium.\n2\n T\nhe right atrium receives the blood from the great veins. As it \nfills with blood, the pressure builds up and opens the tricuspid valve, so the right ventricle starts to fill with blood too. When the atrium is full it contracts, forcing more blood into the ventricle. The atrium has thin muscular walls because it receives blood at low pressure from the inferior vena cava and the superior vena cava and it needs to exert relatively little pressure to move the blood into the ventricle. One-way semilunar valves (like the valves in veins described in Section\u00a01B.3) at the entrance to the atrium stop a backflow of  blood into the veins.\n3\n \nThe tricuspid valve consists of  three flaps and is also \nknown as an atrioventricular valve because it separates an atrium from a ventricle. The valve allows blood to pass from the atrium to the ventricle, but not in the other direction. The tough tendinous cords, also known as valve tendons or heartstrings, make sure the valves are not turned inside out by the pressure exerted when the ventricles contract.\n4\n T\nhe right ventricle is filled with blood under some pressure \nwhen the right atrium contracts, then the ventricle contracts. Its muscular walls produce the pressure needed to force blood out of  the heart into the pulmonary arteries. These carry the deoxygenated blood to the capillaries in the lungs. As the ventricle starts to contract, the tricuspid valve closes to prevent blood flowing into the atrium. Semilunar valves, like those in veins, prevent the blood flowing back from the arteries into the ventricle.\n5\n T\nhe blood returns from the lungs to the left side of  the heart in \nthe pulmonary veins. The blood is at relatively low pressure after passing through the extensive capillaries of  the lungs. The blood returns to the left atrium, another thin-walled chamber that performs the same function as the right atrium. It contracts to force blood into the left ventricle. Backflow is prevented by another atrioventricular valve known as the bicuspid valve , which has only two flaps.\n6\n As the left a\ntrium contracts, the bicuspid valve opens and the \nleft ventricle is filled with blood under pressure. As the left ventricle starts to contract the bicuspid valve closes to prevent backflow of  blood to the left atrium. The left ventricle pumps the blood out of  the heart and into the aorta, the major artery of  the body. This carries blood away from the heart at even higher pressure than the major arteries that branch off  from it. \nThe muscular wall of  the left side of  the heart is much thicker than that of  the right. The right side pumps blood to the lungs, which are relatively close to the heart. The delicate capillaries of  the lungs need blood delivered at relatively low pressure. The left side must produce sufficient force to move the blood under pressure to all the extremities of  the body and overcome the elastic recoil of  the arteries. Semilunar valves prevent the blood flowing back from the aorta into the ventricle.\nLEARNING TIP\nRemember that the valves do not operate on their own. They open \nand close as blood pressure changes in the chambers on either side of the valve. When the pressure is higher on one side it will push the valve open. When it is higher on the other side, it will close the valve.\nThe septum is a thick wall of  muscle and connective tissue \nbetween the two sides of  the heart. It prevents the oxygenated blood mixing with the deoxygenated blood. \nDID YOU KNOW? \nIn an embryo, there is a gap in the septum called the foramen ovale and the blood from the two sides of the heart can mix. This does not matter because the lungs of the fetus do not function and little blood flows to them. At birth, this hole closes over as the lungs begin to function. If it does not, the baby has a condition called patent foramen ovale or \u2018hole in the heart\u2019 . This may be  so small it does not really matter. If it is large, it must be closed  by surgery.\nDID YOU KNOW? \nInside the heart\nThe diagrams we use of the inside of a mammalian heart make it \nlook very clean and simple (see fig A). But when you dissect the heart of a mammal such as a sheep or a cow, you can see that it is much more complicated. Cutting open a heart and exploring the connections between the blood vessels and the chambers of the heart, and seeing the structure of the valves, helps you understand how it works as a three-dimensional pump (see fig C).\n\u25b2 fig C  A dissected mammalian heart\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

These cells accumulate chemicals from the blood, especially cholesterol. This leads to a plaque (also known as an atheroma) forming on the endothelial lining of  the artery (see fig C). Fibrous tissue and calcium salts also build up (increase in amount) around the atheroma, turning it into a hardened plaque. This hardened area means that part of  the artery wall is less elastic and narrower than it should be. This is atherosclerosis and is summarised in fig B.\nThe plaque causes the lumen of  the artery to become much smaller. This increases the blood \npressure, making it harder for the heart to pump blood around the body. The raised blood pressure makes damage more likely in other areas of  the endothelial lining and more plaques will form.  This will make the blood pressure even higher, and so the problem gets worse. There are many factors that are linked to the development of  atherosclerosis. Y ou will look at these in more detail  in Chapter 1C.\nEFFECT OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS ON HEALTH\nAtherosclerosis can have many serious effects on the health of  an individual. The development  of  atherosclerosis can be summarised as: damage to the endothelium of  the arteries \u2192 inflammatory response \u2192 accumulation of  cholesterol \u2192 atheroma \u2192 fibrous tissue/calcium salts \u2192 plaque \u2192 narrowing/loss of  elasticity of  the artery.\nANEURYSMS\nIf  an area of  an artery is narrowed by plaque, blood tends to collect behind the blockage. The artery bulges and the wall is put under more pressure than usual, so it becomes weakened. This is known as an aneurysm. The weakened artery wall may split open, leading to massive internal bleeding. Aneurysms frequently happen in the blood vessels supplying the brain or in the aorta, especially when it passes through the abdomen. The massive blood loss and drop in blood pressure are often fatal, but if  aneurysms are diagnosed they can be treated by surgery before they burst.\nRAISED BLOOD PRESSURE\nThe arteries narrowed due to plaques on the walls cause raised blood pressure. This can lead to severe damage in a number of  organs, including the kidneys, the eyes and the brain. The high pressure damages the tiny blood vessels where your kidney filters out urea and other substances from the blood. If  the vessels feeding the kidney tubules become narrowed, the pressure inside them gets even higher and proteins may be forced out through their walls. If  you have high blood pressure, your doctors can test for protein in your urine as a sign of  kidney damage. \nSimilarly, the tiny blood vessels supplying the retina of  your eye are easily damaged. If  they become \nblocked or leak, the retinal cells are starved of  oxygen and die and this can cause blindness. \nBleeding from the capillaries into the brain results in one type of  stroke (see below).\nHEART DISEASE\nThere are many kinds of  heart disease, but the two most common ones are angina and myocardial \ninfarction (heart attack); both are closely linked to atherosclerosis (see figs B and D ).\nIn angina, plaques build up slowly in the coronary arteries, reducing blood flow to the parts of  the heart muscle beyond the plaques. Often symptoms are first noticed during exercise, when the cardiac muscle is working harder and needs more oxygen. The narrowed coronary arteries cannot supply enough oxygenated blood and the heart muscle resorts to anaerobic respiration. This causes a gripping pain in the chest that can extend into the arms, particularly the left one, and the jaw, and often also causes breathlessness. The symptoms of  angina subside once exercise stops, but the experience is painful and frightening.\nFortunately, most angina is relatively mild. It can be helped by taking regular exercise, losing weight \nand not smoking. The symptoms can be treated by drugs that cause rapid dilation of  the coronary blood vessels so that they supply the cardiac muscle with the oxygen it needs. However, if  the blockage of  the coronary arteries continues to get worse, so will the symptoms of  the angina. Other drugs are then used to dilate the blood vessels and reduce the heart rate. Unfortunately, drugs cannot \n\u25b2 fig C  F atty deposits like these \nin an artery cause disease and death in millions of people  every year.\nEXAM HINT\nMake sure you are clear about \nall of the different terms.

We need to show \nhow one thing causes another and we still don\u2019t really know how fruit and vegetables have their effect. They are very varied in their chemistry. For some time, it was thought that the antioxidants found in fruit and vegetables might be the answer. Vitamins, such as vitamin A found in carrots, vitamin C from citrus fruits and vitamin E from leafy green vegetables, almonds and sunflower oil, are antioxidants and they are found in fruits and vegetables. Several studies appeared to show that antioxidants were the answer and many people started taking antioxidant supplements to protect their hearts. However, recent studies, including some very large metadata analyses (studies where scientists have looked at the results of  many different investigations), have shown that the evidence for antioxidants being good for your heart is inconclusive. There is some evidence that some antioxidants may cause harm.\nVITAMIN C: A CASE STUDY\nVitamin C is important in the formation of  connective tissue in the body, such as in the bones, teeth, skin and many internal body surfaces including the endothelial lining of  blood vessels. A severe lack of  vitamin C in the diet causes scurvy, which can result in bleeding gums, bruising easily and painful joints. As you have seen, if  the lining of  an artery is damaged, atherosclerosis is more likely to develop. So, it makes sense, in theory, that if  your diet is low in vitamin C, your arteries are more likely to be damaged and you are more likely to be affected by CVD. \nA study published in the British Medical Journal in 1997 looked at the association between \nconcentration of  vitamin C in the blood and risk of  heart attack in 1605 men from eastern Finland.

Why do they do this? \nPREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE \nCardiovascular disease has a negative effect on individuals, on families  and on society. It costs a lot of  money to treat people in hospital. When  people are too ill to work, they are losing money for their families, and  also for the companies where they work. Treating people with drugs to  prevent them from needing surgery is cheaper for health service providers.  It is even cheaper (and better for the individual) if  we can stop ourselves  needing the drugs. So, prevention is better than treatment for CVDs for  many reasons (see fig A). However, persuading people to change their  \nlifestyle habits is often difficult.\nFor example, there is a lot of  reliable evidence to show that smoking is  \none of  the highest risk factors for CVDs. However, if  you stop smoking,  your risk of  developing heart disease is almost halved after just one year.  Moreover, research carried out by a team led by Azra Mahmud from  Trinity College Dublin and published in 2007 suggests that after 10 years,  the arteries of  smokers who stop smoking are the same as if  they had  never smoked. There is a lot of  support available for people who want to  stop smoking. Y et, despite all this, almost 1 billion people around the  world smoke cigarettes and millions of  them die each year of  CVDs and  cancers linked to their smoking. \nHealth education programmes in schools and communities can help to  \nmake sure that everyone is aware of  the risks associated with different  lifestyle choices. However, each individual has to make their own choices  and take their own risks.\nOVERWEIGHT OR UNDERFIT?\nMost people are aware that obesity is linked to CVDs, and many go on  slimming diets to try to lose weight. Most people also know that taking  regular exercise helps protect against CVDs \u2013 but more people choose to  go on a diet than choose to take regular exercise. The results of  a study  carried out over an average of  eight years on 20\n 000 men a\nged from  \n30 to 83 years are given in Section 1C.4 fig\u00a0B. Fitness was defined by  how much oxygen they used during exercise. The results show that if  you  are obese and fit you have a lower risk of  dying from CVDs than someone  who is not obese but unfit.

There is much scientific evidence about the main factors that increase the risk of  heart disease. \nA\u00a0lot of  that evidence is used by governments and health organisations to produce advice on how to improve our health. Why do they do this? \nPREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE \nCardiovascular disease has a negative effect on individuals, on families  and on society. It costs a lot of  money to treat people in hospital. When  people are too ill to work, they are losing money for their families, and  also for the companies where they work. Treating people with drugs to  prevent them from needing surgery is cheaper for health service providers.  It is even cheaper (and better for the individual) if  we can stop ourselves  needing the drugs. So, prevention is better than treatment for CVDs for  many reasons (see fig A). However, persuading people to change their  \nlifestyle habits is often difficult. \nFor example, there is a lot of  reliable evidence to show that smoking is  \none of  the highest risk"], "6": ["and theatre and cinema sta ff  are required mainly in the \nevening.

There could be greater \nreliance on written communication methods because \nof this.\n\u25a0 Motivation levels may be adversely a ff ected because \npart-time sta ff  may feel less involved and committed to \nthe business than full-time workers. It will be much more \ndiff icult to establish a teamwork culture if all the sta ff  \nnever actually meet each other because of their di ff erent \nworking hours.\n\u25a0 Workers may have more than one zero hours contract \nwith di ff erent employers and they may not be available \nimmediately if they are called on to work.Disadvantages for the workers\n\u25a0 They will be earning less than full-time workers.\n\u25a0 They may be paid at a lower rate than full-time workers.\n\u25a0 The security of employment and other working \nconditions are o ft en inferior to those of full-time workers. \nThis is now changing in some countries. In all of the states \nof the European Union for example, the law now gives \nas many employment rights to part-time as to full-time \nworkers. This is still not the case in other regions of \nthe world.\nTemporary contracts\nOff ering temporary employment contracts is another way \nfi rms use to reduce the overhead costs of employing sta ff  \nwhen there may be less demand for them. Lower levels of \njob security can mean that safety needs, as identi fi ed by \nMaslow, may not be satis fi ed and this will have a negative \neff ect on motivation. Temporary contracts can be either \nfull-time or part-time. Th ey are contracts for fi xed periods \nof time as opposed to permanent contracts. Permanent \ncontracts end only when a worker is sacked (for example \nfor poor discipline), made redundant (for example when \ndemand has fallen) or leaves of their own accord. Th e \nadvantages and drawbacks of temporary contracts are \nsimilar to those of part-time contracts, especially the \nbene fi t of fl exibility o ff ered to employers. Such fl exibility is \nparticularly important to seasonal business activities, such \nas fruit picking.\nTh e  c o m b i n a t i o n  o f  p a r t - t i m e  a n d  t e m p o r a r y  c o n t r a c t s  \ngives fi rms the chance to create a small team of full-time \nstaff , called core workers, and combine this with a number \nof fl exible workers, who are employed only as and when \nnecessary.

Recent \nmanagement thinking has been not to seek to oppose \nworkers\u2019 suggestions and those of their union leaders, but \nto actively involve them in important decision-making and \noperational issues. In much of modern industry, therefore, \nthere is much less confrontation, far fewer strikes and a \ngreat deal more harmony and working towards common \ngoals than there was in the 1960s and 1970s.\nIt is a commonly held view, at least in developed \neconomies, that labour \u2212management relations, based on \nmutual respect, understanding and common aims, are \nlikely to lead to a competitive and productive business that \nwill be able to survive the added strains of a globalised \neconomy. Indeed, participation and employee involvement \ncould become a signi fi cant factor determining the long-term \nsuccess of business in rapidly changing market conditions.\nReasons for and role of a workforce plan\nHR departments need to calculate the future sta ffi  ng needs \nof the business. Failure to do this can lead to too few or too \nmany sta ff  or sta ff  with the wrong skills. HR departments \nmust work in close harmony with the corporate plan of \nthe business and the objectives this contains. If the overall \nbusiness plan is to expand production and develop products \nfor foreign markets, then this must be re fl ected in the workforce plan \u00a0\u2013 which becomes part of the fi rm\u2019s strategy \nto meet its long-term goals. So, workforce planning  means \nthinking ahead and establishing the number and skills \nof the workforce required by the business in the future to \nmeet its planned objectives. Th e s e  t w o  f a c t o r s  n e e d  c a r e f u l  \nthought and the starting point is always a workforce audit .\nWorkforce planning: analysing and forecasting the \nnumbers of workers and the skills of those workers that will \nbe required by the organisation to achieve its objectives.\nWorkforce audit: a check on the skills and qualifications \nof all existing workers/managers.\nKEY TERMS\nOnce this has been conducted, the next stages in \nworkforce planning are to assess how many additional \nemployees and skills might be needed.\n1 The number of employees\nTh e number of employees required in the future depends \non many factors:\n\u25a0 Forecast demand for the firm\u2019s product:  This will be \ninfluenced by market and external conditions, seasonal \nfactors, competitors\u2019 actions, trends in consumer tastes \nand so on. It could be a mistake to replace a worker who \ndecides to leave the firm if consumer demand is falling \nor if there is likely to be a seasonal downturn in demand. \nDemand forecasts may be necessary to help establish \nworkforce planning needs, but we know that these are \nsubject to margins of error. For this reason, some firms \nallow some additional sta ff ing to be built into the plan to \nallow for unplanned increases in demand. An alternative \nmight be to recruit temporary or part-time sta ff  with \nflexible hours\u2019 contracts \u00a0\u2013 this issue is studied in more \ndetail later.\n\u25a0 The productivity levels of sta ff : I f  p r o d u c t i v i t y  ( o u t p u t  p e r  \nworker) is forecast to increase \u00a0\u2013 perhaps as a result of more \neff icient machinery \u00a0\u2013 then fewer sta ff  will be needed to \nproduce the same level of output.\n\u25a0 The objectives of the business:  This could influence future \nworkforce numbers in two main ways. Firstly, if the business \nplans to expand over the coming years, then sta ff i n g  n u m be rs \nwill have to rise to accommodate this growth. Secondly, if the \nfirm intends to increase customer-service levels, possibly at \nthe expense of short-term profits, then more workers might \nneed to be recruited. A workforce plan cannot be devised \nwithout consideration of business objectives.\n\u25a0 Changes in the law regarding workers\u2019 rights:  If the \ngovernment of a country decides to pass laws that establish \na shorter maximum working week or introduce a minimum \nwage level, then there will be a considerable impact on \nthe workforce plan. A shorter working week might lead to 178Cambridge International AS and A Level Business", ":\n###Information:###No common objectives established between labour and management.\u25a0 Non-existent job enrichment and no sta ff involvement or participation in important decisions that can lead to better results.2 Collective bargaining between trade unions and major employers and their associationsCollective bargaining is when representatives of unions and national employers negotiate wage levels and working conditions for the whole industry or for large sections of it.

Th e  e s s e n t i a l  d i ff erence between cash and \nprofi t can be explained with three simple examples:\nExample 1:  Jhumpa buys fresh fi sh from a market every \nday. She pays cash to the traders and gets a good deal \nbecause of this. She sells all of her stock on a high-street \nstall to shoppers who also pay her cash.\n\u25a0 In a typical week Jhumpa buys fish costing $1,000 and sells \nit for $2,000.\n\u25a0 How much profit does she make in a typical week (ignore \nother costs)? $1,000.\n\u25a0 What was the di ff erence between her cash inflows and \noutflows in a typical week? $1,000 too \u00a0\u2013 as all purchases \nand sales were in cash.\n\u25a0 In this very simplified example, cash = profit at the end of \nthe week (but we have ignored other expenses too).\nCash inflows: payments in cash received by a business, \nsuch as those from customers (trade receivables) or from \nthe bank, e.g. receiving a loan.\nCash outflows: payments in cash made by a business, \nsuch as those to suppliers and workers.\nKEY TERMS\nExample 2:  Shula owns Fine Foods, a specialist \ndelicatessen. Last month she bought $500 of fresh goods \nfrom a supplier who o ff ers her one month\u2019s credit. Th e goods sold very slowly during the month and she was \nforced to cut her prices several times. Eventually she sold \nthem all for only $300, paid in cash by her customers.\n\u25a0 What was her profit or loss (ignoring all other costs)? A loss \nof $200 \u00a0\u2013 because even though she has not yet paid for the \ngoods they are still recorded as a cost.\n\u25a0 What was the di ff erence between her cash outflow and \ninflow? A positive inflow $300 \u00a0\u2013 because she has not paid the \nsupplier yet. So Shula has a positive cash flow from these \ngoods this month even though she made a loss on them.\n\u25a0 Cash was not the same as profit for this business.\nExample 3:  Sanjit is concerned about competition for his \njewellery shop. He buys most of his stock over the Internet \nfor cash \u00a0\u2013 but has decided to increase the credit terms \nhe gives to his customers to two months. Last month he \nbought some rings for $3,000 and paid in cash. He sold \nthem all in the same month for $7,000\u2013 yet will not receive \npayment until two months\u2019 time.\n\u25a0 How much profit did he make on these rings? $4,000 \u00a0\u2013 the \nrings have been sold and revenue recorded from the sale \neven though no cash payment has been made.\n\u25a0 What was Sanjit\u2019s cash-flow position from these deals? \nA negative outflow of $3,000 \u00a0\u2013 he may be very short of \ncash until he receives payment from his customers.\n\u25a0 Cash was not the same as profit for this business \u00a0\u2013 and \nthere is a real danger that it could run out of cash to pay its \neveryday costs, such as wages and rent.\nTOP TIP\nWhen given the opportunity, emphasise the importance \nof having enough cash in the short term. Profit can wait \nto be earned in the long term \u00a0\u2013 but cash payments are \nalways being made.\nHow to forecast cash flow\nForecasting cash fl ow means trying to estimate future cash \ninfl ows and cash out fl ows, usually on a month-by-month \nbasis.

These same bonds are essential in protein \nstructures. In amino acids, tiny negative charges are present on the oxygen of  the carboxyl groups and tiny positive charges are present on the hydrogen atoms of  the amino groups. When these charged groups are close to each other, the opposite charges attract, forming a hydrogen bond. Hydrogen bonds are weak but, potentially, they can be made between any two amino acids in the correct position, so there are many of  them holding the protein together very firmly. They are very important in the folding and coiling of  polypeptide chains (see fig C). Hydrogen bonds break easily and reform if  pH or temperature conditions change.\nDISULFIDE BONDS\nDisulfide bonds form when two cysteine molecules are close together in the structure of  a polypeptide (see fig C). An oxidation reaction occurs between the two sulfur-containing groups, resulting in a strong covalent bond known as a disulfide bond. These disulfide bonds are much stronger than hydrogen bonds but they happen much less often. They are important for holding the folded polypeptide chains in place.\nhydrogen bondhydrogen bond\ndisul\ufb01de bonddisul\ufb01de bond\n\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b1-helix\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\u03b2-pleated sheet\n\u25b2 fig C  Hydr ogen bonds and disulfide bonds maintain the shape of protein molecules and this determines  \ntheir function.\nIONIC BONDS\nIonic bonds can form between some of  the strongly positive and negative amino acid side chains \nwhich are sometimes found deep inside the protein molecules. They are strong bonds, but they are not as common as the other structural bonds.\nY our hair is made of  the protein keratin. Some methods of  styling hair change the bonds within the protein \nmolecules. Blow drying or straightening hair breaks the hydrogen bonds and temporarily reforms them with the hair curling in a different way until the hydrogen bonds reform in their original places.\nPerming is a chemical treatment which is used in some hair salons to completely change the way hair \nlooks for weeks or months. The chemicals break the disulfide bonds between the polypeptide chains and reform them in a different place. This effect is permanent \u2013 hair will stay styled in that particular way until it is cut off.\nPROTEIN STRUCTURE\nProteins can be described by their primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure (see fig\u00a0D). \n \u2022T\nhe primary structure of  a protein is the sequence of  amino acids that make up the polypeptide \nchain, held together by peptide bonds.\n \u2022T\nhe secondary structure of  a protein is the arrangement of  the polypeptide chain into a regular, \nrepeating three-dimensional (3D) structure, held together by hydrogen bonds. One example is the right-handed helix (\u03b1-helix), a spiral coil with the peptide bonds forming the backbone and the R\u00a0groups protruding in all directions. Another is the \u00df-pleated sheet, in which the polypeptide chain folds into regular pleats held together by hydrogen bonds between the amino and carboxyl ends of  the amino acids. Most fibrous proteins have this type of  structure. Sometimes there is no regular secondary structure and the polypeptide forms a random coil.LEARNING TIP\nRemember that fibrous proteins \nhave a simpler structure and so tend to be more stable to changes in temperature and pH.\nUncorrected proof, all content subject to change at publisher discretion.

These same bonds are essential in protein \nstructures. In amino acids, tiny negative charges are present on the oxygen of  the carboxyl groups and tiny positive charges are present on the hydrogen atoms of  the amino groups. When these charged groups are close to each other, the opposite charges attract, forming a hydrogen bond. Hydrogen bonds are weak but, potentially, they can be made between any two amino acids in the correct position, so there are many of  them holding the protein together very firmly. They are very important in the folding and coiling of  polypeptide chains (see fig C). Hydrogen bonds break easily and reform if  pH or temperature conditions change.\nDISULFIDE BONDS\nDisulfide bonds form when two cysteine molecules are close together in the structure of  a polypeptide (see fig C). An oxidation reaction occurs between the two sulfur-containing groups, resulting in a strong covalent bond known as a disulfide bond. These disulfide bonds are much stronger than hydrogen bonds but they happen much less often. They are important for holding the folded pol"]}
